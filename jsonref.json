It is a fate worse than death.\u0027The conniving candidate also makes promises that go against her Democratic platform to get endorsements from congressmen, telling one that she\u0027ll increase the amount of land available for oil drilling and another that she\u0027ll outlaw same sex marriage. When her lesbian daughter Catherine (Sarah Sutherland) expresses outrage at that second promise, Selina replies: \u0027It\u0027s just the party platform, it\u0027s like a to-do list of things we\u0027re not going to do.\u0027          Selina\u0027s campaign adviser Kent Davison (Gary Cole) and former chief of staff Amy Brookheimer (Anna Chlumsky) are seen trying to convince her not to pick Jonah Ryan to be her VP. She responds by railing against the position she previously held, telling them : \u0027Being vice president is like being declawed, defanged, neutered, ball-gagged and sealed in an abandoned coal mine under two miles of human s***. It is a fate worse than death\u0027Perhaps Selina\u0027s largest hurdle is an investigation into the Meyer Fund, which her husband Andrew (David Pasquesi) was stealing money from using checks in her name. His scheme appears to be seconds from going public, threatening to ruin her chances and making the White House. Just before Selina goes on stage to accept her nomination, one of her advisers warns her that \u0027someone will have to go down\u0027 for the Meyer Fund. She says: \u0027I know\u0027 with an unnerving smile that makes it clear she\u0027s found a fall guy. Sadly, but not surprisingly, that fall guy is Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) the ever-loyal minder who has been by her side constantly. Though Gary can read Selina\u0027s mind in many situations, like when she\u0027s hungry or needs hand sanitizer, he doesn\u0027t see this one coming. He is standing on the edge of the stage offering Selina her favorite lipstick when she begins to tell him what she\u0027s done - before he interrupts her to pick a chia seed out of her teeth. Selina ends up just saying \u0027nevermind\u0027 with a shrug as she takes the stage to accept her nomination. While she\u0027s at the microphone she looks to the side to see a blindsided Gary being arrested by FBI agents.            One of the many schemes Selina orchestrated to seal her place in the Oval Office involved making her ever-loyal aide Gary Walsh (Tony Hale) take the fall for her husband\u0027s fraud         Selina winces on stage at the Democratic National Convention as she stands in front of the crowd with her disastrous new running mate Jonah Ryan (Timothy Simons)It\u0027s not until the last seven minutes that the episode feels like a finale. After the nomination scene the story skips ahead six months to see Selina settled into the Oval Office.  Sue Wilson (Sufe Bradshaw) is back to being Selina\u0027s brutally blunt receptionist, just as she was in earlier seasons.  When Jonah shows up looking to speak with Selina, Sue makes it clear in very few words that that\u0027s not going to happen. Seeing the vice president stand outside the Oval Office unable to get a minute with the president feels full-circle.  The next scene shows Selina in her office with her two top aides, her former campaign manager Bob Bradley (Martin Mull) and James\u0027 former campaign manager Michelle. She gripes about being hungry before calling out for Gary, who is presumably in prison. Bob reminds her that Gary isn\u0027t there and offers to get her something to eat. When he asks what she wants, Selina snaps: \u0027You figure that out\u0027 - something only Gary was ever able to do. The two aides leave the room and we see Selina\u0027s face fall as she realizes she\u0027s alone, having alienated everyone who helped get her into the White House. The moment doesn\u0027t last long - this is a comedy, after all.           The series flashes forward six months to show Selina sitting in the Oval Office and realizing she is all alone after driving everyone in her life awayThe final four or so minutes of the show take place 24 years in the future in 2044, just after Selina\u0027s death.   Reporting on the late president\u0027s funeral procession on TV is Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock (Matt Walsh). Having failed miserably in that role and struggled early on in his subsequent journalism career, a graying Mike appears to have finally hit his stride.  He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and made good on her promise to outlaw same sex marriage.          Selina\u0027s former communications director Mike McLintock is anchoring the news during the late president\u0027s funeral. He gives the viewer a tiny glimpse into what happened with Selina\u0027s presidency as he describes how she freed Tibet and outlawed same sex marriageNext we see many of the core characters reunite at Selina\u0027s funeral, including several of her political rivals. Through Mike\u0027s newscast we learn that the current president is Richard Splett (Sam Richardson), the bumbling political aide who helped run Selina\u0027s campaign, despite her protestations.  Amy is happily married to campaign manager Bill Ericsson (Diedrich Bader) and is the proud mother to greyhounds. She catches up with an overly-botoxed and tanned Dan Egan (Reid Scott), now married to a 20-something blonde. Both Amy and Dan are shocked to see that Gary showed up for the funeral even though Selina apparently never visited him in prison. He places her favorite lipstick on her casket and whispers: \u0027You would hate these flowers.\u0027   We see Jonah watching the funeral from home, griping to his wife slash step-sister that he\u0027s glad he wasn\u0027t there. She responds that its a good thing he got impeached so they didn\u0027t have to invite him.  Catherine is also watching from home and celebrating being free from her judgmental and absent mother. Catherine\u0027s ex-Secret Service agent lover Marjorie Palmiotti (Clea DuVall) tells her now-grown son that \u0027losing a parent is hard\u0027 before the not-so-grieving daughter saunters in with a tray of margaritas and a big grin.          Gary showed up to Selina\u0027s funeral 24 years after she betrayed him even though she never visited him in prison.

I\u0027m not wishing that, I\u0027m saying anything could happen.\u0027 The spectacular overshadowing is a fitting end for Veep\u0027s bitter and battled anti-hero, who surely thought she deserved a much grander sendoff.             As the credits start rolling on one side of the screen, Mike comes back on and begins paying tribute to Selina before receiving breaking news that actor Tom Hanks has died at the age of 88"},{"url":null,"title":"Doris day Hollywoods queen tears cry about","story":"Share this article \u0027She was a true star in more ways than one,\u0027 added Sir Paul. \u0027I will miss her but will always remember her twinkling smile and infectious laugh as well as the many great songs and movies she gave us.\u0027With her blonde hair, dazzling smile and perky screen presence, Doris Day became a huge box office draw in films such as Pillow Talk, Move Over Darling and Calamity Jane, sharing chaste love scenes in romantic comedies with Rock Hudson, Cary Grant and James Garner.         But the star endured a difficult childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriageAlthough she made 39 films and many TV shows, she is best remembered for a song — Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be) — which she belted out to James Stewart in the Hitchcock film The Man Who Knew Too Much. Years later, Day liked to say \u0027Que Sera, Sera\u0027 to fend off intrusive questions about a personal life that was the opposite of the sparkling romances of her films.Although her wholesome, sunny image was a construct of her Hollywood advisors — the pianist Oscar Levant once quipped: \u0027I knew Doris Day before she was a virgin\u0027 — she didn\u0027t want to disappoint fans and she played along for years.She was born Doris Mary Ann Kappelhoff in a German neighbourhood of Cincinnati, Ohio, on April 3, 1922 — and suffered an unhappy childhood that was overshadowed by her parents\u0027 toxic marriage. Her father was a professional musician who hated popular songs — and to bait him, Day\u0027s mother would get the little girl to perform a song he particularly loathed.         Her third husband Marty Melcher was a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future filmsAs a young child, she caught her father with another woman, creeping into a bedroom during a party at their home. She recalled crying herself to sleep listening to them. \u0027I heard him and I heard her,\u0027 she said.From her childhood onwards, Doris said she dreamed of being the perfect wife with a perfect husband. It\u0027s possible she just tried too hard — at least two of her husbands would blame her for the break-up of their relationships while a third would say she was too exhausting to keep up with.Doris was encouraged by her mother to become a dancer but such ambitions were shattered when, aged 13, she was involved in a terrible car accident. The car, driven by a friend after a pahurty, became stuck on the rails at a level crossing and was crushed by an oncoming train. One of Doris\u0027s legs was crushed and she spent over a year on crutches.         The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romanceShe turned to singing instead. A local bandleader, Barney Rapp, gave her a job and her stage name after hearing her sing \u0027Day By Day\u0027. Doris was just 17 when she fell in love with trombonist Al Jorden who helped her with her singing. They married when she was 19.Jorden immediately showed a dark side to his character when he punched her on their wedding night, the first of many beatings. When she became pregnant, he insisted that she have an abortion. When she refused, he hit her in the stomach in the hope that she would lose their baby.She didn\u0027t, although by the time their son, Terry, was born, she had managed to flee her brutal and paranoid husband.For all her dreams of being the perfect wife, Doris was hardly the perfect mother. She soon went back on the road with her band and left her mother, Alma, to bring up her son. Terry — her only child — would later say that \u0027mother\u0027 was a word for him that had no meaning. \u0027My grandmother was my total parent,\u0027 he explained.         Ol\u0027 Blue Eyes: The iconic actress had on-screen magic in Young at Heart in 1965 with Frank SinatraDoris married second husband, George Weidler, a saxophonist, when she was 22. They lived in a trailer park and the marriage lasted just eight months. It was significant chiefly for Weidler introducing her to Christian Science — a faith notorious for hostility to modern medicine and its insistence that believers should heal themselves through prayer.Day would say of Weidler: \u0027We had a strong physical attraction for each other, but I didn\u0027t realise that it takes much more than that to make a marriage work.\u0027Even after they split up, they would occasionally reunite for bouts of passionate sex — behaviour that could not be more different from her screen persona and which fulfilled a need she never denied she had for physical relationships.She was also rumoured to have had an affair with Bob Hope — who she met frequently because Hope\u0027s musical director Les Brown was Doris\u0027s bandleader. Hope nicknamed her \u0027Jut Butt\u0027, explaining: \u0027You could play bridge on her ass.\u0027         Co-stars such as Kirk Douglas were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027Without any acting experience, Doris got her big Hollywood break when director Michael Curtiz — looking for an \u0027All-American Girl\u0027 —- cast her in the 1948 romantic comedy musical It\u0027s Magic.He spent most of the time during her screen test wiping away her tears. It was Curtiz who dubbed Day \u0027Miss Lachrymose\u0027 for her uncanny ability to cry on demand. Equally useful was her ability to memorise a script after reading it just once. The film instantly established Doris as a star at 26 and also set in stone — as far as Hollywood publicists were concerned — her image as squeaky clean. Co-stars were amazed by her innocent frankness, wondering as they chatted over lunch if she was really being herself or \u0027in character\u0027.Doris often played singers and hated lip-syncing so she usually sang live on the set.In 1951, aged 29, she married third husband Marty Melcher, a pushy, greedy movie producer who insisted on having a cut in the proceeds from all her future films. He was loathed in Hollywood, where he was known as \u0027Mr Day\u0027 for continually interfering in her career, making impossible demands that were usually for himself rather than her.He pressured her into making various films she had no interest in making, and turning down parts —such as the \u0027older woman\u0027 in The Graduate, that she wanted.         Doris, pictured with co-star Ronald Reagan, never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbolThey fought at work and in their private life. After he followed her into Christian Science, she complained bitterly that the faith became more important to him than their marriage.Christian Science almost proved the death of Doris while she was shooting the 1956 film Julie.Because of their shared religious faith, Melcher refused to let her see a doctor for weeks after she started haemorrhaging for what turned out to be an intestinal tumour.Eventually, she did see a doctor and had to have a hysterectomy. Decades later, Day — who returned to Christian Science in later life — would alarm friends concerned by her increasing frailty by baulking at taking even an aspirin.She left Melcher at least once but confided to friends that she needed —more than he did — the sexual side of their marriage. The star only learned Melcher had swindled her out of her £15 million fortune — leaving with her with debts of around £350,000 — after he died in 1968. He had also signed her up to a five-year contract for a TV series, The Doris Day Show, that she\u0027d known nothing about — although she accepted the part and it became a huge hit.Doris was charged with fraudulently trying to evade income tax and the allegation was only thrown out of court when she proved she\u0027d known nothing about what her husband had been up to.In the end she had a nervous breakdown — one symptom of which was when she ed fully clothed into a friend\u0027s swimming pool — but she eventually won $22 million (£17 million) in damages from Melcher\u0027s attorney and other associates who had mismanaged her money.In 1976, she married for the fourth time, to restaurateur Barry Comden. This time, Day studiously kept their marriage out of the limelight, not even mentioning him in her Who\u0027s Who entries, let alone allowing him to be photographed with her. However, they, too, ended up orcing six years later.All she could say was \u0027it is better that we live apart\u0027 while Comden claimed: \u0027She kicked me out of bed to make room for her animals.\u0027Doris had by then retired from showbusiness and public life, devoting her time to her pets and stray animals. She became known locally as deeply eccentric (although when a newspaper dubbed her a mad \u0027bag lady\u0027, she successfully sued). She would drive her own animal ambulance to a spot where she heard a dog or cat had been run over to care for it, and would appear in supermarkets counting out her discount coupons as she loaded up on pet supplies.She opened an animal hospital and turned her huge home over to her pets, serving them gourmet food and tucking dozens of cats and dogs into specially-made beds at night. Many dogs would pile on to her own kingsize bed.Doris never felt comfortable being a Hollywood superstar or a sex symbol. James Garner, who co-starred with her in two films, once described her as \u0027a very sexy lady who doesn\u0027t know how sexy she is\u0027.She largely cut herself off from her old life, not even attending her son\u0027s funeral when he died of cancer in 2004. Staff who looked after her complained she could be miserly and demanding, not even giving a former PA who broke a front tooth opening a pack of food the money to go to the dentist.In her later years, all but a handful of her smaller pets had to go as her carers grew terrified one might knock her over and kill her.The only fellow star with whom she stayed closely in touch was Rock Hudson. She claimed she loved him, although his homosexuality would have put paid to any romance. When she launched her last TV show — about dogs — in 1985, Hudson was at the press conference.She was stunned by his shattered physical appearance but, having no idea he had Aids, Doris reassured everyone he just had flu. Hudson died soon afterwards.The star once nicknamed The Virgin Queen for the purity of her roles went into hiding for weeks, spending most of the time doing what she always did so well: crying."},{"url":null,"title":"The Queens Dame Helen Mirren 73 reveals feelings insecurity surrounded stars","story":"Share this article Dame Helen said she is often left feeling insecure as she is surrounded by \u0027extraordinary people\u0027 in her working life. \u0027What always comes up in my head is that \u0027I\u0027m boring, I\u0027m stupid, I\u0027m not exciting enough\u0027,\u0027 she explained.\u0027Sometimes I lock myself in the loo to give myself a talking to: you can do it Helen, don\u0027t worry, you can do it!\u0027 said Dame Helen.

Eventually Jeremy Kyle came in and introduced himself.\u0027He came across as the nicest guy in the world.

I didn\u0027t like that. It was so patronising and I felt like walking off straight away.\u0027He heard what I had to say and just kept calling me a liar. Whatever I said, he would twist it to mean something else and I was getting so frustrated.\u0027Then Jennifer came in and started telling more lies about me and then they brought in Larry.\u0027Now he is not an aggressive man but they had wound him up and told him to walk over to me pointing his finger and calling me a liar.\u0027I could not take it.

His temper loss meant he was stripped of his Security Industry licence so lost his job.He then applied to be a bus driver but despite passing the practical and theory tests, was told his criminal record meant he was unsafe to work with the public.The same thing happened when he applied for a taxi licence.Mr Stanforth, who has worked in a warehouse since, added: \u0027The effect it had on my life was very bad indeed. It cost me my job and my chance at doing two other jobs I had in mind.\u0027Jeremy Kyle moulds people and gets into their heads.

He simply pours petrol on any situation and sits back and watches the flames.\u0027I feel very sorry for the family and friends of the man who has taken his own life and if it is proven that he did what he did because of the show then Kyle and his producers should be held responsible.\u0027I don\u0027t think it should continue.

Photograph: GettyCatholic schools want key preparations for sacraments such as Confirmation and Communion to take place outside the classroom, according to the findings of a survey by the Archdiocese of Dublin.Instead, there is a strong demand for parents and local parishes to play a much greater role in preparing children for sacraments.The findings are contained in a sacraments review group survey of 1,800 school principals, teachers, parents, parishioners, clergy and parish workers in the archdiocese, which covers Dublin and Wicklow and parts of Kildare, Carlow, Laois and Wexford.The responses are to be discussed in parishes over the coming weeks to determine how they can be acted upon.Potential changes flowing from the survey could result in an “opt in” approach to Confirmation and Communion in schools, with the bulk of preparation taking place outside school hours. This type of approach is common in multi-denominational schools.Social occasionsThe review group was established late last year by Archbishop Diarmuid Martin following concern that sacraments risked being turned into “social occasions” rather than moments of faith.A spokeswoman for the archdiocese said a strong pattern in the responses is a desire for change “across the board”.“Ireland is unique in its dependence on schools in preparing for and celebrating the sacraments,” she said.“Parishes are becoming more involved and there are some efforts to involve parents more. But in the survey, all express dissatisfaction that it is still largely a school event. Schools themselves feel that they are still working in a vacuum.“All the voices in the survey are asking for more movement in the direction of parent and parish responsibility.“All are saying that passing on the faith is primarily the responsibility of the home, with the support of the parish as well as the school.”She said a big challenge will be how to “action” these findings.“It seems to be about a significant shift of focus, from the current setup where schools engage with children to a new setup where parishes engage with parents,” she said.“At the heart of what has to be figured out, the survey suggests, is how to relate to parents who are coming from different places.”The survey, for example, highlights the contrasts between parents who are churchgoers, others who are not churchgoers but profess to have faith, along with others who see sacraments as family milestones with no faith dimension.The survey did not explore the broader area of religious education and faith formation in schools.Catholic schools are entitled to set aside up to 30 minutes of the school day for faith formation.‘Opt in’ approachHowever, many teachers say preparation for Communion and Confirmation can take much longer.Speaking to The  earlier this year, Archbishop Martin said the archdiocese has been working out how to place a greater emphasis on opting into the sacraments.“For instance this year everybody who wanted to be confirmed had to write, make a formal application addressed to me, again to emphasise that Confirmation isn’t a school subject, it’s a faith subject.”The “opt in” approach for sacramental preparation in multi-denominational schools has been operating for many years and typically involves faith formation classes outside regular school hours.Chief executive of Educate Together Paul Rowe said up to 50 per cent of children who attend their schools self-identify as Catholic and attend faith formation classes outside schools hours.He said the feedback he has received from clergy is that it is leading to greater engagement in the parish and stronger faith formation.“We are not anti-religion by any means – we respect the identity of all children – and we facilitate groups of parents to bring in a catechist after school.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3892397.1557859595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"parents leaving it to schools to prepare children for sacraments","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA survey  reveals a strong demand for parents and local parishes to play a much greater role in preparing children for sacraments. Photograph: Getty ImagesIreland is unique in its dependence on schools in preparing for the sacraments. And, as any primary school teacher will tell you, preparation for Communion or Confirmation isn’t just a one-day affair. There is response learning, singing, church visits, procession practice, wardrobe fittings and photoshoots. All of this takes far more than the 30 minutes designated daily for religious education in the national curriculum.Then there’s the wider question of whether the sacraments are at risk of becoming a social rather than a religious event. Many teachers say they have noticed a deterioration in children’s religious knowledge over the years. Some talk of how they end up having to re-teach students how to receive Communion in their Confirmation year.One recalls a recent First Holy Communion ceremony where the amused congregation were unaware of when to sit, stand or kneel at any point during the Mass.It’s clear that many parents are not engaging with church practices – though they expect it of their schools.Changing fastSociety, generally, is also changing fast: more than a third of marriages are civil rather then religious, while census figures indicate that about a fifth of families of parenting age describe themselves as non-religious. Yet, we have a primary education system where 90 per cent of schools remain under the control of the Catholic Church.It is against this backdrop that Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin last year announced plans to consult teachers, parents and parish personnel to “improve the preparation and celebration of the sacraments”.Sacraments, he said, were not just “conveyor belts” or “social occasions” but “they are fundamentally moments of faith”.The result – based on a survey of 1,800 school principals, teachers, parents, parishioners, clergy and parish workers in the archdiocese – reveals a strong demand for parents and local parishes to play a much greater role in preparing children for sacraments. All are saying that passing on faith is primarily the responsibility of the home, with the support of the parish – as well as the school.The archdiocese says it is to hold meetings with parishes shortly to reflect on these findings.Speaking to The  earlier this year, Archbishop Martin said schools in general felt religious formation should be outside schools and “we’re working on that”.“For instance, this year everybody who wanted to be confirmed had to write, make a formal application addressed to me, again to emphasise that Confirmation isn’t a school subject, it’s a faith subject,” he said.‘Opt-in’ systemOne obvious solution is to do what many multi-denominational schools have been doing for years: establish an “opt-in” system of sacramental preparation. This can involve classes which take place outside school hours either in the school premises or in local parish facilities. While it might end up in fewer children completing the sacraments, from the church’s point of view it could result in a higher proportion of more committed Catholics.Another approach may involve parish programmes which aim to boost parental involvement by encouraging them to bring their children to Mass with them in the months leading up to Communion or Confirmation.Taking sacramental preparation out of the school day, however, is unlikely to be the end of the debate over religion in the education system. While at present up to half an hour of each primary school day is allocated to religious education, a survey by the Irish Primary Principals’ Network found that the vast majority of principals felt less time should be spent on teaching religion in the classroom and more on subjects such as maths, English and physical education.This, no doubt, will be a debate for another day."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3892506.1557864915!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"hse must start living within budget says new boss","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPaul Reid has sought an immediate review of ‘actions and timelines to bring about a financial break-even’ situation. Photograph: Cyril ByrneNew HSE director general Paul Reid has said the health service will no longer spend money it does not have and breaching budgets “can no longer be considered an option”.In a strongly worded memo to his senior management team on his first day in the job on Tuesday, Mr Reid sought an immediate review of “actions and timelines to bring about a financial break-even” situation. This should be presented to him by close of business on Friday, May 24th.He suggested that where the HSE faced urgent demands that would lead to it incurring further costs, one of the options that should be looked at was cutting back on other, lower-priority services.Mr Reid said: “We must deliver a financial break-even in 2019, while prioritising the safety of those services that can be delivered within our budget”. This would “build credibility and confidence” so that the health service would secure a sustained and additional investment over the next five to 10 years, he said.Mr Reid told senior managers they would be held to account for their role in securing a financial break-even position while prioritising the safety of the services that the HSE delivered.The HSE is understood to have recorded a financial overrun of more than €38 million in the first two months of the year, with further losses incurred in March following on from a €600 million deficit in 2018. It received a record €16.05 billion for this year.‘Stark warning’Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe recently gave a “stark warning” to Cabinet colleagues about the need to control spending. And last Friday the Minister for Health Simon Harris said the health service had to live within its budget and there could not be a “runaway train” where inidual health managers were deciding on the numbers to employ.In his memo to each member of the HSE leadership team, each hospital group chief executive and each community healthcare organisation chief officer, Mr Reid said that where the HSE was faced with urgent demands that would lead to it incurring further costs, other options had to be considered, including reducing costs and waste so more services could be provided from the current budget providing less of a lower-priority service to free up the budget for the urgent demand and ensuring those most in need of services benefit from the service level the budget will support.He said he would sit down with managers towards the end of May to look at their plans to bring about financial break-even in the organisation. His chief financial officer would also set out a number of “at-risk areas” for their immediate consideration and action.“Following this, we can then engage with the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure to ensure these plans are understood and supported.”Proactive managementMr Reid said no inidual health service manager had “the sole authority to make or avoid decisions that will lead to a financial overrun in 2019, or in 2020”.“However, for the absolute avoidance of doubt, I expect all senior managers in the health service, including clinical managers, to manage and to control spend within budgets. That means managing risks proactively and effectively, as close as practical to the level at which they arise. I will consider it an absolute failure of management, and of inidual managers, if the primary net effect of good disciplines of financial management is that multiple problems and risks are simply transferred upwards to the next layer of management and ultimately arrive at my desk.”The new director general of the HSE also said the executive needed to clearly communicate “the reality that there is no recruitment embargo or moratorium in the health service nor is there a ban on agency or overtime.”However, he said there was a priority requirement for all services to maintain, or get to, an affordable staffing level that was sustainable in 2019 and 2020, while also prioritising the delivery of safe services."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Documents given by FAI to Office of Director of Corporate Enforcement have now been provided to High courtExtensive independent audit will get underway in the coming daysError in cost-benefit analyses by PwC found only in weeks before the decision to proceedManagers will be held to account to break even, says Paul Reid in first full day in jobGreater role for parishes and parents in preparing children for the religious rites of passageInterviews for top Northern Ireland policing post to succeed George Hamilton next weekDentists training to become specialists forced abroad, many never to return, says RCSIClose links to online services and mobile phones highlighted in study for BT IrelandInquiry continues into claims of Virgin Mary appearancesStudy claims glucosamine associated with lower incidence of cardiovascular diseasePaul Reid departed to become director general of the Health Service ExecutiveFour weeks extra unpaid parental leave from September with four more to be added in 2020Review of more than 46,000 tests found 11 patients suffered delayed cancer diagnosisClaimants, abused in State schools, must show abuser was the subject of a previous complaintLen McCluskey says Labour Party in Ireland has \u0026lsquoutterly lost its way\u0026rsquoWoman claims she was headbutted multiple times by the animal on Downpatrick HeadYouth Work Ireland says current laws allow schools to omit key aspects of curriculum"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3892369.1557858795!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"value reports on broadband plan overstated operator costs by 1bn","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Communications Richard Bruton is among the advocates for the broadband plan. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe Major value-for-money reports on the National Broadband Plan consistently overestimated by €1 billion costs facing the operator.The error in the cost-benefit analyses carried out by PwC was discovered only in the weeks before the Government decided to proceed with the plan.The mistaken figure, which overestimated the costs to the operator by €1.079 billion, was discovered between February and April.That error, coupled with repeated concerns expressed about the robustness and basis of the study, led the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform (DPER) to conclude the cost-benefit analysis was not credible.The €1 billion error is disclosed in the final lengthy submission the department made to Government opposing the project.Following concerns expressed by senior department officials that the benefits of the project had been overstated in the PwC cost-benefit analysis, the benefit was reduced by €1.13 billion.However, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform submission then disclosed the error which overstated the costs of the project by €1 billion.“This discovered reduction in costs fortuitously compensates for the reductions in benefits arising from our observations on the previous version of the CBA“In summary, the CBA is not credible and it is questionable whether it is consistent with the public spending code.”Communications responseWhen contacted, PwC said it did not comment on matters relating to its client affairs. A spokeswoman for the Department of Communications said: “The internal workings of draft CBA models is a matter for which has provided all the necessary assurances to the department that the final CBA provided to DPER is accurate for all known costs and benefits allowed or under the public spending code and is fully compliant with the code.”A number of cost-benefit analysis draft reports had been prepared for the Department of Communications, all of which gave a positive assessment of the project, concluding that the value of the benefits from the project would outweigh the costs of the State investment, which will amount to almost €3 billion, including VAT and contingencies.In all of its submissions during the cost-benefit analysis process, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform was highly sceptical of the positive conclusions and argued it had significantly overestimated the benefits.“(If our) concerns regarding the robustness of the CBA were taken on board, it is more likely to result in a negative net present value (for the project),” it stated in February.The mistake in operational costs had the effect of increasing the benefit because they were lower. But even when the €1 billion downward adjustment of costs was taken into account, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform believed the benefit from the broadband plan would be negative.The cost-benefit analysis has been used as justification for the cost by the project’s proponents, including Minister for Communications Richard Bruton and former minister Denis Naughten. Both have cited a 30 per cent benefit over costs, although the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform submission has contested that conclusion. It contended the finding should be negative.Defenders of the analysis maintain it has taken a “conservative view” of future benefits, including no assumptions of increases in the numbers working remotely, or of increases of white-collar workers living in, and working from, these rural areas."},{"url":null,"title":"local","story":"Total of 62 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 34-seat constituencyTotal of 49 candidates running in 20-seat constituencyTotal of 66 candidates running in 32-seat constituencyTotal of 79 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 35 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 36 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 63 candidates running in 30-seat constituencyTotal of 60 candidates running in 29-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 92 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 32 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 39 candidates running in 19-seat constituencyTotal of 44 candidates running in 24-seat constituencyTotal of 90 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 62 candidates running in 33-seat constituencyTotal of 78 candidates running in 39-seat constituencyTotal of 47 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyTotal of 89 candidates running in 40-seat constituencyTotal of 150 candidates running in 63-seat constituencyTotal of 85 candidates running in 37-seat constituencyTotal of 107 candidates running in 55-seat constituencyTotal of 82 candidates running in 31-seat constituencyTotal of 51 candidates running in 28-seat constituencyTotal of 33 candidates running in 18-seat constituency31 candidates running in 18-seat constituencyBreakdown of latest  poll numbers indicates growing support for both parties in DublinMore than 500 female candidates are contesting the local elections, many of them under 35Gap in backing for Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil smallest in 2\u0026frac12 years while Sinn F\u0026eacutein also slipsBad news for Taoiseach Leo Varadkar whose personal satisfaction rating continues to fallVoters who care about the right to life must send a message to smug pro-choice partiesCourt records show Nial Ring has been defendant in 16 sets of High Court proceedings since 2004Almost 2,000 candidates will contest 949 seats in 31 city and county councilsCandidate \u0026lsquoconfused\u0026rsquo by party statement after campaigning throughout review processA significant portion of the electorate is making a plea for a move from polarised to a more accommodating form of politicsGreens and People Before Profit also make gains in local electionsKisyombe\u0026rsquos candidacy sparked controversy following backstory inconsistenciesConservatives lose more than 1,100 seats in local elections as Labour loses more than 100 seatsDUP\u0026rsquos first openly gay candidate elected to Newtownabbey Borough CouncilIrreverent campaign asked people to vote all the way down the ballot in PR-STV electionTalks designed to restore devolution set to begin next Tuesday after Thursday\u0026rsquos pollAlison Bennington is party candidate for the Glengormley urban area of Newtownabbey Borough CouncilParty has launched 111 candidates for the local elections, and three candidates for the European electionsExtended licensing hours for serving alcohol also considered as part of local election planVoters outside the capital must use manual processPosters are an important part of our electoral and democratic process, says KinsellaPoliticians risk \u0026euro150 fine per early election posterThe upcoming local and European elections are powerful platforms for the marginalised to make their voices heardCommittee says message to local and European candidates had been \u0026lsquomisunderstood\u0026rsquoBusConnects reforms would create 230km of bus lanes along 16 traffic corridorsWe need to establish why more immigrants don\u0026rsquot participate in politics, says one candidateCouncillor-migrant internship scheme seeks to encourage greater migrant involvementInstagram helps politicians present a more rounded image.

Checkmate. Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsHow is a Labour leader supposed to vehemently oppose the Government’s broadband project when the silken words of an illustrious predecessor are used to undermine his case? To make matters worse, the actions of yet another party stalwart are then thrown in his face to further dent the body of his argument.Brendan Howlin is adamant the Government has made the wrong choice on broadband. On Tuesday, he marshalled his thoughts on the issue and presented them in the Dáil to the Taoiseach. As a man who likes to remind erstwhile colleagues he was once the minister for public expenditure in a Fine Gael administration and there isn’t much they can tell him about overseeing major projects, Brendan is deeply suspicious of this new deal.He made a persuasive case for State ownership of the project.Until Leo Varadkar nipped in and tried to sabotage him by heaping praise on the Labour party while approvingly invoking the names of former leader Pat Rabbitte and former minister Alex White to bolster his claim that his plan is the only way to go.The Taoiseach has full confidence in his Government’s broadband strategy and is keen to do his utmost to see it implemented, even if the big idea for the whole thing came from the Labour party in the first place.“I really feel that this project is one that you as a party should be proud of,” he informed a stunned-looking Labour leader, shamelessly turning on the treacle.“Impassioned” isn’t normally a word you type alongside this Taoiseach’s name. Maybe it was the alarming fall in his popularity rating in Saturday’s opinion poll which compelled him to inject some proper enthusiasm into his contribution at Leaders’ Questions, as opposed to the default loftiness.There were echoes of 1991 when Fianna Fáil’s Gerry Collins famously pleaded with Albert Reynolds not to challenge Charlie Haughey for the party leadership.“Don’t do it, Micheál. Don’t burst up the broadband!”The plan will be debated in the weeks to come.“The one thing I would just ask of the Opposition parties here – I ask this sincerely of the main Opposition party but of the others too – I would appeal to you to not rule out supporting the national broadband plan just yet.”Listen to the arguments and consider them, Leo urged TDs, pleading with them not to take broadband “back to square one”.Going back to square one wasn’t Brendan Howlin’s biggest concern. He was more worried about going back to 1999 and the disastrous privatisation of Telecom Éireann. A big problem today with extending the broadband network is that the “poles and ducts” needed to carry the fibre cables are now in private ownership.“Renationalise Eircom. Simple,” said Richard Boyd Barrett, suggesting a way for Ireland to get all its broadband ducts in a row.Carefully consideredInstead of ignoring the Socialist’s suggestion, as would be expected of true-blue Varadkar, he revealed this option had been carefully considered but was ruled out for cost reasons.Here’s a thought: If a dyed-in-the wool Fine Gael Government can ideologically tolerate renationalising a major private utility, might it now similarly contemplate rebuilding State-funded housing?Despite all Leo’s fervent requests, the Opposition remained unconvinced. “What is the justification or the logic of the Taoiseach’s argument for a private monopoly to own the rural broadband network in perpetuity?” wondered Howlin. Instead of learning the harsh lesson of Telecom Éireann, he said the Government now intends to repeat history and “privatise the next generation of telecommunications”.Brendan knows his stuff and he told the Dáil the EU would sanction a State-backed broadband system, even at this late stage. “I assure the Taoiseach that our plans would deliver much better value to the taxpayers of this country.”He did a bit of pleading of his own.“I invite you, Taoiseach, to read the judgement in the Croatia case. They are providing broadband and it’s just so analogous to what we are doing here,” he declared, to general bafflement.That was too much to take on board when Leo was getting slightly emotional over the provision of broadband while admitting that a Fine Gael Government has actually considered renationalising the phone network.Mercy“That’s the alternative. It’s not a good one. We did think about it. We thought about all of the alternatives for months and months and months. This is the best option on the table. This is right for Ireland and this is right for rural Ireland,” he cried, before throwing himself at the mercy of the opposition again.“Two weeks before the elections,” shrugged Michael Healy-Rae, unmoved.“I really appeal to everyone in this House to take a bit of time like we did. Take a few months to see if the alternatives really stack up and don’t rule out supporting it just yet,” persevered Leo. “We can sign this, we can make this happen.”“Will it be worth a lot of seats?” asked Healy-Rae, twice.“If we don’t sign this contract, it may never happen.”Visions of Enda Kenny and an unsuccessful election campaign were awakened. “Sign the contract!” Enda urged the electorate. “Sign the contract!” They didn’t.One final push for doubtin’ Howlin.“Deputy, you may not agree but I actually see this as a Labour project, as well as a project of this Government, because your party and your ministers were at the centre of making this project happen and making it a reality,” the Taoiseach said, sounding a little desperate by now. Former Labour leader Pat Rabbitte made the decision in 2012.“And I note that in his article this weekend in the Sunday Business Post that he supports the Government decision to go ahead with this.”‘Offstage noise’Indeed he did. “When the offstage noise abates, it will be acknowledged that this is the best solution,” is how Pat ended a column which must have brightened Leo’s Sunday.Brendan looked a bit sour about this.But the Taoiseach wasn’t finished, pointing out that Rabbitte’s successor in communications, “Alex White, of your own party”, helped their decision by whittling down the options from five to two. The Government chose one of them.Next up was Independent TD for Galway West Catherine Connolly, who reminded everyone of the fact that the Dáil declared a climate change emergency and bio-ersity emergency last Thursday. There didn’t seem half as much concern about that.Largely “a symbolic gesture”, said Leo. Although “symbols and gestures matter”.We’re all going to die, but at least we’ll have the broadband."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3892531.1557867771!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no evidence of progress in tory labour brexit talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIf the British prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn, above, cannot agree on a common position, the government’s Plan B is to seek Labour’s engagement with a process of ‘definitive votes’. Photograph: Ben BirchallPA Wire Theresa May’s announcement last night that she will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) early next month comes despite no evidence of progress in talks between her government and Labour. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe prime minister agreed with Jeremy Corbyn last night to continue the talks but the results of next week’s European Parliament elections are likely to make an agreement more difficult to achieve.\u0026nbspNigel Farage’s Brexit Party is on course to swallow up most of the traditional Conservative vote and a catastrophic result will stiffen the spine of Tory Brexiteers in resisting compromise. Labour is losing support to the Liberal Democrats and Greens, both of which are clearly committed to a second referendum on Brexit, a position favoured by many Labour MPs but not fully endorsed by the party leadership. Labour MPs, especially in London and the southeast, will be more reluctant than ever after the elections to vote for any deal that does not include a confirmatory referendum.Exhaustive voteIf the two sides cannot agree on a common position, the government’s Plan B is to seek Labour’s engagement with a process of “definitive votes”. This would see a number of Brexit options put to an exhaustive vote under the Alternative Vote (AV) or Single Transferable Vote (STV). There is little reason to believe, however, that any option to emerge as the winner from such a process could command a majority in the House of Commons.1922 Committee chairman Graham Brady is planning to table an amendment to the WAB that would put into British law a commitment to ensure that “alternative arrangements” for the Border are in place before Britain’s post-Brexit transition period ends. Under the proposal, the Northern Ireland backstop would remain part of the withdrawal agreement but the alternative arrangements would ensure that it is never activated.ScepticalBrussels and Dublin are sceptical but senior EU and Irish sources acknowledge privately that if the wording of Brady’s amendment does not contradict any commitment Britain makes in the withdrawal agreement, it would not be seen as an act of bad faith or non-ratification of the agreement.The prime minister’s announcement of a timetable for the WAB, which she says must pass all its stages before the summer recess in late July, comes two days before she is due to meet the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee. The backbenchers want her to outline a timetable for her own departure from Downing Street and the legislative plan for the WAB could offer a blueprint.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

After a 15 minute surgery, the vast majority of patients will regain their sight.However barriers to treatment are significant. In many corners of the globe, the £28 operation represents a small fortune – if it is offered at all in local hospitals.  The coordinated approach to community health (Catch) programme, part-funded by the UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), has sought to close treatment gaps by tapping into existing networks established to eradicate trachoma.“Avoidable blindness could triple by 2050 unless efforts to improve eye health-care are stepped up across the world,” Moses Chege, Sightsavers project director for Catch, told The .Disease of thorns | The battle to eliminate trachoma“Catch used innovative ways of improving this eye health-care, by piggybacking on trachoma camps to identify and treat people with other conditions,” he added.The fight against the so-called “disease of thorns” – which turns eyelashes against the globe of the eye and slowly blinds – has been ongoing for decades. Trachoma screening camps established by organisations such as Sightsavers across East Africa, where the disease was endemic, have had considerable success.But thousands of those who went in search of help did not receive treatment, as the trachoma camps were not equipped to tackle the eye conditions they were suffering from.The £5 million Catch programme, funded through the UK government’s aid match scheme, has addressed these gaps in eye care.Between 2014 and 2018, more than 64,600 cases of bacterial conjunctivitis were treated and 28,400 pairs of glasses were provided within the camps.Gladys Atto with patient Loumo Mariam, after performing sight-saving surgeryA further 21,000 people with cataracts who had surgery, having been provided with transport to their nearest hospital facility.“My life has totally changed,” said Loumo Mariam, who had cataract operation last year. “I can now move, look for water, for food. They will say I was half dead, but now I have risen back to life.”In her 60s, Loumo is from a small village in north-west Uganda. After a diagnosis at a trachoma camp in her village she was taken to hospital, completing the hours-long journey with 16 other patients.Her surgery was completed by Gladys Atto, a new ophthalmologist. It costs in the region of £20,000 to train a specialist eye doctor, and Dr Atto is one of 30 funded by Catch.Gladys Atto performing a cataract operation at at Moroto Regional Referral Hospital, North UgandaSome 650 existing health workers also received additional training in eye care - skills desperately required.The 30-year-old can perform as many as 30 cataract operations each day.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleBut as targets to eliminate trachoma are neared and the screening camps no longer required, the Catch project will have to adapt again. Sightsavers say the lessons learned will play a major part in further improving eye care in some of the world’s most remote communities.“It has also strengthened health systems so that this important work can continue,” he added.Sightsavers are currently raising funds for the \u0027End is in Sight\u0027 appeal.

His e went 52 feet (16 meters) lower than the previous deepest descent in the trench in 1960.Mr Vescovo found undiscovered species as he visited places no human had gone before. On one occasion he spent four hours on the floor of the trench, viewing sea life ranging from shrimp-like anthropods with long legs and antennae to translucent sea pigs similar to a sea cucumber.He also saw angular metal or plastic objects, one with writing on it.It was very disappointing to see obvious human contamination of the deepest point in the ocean, Mr Vescovo told Reuters.An object described as \u0026#34manmade\u0026#34 is illuminated at top right by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchPlastic waste has reached epidemic proportions in the world\u0027s oceans with an estimated 100 million tonnes dumped there to date, according to the United Nations. Scientists have found large amounts of micro plastic in the guts of deep-dwelling ocean mammals like whales.A report published on Tuesday, one of the first to document the impact of discarded plastic on the health of the poorest people in the world, estimates that between 400,000 and one million people die every year because of diseases and accidents linked to poorly managed waste in developing countries.Mr Vescovo hoped his discovery of rubbish in the Mariana Trench would raise awareness about dumping in the oceans and pressure governments to better enforce existing regulations, or put new ones in place.It\u0027s not a big garbage collection pool, even though it\u0027s treated as such, Mr Vescovo said of the worlds\u0027 oceans.Undersea explorer Victor Vescovo pilots the submarine DSV Limiting Factor in the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchHis discovery comes a year after a study revealed how human activities were affecting deep-sea ecosystems.Scientists from the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology in Yokosuka found a plastic bag while exploring the deep trench. Other waste found by the probe include metal, rubber, fishing gear, glass and various other man-made items.In the last three weeks, the expedition has made four es in the Mariana Trench in his submarine, DSV Limiting Factor, collecting biological and rock samples.Sea creatures swim around a part of a submersible lander, illuminated by the light of the submarine DSV Limiting Factor on the floor of the Pacific Ocean\u0026#39s Mariana TrenchIt was the third time humans have ed to the deepest point in the ocean, known as Challenger Deep.

With almost 250,000 e-scooters sold in France last year - a 129 per cent increase compared with 2017 -  doctors also warn that they are facing a surge in accidents resulting from falls.The problem has become acute in Paris where the rental fleet is estimated at 15,000 and growing fast. Users often fail to wear helmets despite many e-scooters reaching speeds of 37mph. One was even recently filmed at 53mph on a motorway near Paris.A total of 284 people were injured and five killed in accidents involving scooters in 2017, the last year for which full figures are available. Élisabeth Borne, the French transport minister, said that their sudden arrival had been a “bit anarchic” and that they had brought “the law of the jungle” to French streets.The government intends to outlaw riding an e-scooter on a pavement from September, with a fine of €135 for infringements. E-scooters will be authorised only in bicycle lanes and on minor roads, with a maximum authorised speed of 15mph and a fine of up to €1,500 for exceeding the limit.In the meantime, transport deputies of Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo this week signed a charter with 10 e-scooter operators to “regulate scooter use”.There are an estimated 15,000 e-scooters in Paris but that could grow to 40,000 within months which would be \u0026#34intolerable\u0026#34 says the town hallChristophe Najdovski, transport deputy, said the capital was saturated. “If we do nothing, in the next few months, we’ll have 30,000 or 40,000 scooters. It’s not tolerable, he said.“We put the public space at (operators’) disposal. In return, we hope operators will find solutions in terms of traffic and parking,” he added.If self-regulation failed, however, the municipality would simply ban e-scooters until the autumn law is enacted, he said.The charter’s main aim is to get operators do their utmost to ensure that the scooters don\u0027t clutter pavement and to pass on the message to customers. The town hall will tow away any scooters that are considered to be blocking passages and fine operators around €100 to retrieve each.If a complaint is made, operators have 12 hours to act or pay up. It is their responsibility to avoid the over-concentration of scooters in one place. To ensure this, staff who pick them up must place them in areas where they don\u0027t cause trouble.They must also share their data so the town hall can map out activity. The municipality will provide 500 dedicated parking spaces. Scooters must be insured, and users must sign a declaration that they are not underage. Customer service must be available in French.As the French grapple with the e-scooter craze, the UK government is mulling an end to the ban on using e-scooters, Segways and hoverboards on roads and pavements.Please review our commenting policyLawyers risk hypocrisy in #MeToo scandal as third of women in profession are sexually harassed Comment: Our builders’ new-found taste for fancy teas only compounds our middle-class angst‘Attenborough effect’ sparks rise in  award-winning clean beaches in BritainComment: Britain needs a leader, and Esther McVey is the woman for meAt least 1.3 million pensioners have no free care home beds in their areaMiles Jupp quits The News Quiz on Radio 4 New law will stop Armed Forces veterans being prosecuted for historical offencesComment: The Conservative Party is trapped in a political vacuum of its own makingSudan army rulers, protesters agree on three-year transition periodMonet masterpiece \u0026#39Meules\u0026#39 sets record with £86m sale at auction in New YorkEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Donald Trump Jr agrees to Senate committee interview as part of Russia probeEurovision 2019: semi-final one, recap: Australia\u0026#39s Kate Miller-Heidke soars amidst the competition\u0026#39s dregsSocial media trolls are as bad as drink drivers, says Government\u0026#39s Suicide Prevention MinisterWorld should follow UK\u0026#39s lead by creating statutory duty of care protect people from online harms, says Theresa MayMike Pompeo warns Russia not to meddle in 2020 US electionJoint supplements could reduce the chance of early heart death by a fifthYears and Years, episode 1, review: Russell T Davies brews up an anxious concoction of big issues and future fearsTwenty-four hours with Nigel Farage: \u0026#39I won\u0026#39t be rolled over.

The identity of the winner was not revealed.The winning bid shatters the previous record for the highest sum ever paid for a work by Monet, signalling the enduring value and popularity of the French impressionist master the bid is also the record for any impressionist work of art, Sotheby\u0027s said.Claude Monet\u0026#39s Meules, a masterpiece from his Haystacks SeriesDescribed as the most glorious and effusive work from the Water Lilies artist\u0027s famed Haystacks series, the evocative Meules depicts a row of haystacks casting long shadows in the warm glow of the sun.Monet began work for the series in the mid-1880s, although the major masterpieces focusing on the fleeting nature of natural light were created between 1889 and 1891.Meules was acquired directly from Monet\u0027s dealer in the 1890s by Potter and Bertha Palmer, wealthy Chicago socialites and avid collectors of impressionist works.The piece was among 90 by the French master collected by Mrs Palmer and remained in her possession until her death in 1918.After being handed down through the Palmer family, it was purchased at auction in 1986 for $2.53 million by a private collector.The example is one of four works from the series that remain in private hands.The other 17 examples are in the collections of leading museums around the world.The Scottish National Gallery, the politan Museum of Art, New York, the Musee d\u0027Orsay, Paris and the Art Institute of Chicago have acquired pieces from the series.Please review our commenting policyAt least 1.3 million pensioners have no free care home beds in their areaMiles Jupp quits The News Quiz on Radio 4 Lawyers risk hypocrisy in #MeToo scandal as third of women in profession are sexually harassed Comment: Our builders’ new-found taste for fancy teas only compounds our middle-class angst‘Attenborough effect’ sparks rise in  award-winning clean beaches in BritainComment: Britain needs a leader, and Esther McVey is the woman for meNew law will stop Armed Forces veterans being prosecuted for historical offencesComment: The Conservative Party is trapped in a political vacuum of its own makingSudan army rulers, protesters agree on three-year transition periodEuropean elections 2019: What date does the UK vote - and why are we even taking part?Donald Trump Jr agrees to Senate committee interview as part of Russia probeEurovision 2019: semi-final one, recap: Australia\u0026#39s Kate Miller-Heidke soars amidst the competition\u0026#39s dregsSocial media trolls are as bad as drink drivers, says Government\u0026#39s Suicide Prevention MinisterWorld should follow UK\u0026#39s lead by creating statutory duty of care protect people from online harms, says Theresa MayMike Pompeo warns Russia not to meddle in 2020 US electionJoint supplements could reduce the chance of early heart death by a fifthYears and Years, episode 1, review: Russell T Davies brews up an anxious concoction of big issues and future fearsTwenty-four hours with Nigel Farage: \u0026#39I won\u0026#39t be rolled over.

To solve this, Flexa built an app called Spedn, which allows cryptocurrency holders to make instant payments to merchants that accepts Flexa as a payment provider.The Flexa team has decades of payments experience, and at this point, we believe that the best way for global commerce to become more efficient and accessible is by bringing cryptocurrency to the masses, the company wrote in a blog post last year.By making cryptocurrencies spendable in mainstream commerce, our sincere hope is that we can help bring the full promise of blockchain technologies to people all over the world.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearNo additional hardware or software is needed on the retailers\u0027 side in order to integrate the payments, they only need to allow Flexa to be a new payment provider on their existing systems.For customers, the process of paying is similar to existing digital payment methods like Apple Pay and Google Pay. Once the Spedn app is downloaded, payments can be made by scanning an automatically generated QR code to the payments terminal at the till.One of the other issues facing cryptocurrency in its quest to become a mainstream form of payment is price volatility. Recent positive news in the cryptocurrency space, for example, has seen\u0026nbspthe price of bitcoin shoot up by around $2,000 over the last two days - which Flexa\u0027s\u0026nbspannouncement may well have contributed to.To counter this, Flexa has partnered with New York-based cryptocurrency exchange Gemini so that payments can be made using a so-called stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.Flexa claims the Spedn app will help reduce processing fees and payment fraud (Flexa)Flexa has only\u0026nbspannounced a limited\u0026nbsplist of retailers, which include Whole Foods, Nordstrom and Lowes. However videos shared online also show Starbucks accepting cryptocurrency payments through the app.In total, around 100 merchants are expected to accept cryptocurrency payments through the Flexa app by the end of the year, totalling more than 30,000 stores.Eventually, Flexa wants to make it possible for any shop to accept any cryptocurrency.As\u0026nbspthe Flexa network grows, we hope to show the world just how transformative cryptocurrencies can be for all kinds of payments, not just peer-to-peer transactions, but also retail paumnets, dining and beyond, Flexa\u0027s announcement stated.The world of payments is evolving quickly now, and we believe that Flexa will be a massive part of the shift toward more efficient and more accessible commerce around the globe.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

No jobs cuts are expected prior to that date.Director of Honda UK Jason Smith\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbsp“It is with a heavy heart that today we confirm the closure of Honda’s factory in Swindon. We understand the impact this decision has on our associates, suppliers and the wider community. We are committed to continuing to support them throughout the next phases of the consultation process.”The Japanese carmaker had announced plans in February to leave the site in South Marston near Swindon. It said the change was not as a result of Brexit but because it is shifting focus to electric cars with most demand expected to be in Asia.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersAfter consulting\u0026nbspwith the government and external consultants engaged by the Unite union, closure was deemed to be inevitable.Prime Minister Theresa May’s official spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “Clearly, this is a disappointing decision, despite the best efforts of local MPs, civic and business leaders and the trade unions since Honda’s initial announcement in February. We recognise this is a worrying time for affected employees, their families and businesses in the supply chain.”Business secretary Greg Clark has set up a local taskforce which\u0026nbspaims to ensure that\u0026nbspemployees are able to move on to new skilled employment. That taskforce is due to hold its next meeting next week.Honda is one of a number of car manufacturers to cut back its presence in the UK this year. Nissan said in January that it would build its new X-Trail model in Japan instead of Sunderland, despite earlier reassurances.Ford is planning to offer redundancy to more than 500 staff at its Essex office, while Jaguar Land Rover confirmed in January that it would cut 4,500 jobs from its 40,000-strong UK workforce as it attempts to deal with a sharp drop in demand in China.I can’t blame Honda for leaving, this country keeps letting them downUnite national officer for automotive industries\u0026nbspDes Quinn said he believed there was a case for keeping the plant open and that the government would have provided public funding.“It would have made Honda a global leader in emerging battery technology and in a strong position to exploit the growing global market for electric vehicles in the coming years,” Mr Quinn said.“Instead we have this body blow which is nothing short of a betrayal of the workforce, customers and the wider supply chain which relies on Honda Swindon for work.“Unite can only conclude that Honda is taking a strategic decision to retreat out of Europe in favour of protecting its North American operations and avoiding president Trump’s tariff threat on cars made in Europe.”Honda said it was closing\u0026nbspthe Swindon factory as part of a broader global strategy “in response to changes to the automotive industry”.The company also faces the reality of uncertain tariffs on vehicle exports from the UK after Brexit. Meanwhile, Japan and the EU recently finalised a trade deal that will see tariffs on Japanese vehicles imported into the trading bloc reduced from 10 per cent\u0026nbspto zero.In a statement on Monday, Honda said: “As previously communicated in February, Honda is accelerating its electrification plans, and as a result resources, capabilities and production systems for electrified vehicles will be focused in regions with a high volume of customer demand.“This concludes the first phase of the collective consultation process. The second phase – which includes agreeing associate redundancy packages and identifying the impact on inidual roles up until production ceases in 2021 – will begin immediately.“Honda will also intensify its engagement with the Swindon taskforce set up by secretary of state Greg Clark, in order to work with government and a broad range of stakeholders to mitigate the impact of this decision on the wider community.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

My life\u0027s work is my legacy and I haven\u0027t got a spoilt child to run the business.”He plans to stay involved in the business, but a management board will oversee day-to-day operations, along with a newly set up colleagues\u0027 advisory council and trustees.The colleagues\u0027 advisory council will be chaired by a trustee and will be made up of current staff and will represent their interests and concerns.David Robinson, chairman of Richer Sounds, said: “It\u0027s incredibly exciting times and allows our colleagues to feel even more connected to the company.“They have a real stake in the success of the business and can take pride in knowing that they are shareholders, building for the future.”Mr Richer, who founded the business in 1978 at the age of 19, had long planned to hand control of the firm to staff and had already written the plan into his will, but wanted to ensure he could oversee the transition.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway. Bambi isn’t exactly the most action-packed Disney film around, and it’s hard to imagine many people are getting a kick out of the singalong version to “April Showers”. But is there any bigger shock to the system for a child at the movies than the sudden, ruthless slaughtering of Bambi’s mother?Of the Disney Renaissance offerings, Pocahontas stumbles in its messy handling of history, since turning any interaction between white colonisers and indigenous people into a fluffy romance arguably whitewashes the brutal reality of what happened. But there are plenty of positives to be found, since Pocahontas was such a huge influence in Disney’s later portrayals of strong, independently minded women. The film may be relatively light on story (it’s basically Lady and the Tramp, but there’s an added kidnap element), but who cares, when the film features the hottest party of the entire Disney franchise? It’s true what they say: “Everybody wants to be a cat.” In a way, Robin Hood is the ultimate Disney film of the 1970s. It’s a folksy, low-key entry into the canon that’s all about keeping the peace and spreading good vibes. Just ignore the fact that it recycled several pieces of animation from the likes of Snow White and The Jungle Book.It may not have spawned the same level of craze as Frozen did, but Zootopia doesn’t deserve to become another forgotten Disney film. Although it’s as funny as you’d hope from a film about animals with jobs, it also offers parents an easy entry point to talk to their kids about racism and xenophobia. And that’s something that shouldn’t be taken for granted. Dumbo demonstrates the two gifts of early Disney films. There’s the capacity for moments that are pure and heartwrenching, as seen in “Baby Mine” (a scene that’s almost impossible to watch without welling up). Then there’s the ability to descend into the totally bizarre, as characterised by the downright scary “Pink Elephants on Parade” sequence. Tangled finds fun, humour, and adventure in its reimagining of the Rapunzel tale, but what’s crucial to its success is how it anchors the entire film around a single, showstopping sequence: “I See the Light”, where Rapunzel watches hundreds of paper lanterns float up into the skies. It’s, quite simply, a beautiful piece of filmmaking. 930 22. Princess and the Frog (2009)Disney’s brief return to traditional animation reminded us what had been lost in the switch to 3D animation. There’s a wonderful sense of artistry to how The Princess and the Frog renders New Orleans during the Jazz Age, especially in the Art Deco stylised number “Almost There”. And a Disney princess working hard to make her dreams come true? That’s something to celebrate. Although Cinderella is a central member of the Disney princesses, her film hasn’t aged quite as well as the rest of the early Disney films. There’s an odd amount of time spent on Lucifer the cat, and relatively little time spent at Cinderella’s magical soiree. 1130 20. One Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)Cruella de Vil may have committed attempted puppy murder, but there’s still something irresistibly delightful about her “Patsy from Ab Fab” combination of luxury goods and frightening taste. Only Cruella could answer a simple “How are you?” with the line: Miserable darling, as usual, perfectly wretched.”1230 19. Lady and the Tramp (1955)One of several films on this list containing problematic material, Lady and the Tramp certainly isn’t a faultless film. However, given that the central courtship is between two dogs, the film boasts a surprisingly elegant love story. Not only is there the famous “Bella Notte” scene and its accidental spaghetti kiss, but the crooning Pekingese, voiced by Peggy Lee, is simply sublime.Disney took the straightfoward path to making a hit musical for today: they hired Lin-Manuel Miranda. The Hamilton composer and lyricist is a maestro when it comes to cranking out the hits. Opetaia Foa\u0027i helped create the soundtrack’s South Pacific touches, while Dwayne Johnson even wheeled out some light rapping for his performance as the demigod Maui. Moana tells a culturally specific story with spirit, heart, and humour – more of this in the future please, Disney. The Emperor’s New Groove never quite got the appreciation it deserved when it was first released, largely because, like Lilo \u0026amp Stitch, it’s been tossed aside as another forgettable post-Disney Renaissance entry. Not so fast: though it may not have the epic scale of Mulan or Beauty and the Beast, The Emperor’s New Groove is a funny, endlessly quotable (“Pull the lever, Kronk!”) Disney film that – most importantly – finally let Eartha Kitt voice a Disney villain. It may be every modern parent’s least favourite Disney film, but Frozen is actually pretty great if you’ve not been forced to watch it five times a day, seven days a week. On top of a moving central story about self-acceptance and sisterly love, Idina Menzel’s rendition of “Let it Go” is a showstopper tune that demands to belted at least once at every karaoke night. A flight of fancy that celebrates the power of imagination, JM Barrie’s Peter Pan was always an obvious fit for Disney. The film presents an uplifting and limitless world to younger audiences, while letting the adults pretend miserable things like taxes and orce don’t exist for a precious hour and a bit. Plus, Tinker Bell seems like a vicious gossip and the ideal person to go for a drink with, even if she doesn’t quite speak our language. 1730 14. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)It’s the film that started it all. Although Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs has since been overshadowed by its successors to some degree, it still has its fair share of magical moments. There’s the small army of birds and rodents that come to Snow White’s aid during “Whistle While You Work”, and the Evil Queen, gone full Joan Crawford, delivering her oft misquoted line: “Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all.”A round of applause for John Musker, who had the idea of telling the Greek myth of Hercules through a chorus of gospel singers. They are, without a doubt, the true heroes of this film, thanks to the insanely catchy “Zero to Hero”. That said, Megara’s definitely a close runner-up for the title, since her “I’m a damsel. I’m in distress. I can handle this” routine made her the go-to Disney princess for the cool kids. Let them deny it all they want, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a Nineties kid who hasn’t secretly put “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” on their workout playlist. The whole film, in fact, is a power anthem, while Mulan’s one-woman feminist revolution makes her one of those rare multitasking princesses who can do a lot more than just win over a handsome prince. As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. 130 30. The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)Although the film may feel relatively slight compared to the other titans of animation on this list, there is something so wonderfully zen about this Pooh, filtering the wise words of AA Milne through the slow, thoughtful tones of Sterling Holloway.

As the very last film to be produced by Walt Disney himself, The Jungle Book marked the end of an era for the studio. The film captures the kind of easy charm that made Disney’s work such a huge part of so many childhoods in the first place. As Baloo eases into “The Bear Necessities”, it feels very much like someone’s come to gently pat you on the shoulder and tell you everything’s going to be alright. Aladdin may have plenty of tricks up its sleeve, but it deserves its place in the upper echelons of Disney films purely on the strength of Robin Williams’s performance as Genie. The comedy actor recorded over 18 hours of additional improvised material for the film, and the finished product is one of the greatest existing tributes to his manic energy as a performer, alongside his vast gallery of impressions. 2230 9. Alice in Wonderland (1951)Another magnificent adaptation of complex source material, Disney’s take on Alice in Wonderland doesn’t get lost in Lewis Caroll’s maze of wordplay, but cooks up its own delightful nonsense. Alice gets read to filth by a patch of garden flowers, Ed Wynn’s Mad Hatter oozes moneyed eccentricity, and there is a general psychedelic vibe to the whole affair. Alice in Wonderland was initially a flop, but there’s no denying its status as a cult classic now. 2330 8. The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996)The Hunchback of Notre Dame is easily the most adult Disney film ever made. There’s religious hypocrisy, lust, genocide, prejudice, violent misogyny, infanticide, and corruption – take your pick! Although Disney certainly used a little creative license in adapting the 19th-century Victor Hugo novel (there are no singing gargoyles in the original, sadly), it’s surprising how fluently its central themes have been translated without threatening the film’s PG rating. 2430 7. Lilo and Stitch (2002)Although it was technically released in the dip that followed the Disney Renaissance, Lilo \u0026amp Stitch is a highly underrated entry that deserves to sit among the classics. Few Disney films speak to real experiences like it does. Look past the alien intruders and Stitch’s more unusual characteristics, and you’ll find a reminder that family is defined only as those who love and support us, no matter where we find them. It’s a simple but pure message, elevated by a cast of characters who act and speak like those we recognise in our own lives. This is the Disney film that comes closest to a David Lynch fever dream. Putting “When You Wish Upon a Star” – the song that best captures Walt Disney’s dream – aside for a moment, let’s remember just how much of a surrealist nightmare the Pleasure Island sequence really is. “Be virtuous or you’ll be turned into a literal donkey,” was quite the threat for an America only recently freed from the grip of Prohibition. It’s a weird and wonderful entry from Disney’s early years. We’re free to question Ariel’s decision to trade her voice so she can chase after a cute guy she met only once, but she will always remain the most loveable dinglehopper-collecting weirdo around. Ariel’s unquenchable curiosity is what makes this aquatic tale so charming, second only to the fact its villain was inspired by the legendary Divine. Plus, “Under the Sea” is such a party tune. Sleeping Beauty is Disney’s most beautiful film, thanks to the fact artists John Hench and Eyvind Earle drew heavily from Medieval tapestries, Renaissance art, and even Japanese prints. It gives the feeling of actually flipping through a storybook, as Aurora wanders a forest that looks as if it’s made entirely of stained glass. And, truly, has there ever been a Disney villain as deviously elegant as Maleficient? One of Disney’s boldest and most avant garde films, Fantasia is simply masterful in its concept. A musical education for many young viewers, the film pairs classical pieces with short animated stories, each wildly different and inventive in its own right. Although Mickey’s appearance in The Sorcerer’s Apprentice has had a life of its own outside of the original film, anyone who grew up with Fantasia is probably more likely to remember the nightmares Chernabog gave them – the Night on Bald Mountain sequence is unlike anything else in the Disney canon. 2930 2. Beauty and the Beast (1991)If you need a sign of exactly how impressive a piece of filmmaking Beauty and the Beast is, reflect on the fact that a love story between a woman and a buffalo-bear-man is the first animated film ever to have been nominated for an Academy Award. And this is nearly two decades before The Shape of Water brought interspecies romance to the ceremony. This is truly “a tale as old as time”, with a lush Alan Menken score (with lyrics by Howard Ashman) and a smart, relatable heroine in Belle. Produced at the height of Disney’s Renaissance in the 1990s, The Lion King is an epic testament to what animation can achieve as a medium. Can it match the power of its source material, William Shakespeare’s Hamlet? Well, when Rafiki lifts an infant Simba up to the skies, as an entire kingdom of savannah creatures bows in servitude, all soundtracked to “Circle of Life”, you can’t help but feel momentarily convinced. A film of stunning vistas, heart-wrenching tragedy, and memorable musical moments, there’s no doubt that The Lion King deserves its place as one of the greatest animated films of all time. Netflix currently has a large lead over its competitors after adding a record 9.6 million new subscribers in the first three months of the year taking it to a total of 149 million.But Disney has an unrivalled back catalogue of television programmes and movies including the Star Wars and Marvel franchises.Not all of that content will be available when the company launches its first solo venture later this year, kids-focused streaming service Disney Plus.\u0026nbspAccording to executives, Disney is considering offering Hulu as a bundle alongside Disney Plus\u0026nbspand its sports service, ESPN Plus.AT\u0026ampT came by its Hulu stake after buying Time Warner, which invested $583m in Hulu in 2016. Now the company, known as WarnerMedia, is launching its own streaming service this year, which will focus on HBO and other shows and movies owned by the company.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

In an era when extravagance had well and truly taken hold, the staging was notably bare. The orchestra, the belting, the key changes, and the five backing singers dressed as a cross between beauty queens and security guards all make this feel like the climax of a modern opera. Has Eurovision ever seen anything like it, before or since? Finland’s first win after 45 years of participating came at the hands of a heavy metal band dressed in monster costumes – but this ranking is not based on novelty alone. Behind the growled vocals and pyrotechnics, “Hard Rock Hallelujah” is a pretty great song – even for those who ordinarily can’t stand this kind of thing. The backing vocals on the chorus are a particular high. It also provided a welcome departure from the high-octane pop-fest that many believe Eurovision to be. The jewel in the crown of Ireland’s seven wins is this corker from Logan, who returned looking every inch the matinee idol in his pristine white suit. It’s the kind of big power ballad that fist-clenching was made for, and his big build on “I will always love you” should win another prize for the most ambitious key change.One of Sweden’s most popular entries, Carola is winning from the moment she bounds on stage and lets out that first “Woah-oh-oh!”. Her voice is flawless, the key changes are great, and who doesn’t appreciate a wind machine? Another slice of Scandi pop perfection.A high energy pop song with colourful young performers and fun choreography – “Making Your Mind Up” is the stuff that Eurovision is made of. The famous moment when the boys ripped off the girls’ skirts only to reveal shorter skirts beneath them is one of the competition’s most famous moments. A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic.

A number one hit record across Europe that year, the song remains as infectious today as ever.Celine Dion was just 20 years old when she came to international attention with this performance. The song itself is excellent – a French chanson worthy of Edith Piaf, with a slightly twee drum machine stepping up the beat for a bop of a chorus. This all took place before Celine was transformed into an ageless power ballad queen (see the pageant-esque hair and outfit), but it’s thrilling to hear how her vocals were sheer perfection even then. Oh, and the arm choreography was well on its way too.710 4. “Love Shine a Light” – Katrina and the Waves (United Kingdom, 1997) The beautiful fusion of hammond organ, tambourines, hand clapping and the quasi-spiritual lyrics themselves make this feel like a glorious hymn – and Katrina really takes it to church. One of the highest scorers in modern times, this was the last time the UK won the competition, and it came the day after Labour’s landslide 1997 election victory. What a time to be alive.Conchita’s performance had everything you could want in a Eurovision performance. Elegant and fierce all at once, “Rise Like a Phoenix” could match the finest Bond theme, and is easily one of the most timeless of all the winners. The big band adds to the glamour of it all, and brings the goosebumps on that dramatic orchestral rise towards the final chorus. It was a powerful moment for LGBT+ visibility, too the song’s theme of triumph over adversity secured it as an anthem for life’s survivors.It’s hard to pick any other recent winner that comes as close to contemporary chart toppers as “Euphoria” – a dance hit that many contemporary pop stars would kill for. Written by Sweden’s Thomas G:son – who has produced more than 90 songs for Eurovision competitors across multiple countries – “Euphoria” is built on clever pop formulas. The chorus itself is anthemic perfection, but when Loreen tacks on: “We’re going up, up, up...” it strikes gold. The Kate Bush-esque performance was an added bonus.ABBA burst onto the stage at the 1974 competition, kickstarting Sweden’s international reputation as masters of pop. Early adopters of the kind of kitsch which would come to typify the show, ABBA used their platform to offer a taste of the cultural phenomenon they would go on to become. From the opening piano build to the switch between a minor bridge and major chorus, to the catchy hooks littered throughout, “Waterloo” is a masterclass in how to write a hit, and the song rightly went on to become one of the best-selling singles of all time. ABBA continue to influence Eurovision contestants to this day, and while you may have another favourite, “Waterloo” is a song on which most people can agree is a solid gold classic. We promise to love you forever more.The “Like a Prayer” star recently spoke out over the controversy surrounding her performance, as anti-Israel campaigners urge her to boycott the competition in support of Palestine.“I’ll never stop playing music to suit someone’s political agenda nor will I stop speaking out against violations of human rights wherever in the world they may be,” Madonna told Reuters.“My heart breaks every time I hear about the innocent lives that are lost in this region and the violence that is so often perpetuated to suit the political goals of people who benefit from this ancient conflict.”\u0026nbspShe added: “I hope and pray that we will soon break free from this terrible cycle of destruction and create a new path towards peace.”Wolf Alice back Eurovision boycott of \u0027human rights abusers\u0027 IsraelEverything you need to know ahead of Eurovision 2019Iceland\u0027s Hatari: ‘We\u0027re the pink elephant in the room at Eurovision’However Sand, who has produced the contest for almost a decade, said negotiations for the performance were still underway.“We are in a situation now that is a bit strange,” he said. “We have an artist who would like to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest, and who we would love to welcome on that stage. But for that we need to have the framework secured.“We are negotiating now, in the final stage of that - but if there is no signed contract this week, she will not be on the stage.”The Independent\u0026nbsphas contacted Madonna\u0027s representatives for comment.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We know that the income\u0026nbspof less well-off families has been hit by severe real-terms cuts in benefits and by higher housing costs.”The number of youngsters who fall below the poverty line rose to 4.1 million between 2010-11 and\u0026nbsp2017-18, according to the research.\u0026nbspMore than half of youngsters are affected in some areas.Around 5.1 million children will be living in poverty by\u0026nbsp2022\u0026nbspas a result of cuts to benefits and in-work allowances,\u0026nbspthe Institute for Fiscal Studies has predicted.The latest data, based on estimates by researchers from Loughborough University, show the London borough of Tower Hamlets has the highest rate, with 57 per cent of children living in poverty.Newham, Hackney, Luton and Manchester also have among the highest levels of child poverty, all above\u0026nbsp45 per cent.Ms Feuchtwang said the government must “urgently” set a course of action to “free children from the grip of poverty”.As an inner-city teacher, I see the appalling reality of child povertyThe government’s defence has gone – it is time to act on child povertyGovernment condemned over ‘shocking’ rise in child povertyThe government must act on child poverty warningsShe said: “We\u0026nbspknow that work alone does not guarantee a route out of poverty, with two thirds of child poverty occurring in working families.“Yet in many areas, growing up in poverty is not the exception, it’s the rule\u0026nbsp– with more children expected to get swept up in poverty in the coming years, with serious consequences for their life chances.”The End Child Poverty coalition called on ministers to restore the link between benefits and inflation. Campaigners also asked officials to make up the loss in the real value in children’s benefits as a result of the four-year freeze and previous sub-inflation increases in benefit rates.The coalition\u0026nbspalso urged ministers to reverse cuts and invest in children’s services such as mental health, education, childcare and social care, as well as end the two-child limit on child allowances in tax credits and universal credit.Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said it was time for the government to “wake up to the growing poverty crisis in Britain”.She added: “If we are to succeed as a country, we must invest in our children.\u0026nbspBut by 2021, our social security system will have shrunk by £36bn\u0026nbspper year, with disastrous consequences for families across the UK.”Government condemned over ‘shocking’ rise in child povertyProfessor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), said the figures showed the gap between rich and poor was widening, and that this was “extremely frightening” not just for child health, but for the future population.\u0026nbspHe said: “Child poverty doesn’t just determine whether a child can attend a school trip or has a safe and warm place to sleep. There is so much more to it. Left unaddressed, poverty can alter the trajectory of a child’s entire life. \u0026nbsp“We know children living on or below the breadline are more likely to develop mental health issues, become overweight or obese, and die early. They are also more likely to misuse substances.”Levels of child poverty in local areas\u0026nbspwere compiled by academics at the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University using a new method for estimating child poverty using a range of indicators.The latest figures relate\u0026nbspto relative rather than absolute poverty. Relative poverty means living in a household where income is less than 60 per cent of the national average (median).Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 51Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Conservator Restorer Jim Mitchell with part of the bronze statue of William Wallace which is being returned to the National Monument in Stirling after undergoing vital restoration work.

Children growing up in working households are five times less likely to be in relative poverty, which is why we are supporting families to improve their lives through work. And statistics show employment is at a joint record high, wages are outstripping inflation and income inequality and absolute poverty are lower than in 2010.“But we recognise some families need more support. That is why we continue to spend £95bn a year on working-age benefits and provide free school meals to more than 1 million of the country’s most disadvantaged children to ensure every child has the best start in life.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

British Prime Minister Theresa May will today chair a potentially volatile meeting of her cabinet amid reports of an attempted coup by colleagues over her handling of Brexit.“The Commissioner also expressed concern that MI5 should have reported the compliance risks to him sooner.”Data accessed under the Investigatory Powers Act can include private messages, browsing history and location information.The human rights group Liberty condemned authorities for refusing to disclose details of the breach, what information had been put at risk and how long for.One of their lawyers, Megan Goulding, said the case was deeply concerning and showed how “fatally flawed the oversight system for security services is”.Government quietly passed ‘assault on freedom’, campaigners sayPolice use surveillance technology to identify people by walking styleShe added: “This is a clear cut example of how the supposed safeguarding and oversight system is failing to protect us from the excessive and unwarranted surveillance and data retention powers created under the snooper’s charter.\u0026nbspIt is possible, from what is known, that millions of innocent people’s data is being shared widely with foreign governments. If the government has its way, we will never know if this is the case.“If the UK’s surveillance regime is to have a semblance of legitimacy, the public needs to know what happened, and how badly our privacy and the security of our information were put at risk.”Mr Javid said he could not give further information for national security reasons but further details would be included in Ipco’s annual report.“The work MI5 do is absolutely critical, at a time when the threat from terrorism persists and continues to ersify,” he added.\u0026nbsp“It is of course paramount that UK intelligence agencies demonstrate full compliance with the law. In that context, the interchange between the commissioner and MI5 on this issue demonstrates that the world leading system of oversight established by the Act is working as it should.”The Investigatory Powers Commissioner, Lord Justice Fulford, said he was first notified at a meeting in February and immediately requested written information that was received in March.“I then asked a team of inspectors from my office to spend a week in MI5 investigating the extent of the compliance risks that had been identified,” he added.UK citizens put under intense new spying regime“I am reassured that MI5 has taken immediate steps to introduce a series of mitigating actions in the light of that thorough review, and these actions – along with a programme of further measures that will be progressively implemented – provide sufficient reassurance that MI5’s handling arrangements within the particular area of concern are now satisfactory as regards warranted material.”Ipco has carried out a follow-up inspection and will conduct regular reviews.The home secretary said MI5 had taken “immediate and substantial mitigating actions” in response to the Ipco report and that implementation was being monitored.“The compliance risks identified are limited to how material is treated after it has been obtained,” he said.“They do not relate in any way to the manner in which MI5 acquires information in the first instance or the necessity and proportionality of doing so,” he added.“All UK intelligence agencies treat protection of personal information seriously.”It came as Liberty mounts a wider legal challenge to the Investigatory Powers Act, which will be heard at the High Court next month.Campaigners are to argue that bulk surveillance that captures messages, browsing history and other large datasets without suspicion “dangerously undermines privacy and free expression”.Last year, the High Court found the power to order private companies to store communications data, including internet history, so that state agencies can access it breached the right to privacy.In September, the European Court of Human Rights found that the UK’s previous regime for bulk interception of communications data was unlawful before it was replaced by the 2016 Investigatory Powers ActOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These could possibly be included as a clause in the bill, rather than a standalone meaningful vote.Brexit Party most popular for Euro vote only among over-55sThe vote on WAB will come during a crucial week in Westminster, with Mr Trump set to spend three days in the UK to coincide with 75th anniversary of D-Day – making a potential defeat for the prime minister even more humiliating.Voters in Peterborough will also head to the polls in a by-election, after the disowned Labour politician Fiona Onasanya became the first MP to be removed by her constituents last month.Arch-Eurosceptic Steve Baker, deputy chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, gave the WAB little chance of passing.“If the Brexit Party were demanding\u0026nbspwe pass this Withdrawal Agreement, it might make sense,” he told The Independent.“But they aren’t. Quite the reverse. And driving it through over the heads of the DUP appears to eradicate the government’s majority. What are they thinking?”The remarks from the two leaders came after foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt used a speech shortly after the cabinet meeting to warn that both the Conservative and Labour Party would be “crucified” by voters if they failed to respect the 2016 referendum result.Referring to the cross-party talks, he told the Wall Street Journal CEO Council conference in London: “There is potential because when you look at the fundamentals it is actually in both parties’ interests to resolve Brexit.\u0026nbspMay faces pressure to pull plug on Brexit talks amid lack of progress“Because both of us will be crucified by our base if we went into a general election having promised that we would respect the referendum result, not having respected it.\u0026nbsp“And I think the lesson at the local elections is that the downside for Labour is as big as the downside for us. I don’t think it’s impossible that there could be a deal there.”Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman, told The Independent: There\u0027s not a snowball\u0027s chance in hell that the WAB will go through.Parliament will look very unkindly on an attempt to bring forward a bill to implement a deal that has not been approved by parliament.In the absence of a People\u0027s Vote or a confirmatory vote, there are no circumstances in which this could command a majority. It is the last roll of the dice for a government which is seeking to give the impression of action on Brexit a few days before it suffers an embarrassing disaster in the European elections.But there\u0026nbspwas little enthusiasm in Brussels regarding any developments in Westminster, as a spokesperson for the EU commission said leaders of the 27 member states are on a “Brexit break”.\u0026nbspThey said the EU would only turn its attention to Brexit again “if there is something happening in London”, as the UK’s chief negotiator in the civil service, Olly Robbins, was expected to travel to the Belgian capital on Wednesday to discuss the future UK-EU relationship, post-Brexit.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as a crime in its own right, bribery can cause other societal harms. For example, bribes paid to secure construction contracts using sub-standard material could have future health and safety impacts on the public.”The NCA said companies use intermediaries in targeted countries to facilitate bribes using local knowledge and connections, including with politicians and officials.Its annual report warned that there were already at least 181,000 offenders linked to serious and organised crime in the UK and called for law enforcement to be given an extra £2.7bn to combat the threat.“The majority of serious and organised crime in the UK continues to have clear international links,” Ms Owens said.\u0026nbsp“Organised crime groups active in the UK continue to source illegal commodities and exploit the vulnerable from beyond our shores, underlining the importance of international partnerships.”The UK is currently part of about 40 trade agreements which the EU has with more than 70 countries, but will lose them immediately if it leaves without a deal.The government has been attempting to replicate EU trade agreements “as far as possible”, but so far only nine continuity deals have been struck with authorities including Chile, the Caribbean, Pacific Islands, Chile, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.The UK has also signed “mutual recognition agreements” with the US, Australia and New Zealand, but they do not amount to free trade agreements.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Cameron resigned on 24 June 2016, following the EU referendum result.David Davis resigned from his post as Brexit secretary in July 2018 after disagreeing with Theresa May\u0027s negotiation strategy.Michael Gove was one of the most influential Leave voices during the EU referendum campaign.Jacob Rees-Mogg, a prominent backbencher, does not support a second Brexit referendum. “Because we are not going to solve this problem by retreating to populist extremes.”Mr Hunt’s comments come ahead of the 23 May European elections, with a new poll predicting that the Conservative Party could come fifth, as Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party surges.The Tories also lost more than 1,300 council seats in this month’s local elections.On Tuesday the Cabinet minister\u0026nbspsaid both the Conservatives and Labour would be “crucified” by voters if they failed to solve the current Brexit stalemate.“Both of us will be crucified by our base if we went into a general election having promised that we would respect the referendum result, not having respected it,” he said.“And I think the lesson of the local elections is that the downside for Labour is as big as the downside for us.“I don’t think it’s impossible that there could be a deal there.”Cross-party talks between Labour and the Conservatives are continuing but both sides have expressed frustration at a lack of progress.“I think it’s actually impressive that it’s lasted as long at it has,” he said.“But, I don’t think anyone can be confident of an outcome one way or the other.”Despite the ongoing deadlock the 52-year-old insisted that there was no need for a second referendum or a general election.“I think you can never discount any of these potential outcomes,” he said.“But I think a general election and a second referendum are my least likely outcomes because Brexit ides all the parties.“It is difficult to see how a general election, particularly, changes the situation, and I also think it is very, very unpopular for MPs, for understandable reasons.”Asked if the next Tory leader would embrace the option of a no-deal, the foreign secretary said: “I think it is very difficult... to get a successful outcome to a negotiation if the other side thinks you will never walk away.“And I think in a way, that has been part of the reason why we have come to the impasse in the current negotiations, because the other side, Europeans, have sensed that the UK isn’t prepared to walk away, and that has meant that they have not been prepared to be as flexible as they might otherwise have been.”“No-deal remains the default legal position and we continue to make preparations for a no-deal scenario,” Theresa May’s spokesperson said in response to Mr Hunt’s comments.“Parliament has, however, clearly expressed the view that it wants the UK to leave with a deal and that is what the PM is working to deliver.”Additional reporting by agenciesThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is clear that, once again, many people have been denied their say – indeed, many more than there were allegations of personation fraud in the whole of the UK last year.“This ‘show your papers’ policy presents an unprecedented risk to democratic access and equality. Possession of ID is not universal – with millions of people lacking the required forms of identification. If rolled out nationwide, mandatory voter ID could see tens of thousands of legitimate voters made voiceless.\u0026nbsp“Trust in our democratic system is vital – which is why ministerial scaremongering about fraud is especially dangerous.\u0026nbspMinisters must now focus on combatting the real threats to our democracy – rather than suppressing voters’ rights.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Groups such as the ACLU point to its test of Amazon’s facial recognition programme – called Amazon Rekognition – as proof, after scanning images of members of Congress and comparing them to archived arrest photos. Twenty-eight legislators were incorrectly matched, including six members of the Congressional Black Caucus.Meanwhile, critics say police need all the help they can get, especially in a city with high-profile events and high rates of property crime. That people expect privacy in public space is unreasonable given the proliferation of cell phones and surveillance cameras, said Meredith Serra, a member of a resident public safety group Stop Crime SF.“To me, the ordinance seems to be a costly additional layer of bureaucracy that really does nothing to improve the safety of our citizens,” she said at the same hearing.San Francisco’s new rule, which is set to go into effect in a month if a second vote, considered a formality goes ahead, forbids the use of facial-recognition technology by the city’s 53 departments — including the San Francisco police department, which doesn’t currently use such technology, CNN said. However, the ordinance carves out an exception for federally controlled facilities at San Francisco International Airport and the Port of San Francisco.\u0026nbspLate last year, the president of Microsoft called for greater government regulation of AI facial recognition technology, because of the risk of it discriminating against women and people of colour.Brad Smith said such regulation would help avoid “a commercial race to the bottom, with tech companies forced to choose between social responsibility and market success”.Facial recognition tech trained on of photos of people without consentBefore facial recognition tech can be used, it needs to be limitedTaylor Swift uses facial recognition software to identify stalkersNew iPhone to improve facial recognition feature, report claimsThe comments of Mr Smith, 59, which were released at the same time as a report by a research group consisting of both Microsoft and Google employees also calling for more regulation, are especially noteworthy because of the controversy the company triggered earlier this year over comments about its work with AI.In June, the company’s general manager Tom Keane, wrote how proud Microsoft was to be working with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) to use facial recognition technology to help identify immigrants and process applications.Additional reporting by Associated PressOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Of the 595 likely Democrat voters in the poll, eight per cent said they would back the South Bend mayor, enough to place him fourth. When this is broken down, 18 per cent of white voters said they would back Mr Buttgieg, but 0 per cent of black voters would. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus four per cent.A national poll released last month by Monmouth University found that Mr Buttigieg is at two per cent support among the African-American community, staring up at the likes of California Senator Kamala Harris and former Texas Representative Beto O\u0027Rourke, as well as former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders who are leading the race.Mr Biden is favoured by 46 per cent of would-be Democratic voters in South Carolina, while Mr Sanders sits second at 15 per cent.Given the importance of the black vote in the 2020 primary, this is a big challenge for the South Bend mayor, according to Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist based in South Carolina.Created with Sketch.The Democrat challengers to Trump in 2020 Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The 2016 runner-up has announced that he will be running again in 2020The former vice president - poised to be a frontrunner - has announced his run.

I use my mother as any example with this. She won\u0027t go to a political event or rally, but her and her friends will show up to vote in every election.”Candidates seem acutely aware of the value of doing well in South Carolina, with African-American candidates Ms Harris and Senator Cory Booker having held more than a dozen events in the state each. Mr O\u0027Rourke has also held 13 events and Mr Biden visited the state earlier this month.“I’ve never seen this amount of activity in South Carolina,” Jaime Harrison, the former South Carolina Democratic party head who is running for Senate in 2020 told The Financial Times. “If I throw a rock, I will hit at least two or three candidates.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add yourCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeCreate a commenting name to join the debateIndependent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Mr Toroczkai left Jobbik last year and has accused his former party of betraying the “national cause.Mr Toroczkai has claimed the new group would be available to provide help after natural disasters and to support people facing evictions from their homes.However, Vince Szava, head of the Hungarian National Ethnic Minorities Interest Protection Association, condemned the National Legion’s formation and said he hoped it will be disbanded by the authorities.\u0026nbsp“We have to prevent the advance of parties and organisations with neo-Nazi ideas,” said Mr Szava, who is Roma.\u0026nbspMr Toroczkai said the National Legion would also serve as an umbrella organisation for similar groups and has unspecified legal strategies to use if Hungarian authorities try to break up the group.He said his party would\u0026nbsphold a march next week in the eastern city of Torokszentmiklos – despite a police ban. The march comes as a Roma man is suspected of injuring several people in a series of unprovoked attacks in the city.\u0026nbspThe party has appealed the ban in court, but will try to hold it in some form even if the appeal is rejected.The National Legion’s formal founding ceremony will take place on 1 June in the southern city of Szeged.\u0026nbspMr Toroczkai’s party is running for Hungary’s 21 seats in the European parliament in elections later this month, with its manifesto calling for a parliament led by “patriotic forces”. However, current projections have them only gaining about 2 per cent of the vote\u0026nbsp– not enough to gain a seat.Speaking to BBC’s HARDtalk in March, Mr Toroczkai said he was against migration into Hungary, using similar language to that describing the formation of the National Legion.“We need to defend our culture. I respect the Islam in Saudi Arabia but Hungary is a Christian country. Our traditions are Christian traditions, he said.“The European Union is not working now, the EU cannot preserve the European culture. Who will defend the European people?

And I know he’s a tough man, but he’s a respected man,” Mr Trump said.“He’s done the right thing, according to many people, on immigration. And you look at some of the problems that they have in Europe that are tremendous because they’ve done it a different way than the prime minister,” Mr Trump added.Associated Press contributed to this reportOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We are here, do not ever give up!” said Ekrem Imamoglu. He is still in high spirits,\u0026nbspeven after his mandate as Istanbul’s newly appointed mayor was revoked\u0026nbsplast week\u0026nbspby Turkey’s Supreme Election Board.“Our path is a long one. Our excitement is at peak. We have our youth. We are the Turkish youth, thirsty for justice and fully committed to democracy. Nobody can stop this nation, its freedoms, its democracy.”The heated speech by Imamoglu, of the opposition CHP, was aired live on social media outlets and reached a record number of more than 3 million viewers that night. Meanwhile, almost all national channels, owned by pro-government businesses, ignored the broadcast.Official news bulletins focused on the claims by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) of “irregularities and corruption”, which were cited by the board in its decision for a rerun of mayoral elections. The vote will be held on 23 June.In a televised speech the next day, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish president and chair of the AKP, insisted there had been improper appointments of some election officials and claimed some had links to terror groups.Created with Sketch.Election in Turkey: the reaction in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Supporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the result“The documents we’ve presented are quite solid and based on concrete evidence, which cannot be disputed,” said Erdogan.“We sincerely believe there was organised corruption and irregularities.”\u0026nbspImamoglu, the Republican People’s Party (CHP) candidate, however, denounced the decision as politically motivated and highlighted alleged discrepancies in the government’s own claims.Turkey officials order redo of Istanbul vote voiding opposition winEven though his full address never made it to mainstream channels, social media experts claim that such a dismissive approach by the government, combined with Imamoglu’s tech savvy methods of publicising his message, would boost his popularity\u0026nbspon and offline before the rerun.“Ekrem Imamoglu’s attitude both on the night, and in the aftermath of the March 31 elections, of focusing on facts, created the perception among opposition voters that ‘if he’s speaking, he must know what he’s speaking about’,” says Can Selcuki, general manager of Istanbul Economics\u0026nbspresearch firm.Erdogan\u0027s party challenges results of Istanbul electionIt was not the first time the young politician had garnered such large online crowds.On election night in March, the opposition politician used his Twitter account as a private news channel and aired 11 live press briefings after the semi-official Anadolu Agency cut its coverage, lapsing into silence for nearly 12 hours at a pivotal point in the contest.The number of Imamoglu’s followers, now\u0026nbsp2.3 million, reached 869,000 from 382,000 overnight. His live feeds were viewed over 449,000 times by the time of the decision on a rerun, according to Medyascope, an online news outlet. The same night, his name was the third top Twitter trend worldwide.Istanbul’s mayoral election re-run will only make Erdogan weakerAn average post by the young leader receives an audience of around two million, public online data shows.The soft-spoken politician’s motto, #HerseyCokGuzelOlacak, “Everything will be fine,” has struck a chord, inspiring numerous impartial voices in Turkey’s halls of finance, arts and sports to come out in support of Imamoglu before the rerun.President Erdogan expressed his disdain for sports fans who chanted Imamoglu’s slogan at stadiums last week as he attended a Ramadan dinner in Istanbul on Sunday.“It was us who built these stadiums,” he said. “We cannot accept this.”The new vote in Istanbul is as much about the leader’s seemingly threatening undertone, compared to Imamoglu’s embracing talk, as it is about the future of Erdogan’s current government, political analysts argue.CHP hold Turkish flags in front of the party’s\u0026nbspheadquarters (EPA)Once a name unknown to the majority in Turkey, Imamoglu has used social media\u0026nbspto introduce himself and spread his word, often airing scenes from his daily life – shopping in the local market, dining with his family, visiting community centres. By broadcasting the seemingly mundane, he has successfully engaged the internet generation.In three short months, he came to be referred to as the “rising star” of Turkish politics.For two weeks during his short-lived appointment as mayor, he made a historical move to broadcast Istanbul municipality assembly meetings live on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, keeping his promise of continued transparency. Sure enough, the public took note.Imamoglu’s\u0026nbsplive feeds and information flow on social media make a difference in terms of transparency and credibility as you cannot manipulate anyone if they have first-hand access to informationEven on a Wednesday morning when most people would be busy at work or otherwise occupied with daily life, a live broadcast during which ruling party members rejected a drug prevention commission saw a record number of more than 1.5 million viewers.Shorter clips of the vote circulated even more, perhaps helped by the many puzzled reactions as to why a religiously conservative party would oppose an anti-drug initiative.Some argued it was the governing party’s strategy to avenge the unexpected win of the opposition by blocking the new mayor’s moves, while its supporters argued such a commission should not be part of the municipality remit.Imamoglu, the original architect of this open debate, has vowed to continue the dialogue among polarised political groups under absolute online transparency.Such a digital strategy had long been brewing when Imamoglu’s Republican People’s Party, the CHP, and other opposition groups were widely denied exposure in Turkey’s mainstream, pro-government media.Do you need social media followers to get a book deal?A study by an online ersity platform showed that in 2017, before a critical referendum, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan appeared on national TV channels for 53 hours compared to the 17 hours of the CHP leader and the 33 minutes of the pro-Kurdish\u0026nbspPeople’s Democracy Party.Freedom of expression has slumped in recent years more than 150 journalists have been jailed, most since the failed coup of 2016. Recently, the Paris-based Reporters Without Borders ranked Turkey 157th out of 179 in their 2019 World Press Freedom Index.Imamoglu, as well as other opposition candidates, took to Facebook, Twitter and YouTube\u0026nbspto reach over 57 million voters and connect with their constituencies – because there was no other realistic alternative.“Social media makes a jump at times when the mainstream media fails to serve its purpose – it’s as clear as that,” says Tirse Erbaysal Filibeli, head of Istanbul Bahcesehir University’s New\u0026nbspMedia department.Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses supporters at a rally in Antalya in March\u0026nbsp(AP)“Imamoglu’s live feeds and information flow on social media make a difference in terms of transparency and credibility as you cannot manipulate anyone if they have first-hand access to information.”Although the number\u0026nbspof interactions appears remarkable in a media landscape where opposition figures would otherwise have no exposure, digital analysts nonetheless warn against over-interpreting social media’s impact on changing people’s beliefs or behaviour.Imamoglu\u0026nbspsucceeded not because he better utilised social media.\u0026nbspHis success came as a reflection of the reaction he caused in offline politics, because he was a better politician than previous candidatesYet in a young population such as Turkey, the 90.7 per cent internet access among 16 to 24-year-olds, as registered by the Turkish Statistics Institute in 2018, remains an attractive prospect for all political actors, as well as international media outlets.\u0026nbspIn late April, the BBC, Deutsche Welle, France24 and Voice of America – all taxpayer-funded or state-subsidised services in their respective countries – pioneered a joint news channel on YouTube, called +90, targeting Turkish speaking audiences worldwide.The shared platform, named after the international dialling code for Turkey, was “forward looking to the future of the media”, said Peter Limbourg, director general of Deutsche Welle, the driving force behind the initiative, speaking at a press conference in Istanbul.“If you look at the sheer amount of Turkish language on Twitter, YouTube, not to even mention Facebook accounts, obviously Turks are very exciting they know what’s going on,” added Gallagher Fenwick, the head of France24 English.Turkish journalist from opposition newspaper beaten up in street“So, obviously, this is an extremely exciting market for that reason.”But even in the most vibrant internet environment, well-budgeted and coordinated digital campaigns are still doomed to fail unless supported by strong politics and politicians with convincing messages, experts argue.“Imamoglu succeeded not because he better utilised social media,” says Akin Unver, professor of international relations at Istanbul’s Kadir Has University.“His success came as a reflection of the reaction he caused in offline politics, because he was a better politician than previous candidates.”Now, CHP’s Imamoglu and his team are set for another challenge – but this time they have an established base of millions of supporters, flamed by a profound sense of injustice, say campaign organisers.“Since the news on a rerun, people from almost all parts of society have pursued a ‘digital initiative’ putting forward some kind of personal political campaign. Thus, there is no longer an organised campaign in place but an organic one,” says Cagri Isiklioglu, one of the leaders in the nationwide social media campaign for the CHP.“At this point the most important thing is to ensure the security of the ballot boxes on 23 June.”Imamoglu won’t get things his own way, however, even online. Instagram has become a leading news outlet, with the opposition star attracting over 4 million followers on the social media tool.Imamoglu\u0026nbsphas mobilised offline\u0026nbspsupport as effectively as online\u0026nbsp(AP)But President Erdogan, who admittedly has been a political figure for over three decades, has 5.4 million followers on the platform. Then again, his candidate for the Istanbul mayoralty is at only 337,000.With the race back on to determine the next administration of one of Europe’s largest cities, with a budget of $4bn, online platforms are taking pole position insofar as Imamoglu’s ability to engage with voters is concerned.“From now on, online platforms will surely play a greater role in politics because we have entered into a new period of transparency,” Selcuki says.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also co-owns a house in Surrey.Mishcon de Reya first hired him in  as a part-time consultant for its business crime unit.He quit client work for the firm in April , but was reappointed as a consultant to its in-house academy in June this year.The MP stood down from that role after being appointed to the shadow cabinet last month.Starmer is the third key figure from the lacklustre £.m Operation Elveden witchhunt of Sun reporters to be employed by Mishcon de Reya.His former principal legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service Alison Levitt and former politan police assistant commissioner Sue Akers – who headed the bungled investigation – have also done work for the firm.This week Starmer refused to apologise after reporter Anthony France had his conviction overturned - meaning not one of  Sun journalists arrested were convicted.A spokeswoman for the law firm said: “Keir Starmer was a consultant to the Mishcon Academy, our in-house centre for learning and development.“The role did not involve client advice on any issue. Keir resigned as a consultant to the academy when he was appointed to the Shadow Cabinet.”A spokesman for Starmer’s office said: “MPs are required to register and declare fees received since the May  election even where those fees were earned before the election.“The register makes it very clear that in the case of Keir Starmer, the vast majority of his declared earnings represent payment for work undertaken by him as a lawyer before he became MP.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we must try to find a balance.The royals have long-established traditions and do not like change.But given how intense le is for new parents, who can blame Meghan and Harry for wanting to enjoy it alone for a bit Most women avoid cameras for weeks after giving birth. So having a photo taken, under pressure to look gorgeous, scrutinised from every angle, just a couple of days after giving birth  That is a huge ask.I didn’t get out of my pyjamas for a week both times after I had children.Harry and Meghan did a fantastic job introducing Archie to the world.I loved how Harry carried his baby in, already the hands-on father he wants to be, alight with the joy of new fatherhood.However, it was impossible not to think about how wonderful Diana would have been as a grandmother.The birth of a son must be bittersweet for Harry, knowing Diana will never meet Archie.While some grumbled about the two-day wait to show off the baby, others recommend a “babymoon” for parents to shut out the rest of the world and bond with their baby for a week or two.Something tells me that would have been Meghan and Harry’s preference, so this was a compromise.They understand they are public figures.Archie is seventh in line to the throne and his parents know that taxpayers, who in part pay their salary, expected to meet the baby at some point.Most of us only wish to send our love, wish the new parents well and share the moment with them.Within hours of the birth, Meghan’s half-sister had suggested the new arrival meant Meghan was morally obliged to reconnect with her father, Thomas Markle.Let’s be clear. Meghan doesn’t have to do any such thing.She is better off without a father she can’t trust.If your own family are not up to scratch, you make your own based on love, trust and happiness.Given how happy Meghan and Harry look with Archie, they are doing just fine with that.A couple of things really stood out for me about the way they introduced their baby to the world.First, didn’t Meghan look amazing in her Grace Wales Bonner-designed dress I love the fact she chose white, which clearly showed her post-baby bump.She knows what a role model is.And she knows better than to create unrealistic aspirations for women who have just given birth.After all, most mothers still have the bump for at least a few weeks after having a baby.Then there was the look of sheer happiness on the Queen’s face as she looked down at her new great-grandson.Even with her many children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, she radiated a delight she shares with grandmothers up and down the land.It was just beautul to behold.MAMMA mia! Looking at the cover of Sports Illustrated’s annual swimsuit issue – featuring model and entrepreneur Tyra Banks – it’s impossible to believe Tyra’s first cover was  years ago and she came out of “modelling retirement” for the shoot.The very idea of wearing a yellow string bikini – at any age, let alone  – is unimaginable to most of us mere mortals.Butyou’ve got it, flaunt it . . . and Tyra certainly still has it.I AM increasingly convinced the only way to grow old gracefully is simply to accept that it’s happening.So I feel bad for Katie Price, who at  had another facelt last month in Turkey.On Wednesday’s Good Morning Britain, the ex-model discussed her “addiction” to plastic surgery.She explained how she had her own fat injected under her eyes and had the side of her face “lted” in a bid to look more youthful.It sounds horric. Choosing to have serious surgery to look a bit younger is baffling.Maybe she feels defined by her looks and will do anything to hang on to them.When I look at pictures of Katie or watch her on TV, I wish she would be kinder to herself and love herself more.She should worry more about how she feels than how she looks.She needs a best friend – someone who knows everything about her and still loves her – to tell her to stop scratching the wrong itch.Katie should give up the plastic surgery and learn to love herself the way she are . . . wrinkles and all.NOT sure I’ll be taking up Lisa Snowdon’s tip for keeping an eye on how much she eats – using chopsticks for every meal instead of a kne and fork.The TV presenter, , says they slow down her eating, so she feels full more quickly.But whatyou are having soup I HAD a chuckle about the fact that Gregg Wallace’s favoured comment on his we Anne-Marie’s Instagram account is the suggestion that she print out a photo.Someone has compiled a mega-tweet of the many times he has commented on his -year-old partner’s photos, demanding she “print it”.When it comes to social media, that sort of defeats the object.Gregg, I feel for you. It’s hard getting older – and it sucks not understanding the modern way of doing things.WHEN Donald Trump refused to publish his tax s, I assumed it was because he didn’t want people to know how much money he had.It turns out it was because he had so little.His tax s reveal he “lost more money than almost any other American taxpayer for a decade, after his hotels and casinos racked up .BILLION dollars in losses”.So not quite the billionaire he claims he is . . .  or the ace businessman.PERHAPS the most surprising news of this week is that although more alcohol is now being drunk around the world, we Brits are not responsible for the rise.We call them snowflakes but, very often, the young people I meet are much more focused and impressive than my generation ever was.APPARENTLY it’s not just booze we Brits are giving up. Thanks to technology, we are now having less SEX than ever before, too.A major study found there has been a steep decline in rates of intimacy since , with fewer than half of Britons now having sex once a week.Scientists said that “le in the digital age” was partly to blame – with couples now too distracted by Netflix, social media or their phones to focus on each other.But seriously,you prefer Netflix or your phone to sex with your partner... well, it’s time for a orce, I’d say.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was concernedmy vagina would ever look the same again.The pain, pressure and discomfort were excruciating and so I sought a second opinion.With the failure of conservative treatment, I felt that I was heading towards surgery, which made me increasingly anxious.I was worried about scarring my private parts permanently.The physician understood my concern of external scarring and reassured me that he would attempt to drain the haematoma from inside the vagina.Postsurgery, I felt immediate relief and the healing process was uneventful.I was pleasantly surprised as my vagina looked like nothing had ever happened.I am grateful to my physician for being mindful about the cosmetic outcome of his surgical approach and I am glad to not live with a scarred vagina for the rest of my le.Haematomas occur when blood vessels rupture, usually during an injury, and blood collects in the nearby tissue.A vul haematoma is when the blood pools in the vulva - the external part of the female genitalia - and are very rare with an incidence rate of about . percent."},{"url":null,"title":"retired couple hidden garden behind home walsall","story":"Tony and Marie Newton have spent  years and more than £, transforming their back garden and flowerbeds into a beautul oasis in the heartlands of the industrial Black Country.Stunning drone pictures reveal the couples spectacular four seasons garden bursting with colour, so-called for its year-round appeal.The plot spanning over a third of an acre is crammed with  azalea,  Japanese maples and  juniper blue stars.The green-fingered couple, who have four grown-up children and four grandchildren, spend two hours a day lovingly maintaining the plants and bushes.Marie, , started tending the garden in  after she retired from her job as a transport planner and taught herself horticulture as a hobby.They have won several awards, including winning the crown of Britains Best Garden.Marie said: There are over , plants in our garden, so many I cant even count.Its an all season garden so in autumn you see brilliant reds, oranges and yellows and in the spring the colours are equally as vivid and vibrant.There will be azalea and acer leaves along with the evergreen coners.It has been very satisfying to use so many skills, and to have done every task ourselves.All but two of all the plants in our garden have been planted by us.The garden has become so popular the couples home has even made it onto several unofficial tourist trails in the Black Country.Marie added: Weve had over , people from  dferent countries come and visit our garden over the years.Some Chinese students came to visit our garden and told us that it was used as an example in one of the lectures.We spend on average two hours a day in the garden but it can be more or less depending on the weather.We have grown some of the flowers ourselves from the seeds that have dropped from the other flowers.We thought we were behind this year but recently it just came back up.There has been forecast recently that predicted frost which can do a lot of damage to the plants but weve had nothing but we put fleece on the plants just in case.The garden just wakes up in May, its just incredible.Retired GP Tony added: First we made it child friendly for our kids but as the years went by we moved on to planting and growing our own flowers and plants.There has been a lot of trial and error to get the garden way it is now.A lot of our plants are now  years old or more.Weve got a vast amount of colour and plants all year around.

So whatever that takes we have to deliver Brexit urgently”.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt appeared to criticise Mrs May for failing to follow through on her pledge to walk away from negotiations with the EU and leave with no deal.He told a Wall Street Journal conference of chief executives that it is “very, very dficult to get a successful outcome to a negotiationthe other side thinks you will never walk away”.Mr Hunt added: “In a way that is part of the reason why we have an impasse in the current negotiations because [the] other side, the Europeans, have sensed that the UK is not prepared to walk away and that has meant they have not been prepared to be as flexible as they might have been.”He also predicted the Tories and Labour will be “crucied” by votersBrexit isn’t resolved by the next General Election.Mr Hunt said it was “impressive” that the cross-party talks with Labour had lasted for seven weeks but threw doubt on them producing a solution, saying: “I don’t think anyone can be confident of an outcome one way or the other.”Later in a QA Mr Hunt struggled to give an answer when asked why people should vote Tory in next week’s European elections, simply saying: “Because you believe in Conservative policies.”Downing Street confirmed the PM will finally put the Withdrawal Agreement Bill before MPs in the week starting June . No said the talks between Mr Corbyn and Mrs May were useful and constructive but played down the chances of a formal deal being struck between the two parties.A Downing Street spokesman said official talks will resume this week, adding: This evening the Prime Minister met the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons to make clear our determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU.“We will therefore be bringing forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning the rd June. It is imperative we do so thenthe UK is to leave the EU before the summer Parliamentary recess. former Tory Cabinet ministers wrote a letter in The Times urging Mrs May not to sign up to a deal with Labour on a customs union - warning it would lose the loyal middle of the party. It is understood that Mr Corbyn told Mrs May on the hour-long talks last night that there was no chance Labour would support the WAB as it stands.After talks finished a Labour spokesman said: Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May met in Parliament this evening for an hour. The Labour leader set out the shadow cabinets concerns about the Prime Ministers ability to deliver on any compromise agreement.In particular he raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments, following statements by Conservative MPs and Cabinet Ministers seeking to replace the Prime Minister.Jeremy Corbyn made clear the need for further movement from the government, including on entrenchment of any commitments. The Prime Minister’s team agreed to bring back documentation and further proposals tomorrow.DUP leader Nigel Dodds Westminster leader said: “If the Prime Minister brings the Withdrawal bill to the Commons for a vote the question will be “what has changed ”Unless she can demonstrate something new that addresses the problem of the backstop then it is highly likely her deal will go down to defeat once again.The Prime Minister has not pursued the one option that has ever achieved a positive vote for something in Parliament.Alternative arrangements to the backstop won easily whilst everything  has failed.For the bill to have any prospect of success then there must be real change to protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and deliver Brexit.”JEREMY Corbyn is a “Remainer at heart”, John McDonnell said yesterday as he tried to pacy a backbench revolt over Brexit.

The Prime Minister confirmed she would bring a Brexit bill before Parliament the week beginning June rd - just as US President Donald Trump rolls into town for a state visit. Mrs May and Mr Corbyn met for an hour in Parliament. The meeting came after the PM set a fresh deadline of the summer recess for passing her own Brexit deal saying it was imperative the agreement passed before MPs go away on their six-week break. But the cut-off point also signalled her departure date as she has vowed to quit No  once the first stage of the UKaposs departure from the EU is complete. Downing Street said the cross-party negotiations, which have limped into their sixth week without resolution, would continue with officials meeting on Wednesday. But even before the talks Labour was suggesting the PM’s proposal would not be enough and they later confirmed they would not vote for the Withdrawal Bill without agreement in key areas. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned Labour could not “march its troops” up a hill towards a Brexit deal that a new Tory PM such as Boris Johnson could tear up immediately.    Another shadow cabinet minister told the Mirror: “There’s no certainty that anything that’s agreed with Theresa May will be upheld by a new PM. So there’s no point talks continuing. They’re dead, it’s just a matter of when Jeremy tells her.” A Downing Street spokesman said: ”This evening the Prime Minister met the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons to make clear our determination to bring the talks to a conclusion and deliver on the referendum result to leave the EU. “We will therefore be bringing forward the Withdrawal Agreement Bill in the week beginning the rd June. “It is imperative we do so thenthe UK is to leave the EU before the summer Parliamentary recess. “Talks this evening between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition were both useful and constructive. “Tomorrow talks will continue at an official level as we seek the stable majority in Parliament that will ensure the safe passage of the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and the UK’s swt exit from the EU.” MPs have already rejected Mrs May’s plan three times and she has been negotiating with Labour to try to break the impasse. Before the talks, Mr Corbyn told his shadow cabinet he expected the PM to offer a customs agreement that was a union in all but name. But this would only last until the next general election when the parties would decide whether to include in their manestos.   He also claimed the PM’s chief Brexit advisor, Oliver Robbins, would try to negotiate an ongoing say in trade deals from Brussels.

In particular he raised doubts over the credibility of government commitments, following statements by Conservative MPs and Cabinet Ministers seeking to replace the Prime Minister. Jeremy Corbyn made clear the need for further movement from the government, including on entrenchment of any commitments. The Prime Minister’s team agreed to bring back documentation and further proposals tomorrow. A workers’ rights bill that guaranteed to match EU changes to standards as a minimum would be introduced in the House of Lords. Sources suggested Mr Corbyn would be asked to support the PM’s bill during its crucial second reading and leave any attempt to “collapse” the legislation until third reading, its final Commons stage.    But a shadow cabinet minister said: “They’re asking us to take their word for all of this.

That will be a tough decision for some of our MPs.”  Downing Street is gambling on Labour MPs in Leave seats finally swinging behind the plan after what is expected to be damaging European election results for both main parties next week.  And one senior Labour insider said: “Up to two dozen backbenchers have said they won’t be able to hold out much longer. They’re getting so much grief in their constituencies over the failure to deliver Brexit. Some of them have even had death threats.” Foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said a compromise was still possible but admitted talks could not carry on “indefinitely”.

Judge Georgina Kent, sentencing at Kingston Crown Court, described the incident as an exceptionally serious and shocking attempted robbery.    Pheobe Ruele was walking hand-in-hand with her son whom she had just picked up from nursery when two motorcycles road past, pulled into the road and waited for her on June  last year. The court heard McFadyen grabbed her arm hard enough to leave finger-mark bruises and told her: Give me your rings. Iaposm going to hurt your child and take him away. Footage shows the terried woman dragging her child into the road before builders brandishing scaffolding poles chase the gang away. He featured in the TV series in , when he married bride Cheyenne Pidgely when he was  and she was , The Sun reports . McFadyen, , of Feltham, was jailed for  months for conspiracy to rob, while his brother Isaac, , was sentenced to  months in a young offendersapos institution for the same offence.    The gang aged between  and , including ringleader Terry Marsh, were sentenced for offences including conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to burgle, conspiracy to steal and handling stolen goods. Taking them off the streets has helped cut moped-enabled crime in the capital by % in a year, according to the police. The defendants used mopeds to block traffic before taking an angle grinder to cameras rigged up to capture the Boat Race last year. Although their first attempt on Putney Bridge was interrupted by an off-duty police officer, a highly-specialised BBC camera worth up to an estimated £, was stolen from Lonsdale Road by Barnes Bridge. Three gang members - Omar Tafat, , Josh Myers, , and Kian Taylor,  - were arrested on May  last year after a  minute high-speed police chase through London. All three had piled on to the same bike.  At one point they drove the wrong way up the A to try to shake off the helicopter chasing them. The gang carried out a ram raid on high-end outdoor clothing company Altimus Ltd in High Street, Kensington, in December , using a stolen vehicle. Within a month, they ed to raid the store and left the security guard with head injuries, bruises and a foot injury. The two raids cost the business a total of £, in lost goods and damages.

And today, as the landmark celebrated its th anniversary, that phrase still rings true. Within the steel tower that stands majestically over the seaside resort is a beating heart that still makes magic happen for the millions of visitors who pour through its doors. The Efel Tower was the original inspiration for Blackpool Tower – but Blackpool doesn’t do things by halves, so they decided to go one step further than Paris.    The designers created a ft-long ballroom complete with crystal chandeliers, and an oak, mahogany and walnut floor. Every day this historic location is still the place where dreams come true and romance blossoms for ordinary folk from across the land. It is .am and already the ballroom is filling up with dancers dressed in their finest clothes and ­ballroom shoes, ready to take their first steps on to the iconic sprung dancefloor. Forget the sequins and skimpy frocks of Strictly. These ballroom couples are the epitome of old ­Hollywood glamour – gents in ­waistcoats and bow ties, and ladies in floaty skirts that reveal the hint of an ankle and a glittery ­ballroom shoe.    Alan Locke has come all the way from Portadown, Northern Ireland, to celebrate his th birthday. Organist Chris Hopkins made Alan’s day by playing Happy Birthday and asking for a lady volunteer to take him for a celebratory dance. Maureen Carr, , of the Isle of Wight, was happy to oblige and the couple got a heartwarming round of applause as they waltzed around the floor. Ballroom fan Alan first came to Blackpool Tower back in  – and he is never short of dance partners back home either. He says: “I go dancing three times a week and a lot of the ladies who go to the dance club. Their husbands don’t dance, so it is a field day for me! “I have a bit of hip trouble but you don’t feel that when you are gliding along the floor.” Organist Chris has been behind the famous Wurlitzer for  years.    He says: “I came here as a kid and I saw this organ and knew straight away that’s what I wanted to do.” When he left school he worked as a lorry driver for Kellogg’s but used to pay a fiver to go into the Manchester Free Trade Hall to practise on their organ. “I taught myself. In my dinner hour I used to park up the truck and hire the organ for an hour,” he says.    Soon Chris’s name was put forward as a temporary organist for the tower – and he has never looked back. Chris says: “You can go from playing Strauss to Elvis in a couple of minutes. I love my job – it is the Tower Ballroom, the most iconic ballroom in the world. “The people who come here are amazing. Doing my job I give so much joy to everyone every day.“You get ­regulars who come two or three times a week and we get to know what dances they like. They are lovely people and are from a bygone time – you didn’t chat a girl up on Facebook , you had to ask her face to face.” And he has seen more than his fair share of romances blossom on the famous floor. “You get a lot of widows and widowers who come here and then find romance a second time around. “I have seen it so many times and it is lovely to see. The ballroom dancing provides companionship and helps them get over loneliness.” Couples such as Marilyn and Keith Birchall, who met at the ballroom and asked Chris to play on their wedding day in the ballroom  years ago. Marilyn, , and Keith, , from Lancaster, both used to come to the ballroom to dance with their first husband and we.  After their partners passed away they continued to come with friends to keep the memories alive. Marilyn says: “I’d been coming here with my first husband Howard since the s, and Keith and his we Eileen started in the s. We all knew each other in passing. “But when our husband and we passed away we still kept coming. I was supposed to be meeting a friend of mine one day, but he was late. So I got chatting to Keith instead and it went from there. We come here two or three times a week and we just love it. It keeps us fit.” The pair have been married for  years and spent their wedding day at the ballroom – with Chris playing their special requests. Marilyn laughs: “We got married at the register office at am so we could make the most of our day in the ­ballroom. We stayed until pm.” Marilyn and Keith aren’t the only ones to start married le in the Tower. The attraction hosts around  weddings each year – either in the ballroom or at the top of the tower on the skywalk. The viewing­  isn’t for a faint-hearted bride and groom, with only a glass floor standing between them and the promenade ft below. Spare a thought for maintenance man Paul Hulley and his team who have to abseil to change a ­lightbulb on its famous illuminations. Paul, , says: “I’ve worked here for  years – I got the job straight from school and loved it so much I stayed. We just used to wear chest harnesses, but health and safety has moved on.  “But I have to say the first time I abseiled down was quite a daunting task. You are only on a mm rope so it is a bit ­hair-raising.” Paul’s boss Ian Wilson is another man who has not only found a job for le at Blackpool Tower – but also the love of his le. Ian, , is head of maintenance after starting work here in , while his fiancee Bev Anstell, , started work at the tower as a holiday job  years ago and works on reception.  They have been together for  years and now have a daughter Jess, , who also works there. Bev laughs: “It is amazing to work here, there is so much history. My mum even worked here before me. “Everyone has their own stories of Blackpool Tower – you see generations of the same family coming here year after year. “You do fall in love with the tower and the people. I think now our daughter Jess works here too she understands how the tower bug can get you – there is nowhere  like it.”  Tower boss Kate Shane says: “This is a working-class resort, and we love that, we are proud of that. “The tower was giving ­working-class people the opportunity to experience something they’d never see. “There is so much emotion surrounding the tower – everyone has their own little story about it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"couple create britains best garden","story":"NewsRetired couple are hiding an amazing secret behind their unassuming homeTony and Marie Newton have dedicated two hours a day to their incredible garden over a -year periodShareCommentsByMartin Fricker:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsThis unassuming home hides an amazing secret \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPut in two hours of work a day for  years, spend £, and you too could have a garden as spectacular as this oasis in an industrial heartland.

Thanks to geomagnetic storm activity and clear skies, parts of Scotland could be in for a treatpeople look to the sky. Those living in Tayside and Fe could be perfectly positioned to see the aurora - with skies also predicted to remain clear over Dundee, Perth and Angus.The Met Office tweeted: “Moderate geomagnetic storms may lead to aurora sightings in parts of Scotland tonight where the skies stay clear.”Explaining when the UK is most likely to experience a sighting, the Met Office said it usually takes a severe or extreme geomagnetic storm to bring the belt southwards directly over the UK.    The natural aurora belt occurs further north, over countries including Norway, Iceland, Greenland. During more moderate to strong geomagnetic storms, the Aurora Borealis often moves southwards across southern Iceland or towards the Faeroes. These auroras can be faintly visible from the UK because they occur at high altitudes. The stunning phenomenon is created by disturbances in the Earth’s magnetosphere caused by a flow of particles from the Sun, and are usually concentrated around the Earth’s magnetic poles. Clear skies which could lead to a rare glimpse of the Northern Lights are expected to stick around throughout this week.   Meteorologist Craig Snell told The Sun Online: Weaposre going to be expecting very dry weather with plenty of sun within the next three days.The temperature will peak on Wednesday, reaching C in parts of Scotland and northern England. Weaposre going to see some rain creep in the the second half of the week, as temperatures will begin to settle down on Friday. The Met Office website says: A cold start with frost in places, but soon clearing in the sunshine. Skies will stay mainly clear, except for the odd patch of cloud It will be warm during the afternoon, although a little fresher along some coasts.    Wednesdayaposs is similar and reads: After a chilly start it will be another warm, dry and sunny day across the UK. Some thin, high cloud may turn the sunshine a little hazy in the west. Come Friday however, and periods of rain may signal a slide back into the dreary weather that was cast over the isle last week. An unsettled weekend will see rain, cloud and stronger winds taking daytime temperatures below the seasonal average.

So, the next morning she grabbed her youngest daughter, Paislee Ever, and come up with a series of photos that has made the world sit up and listen. The eight-year-old is what her mum describes as a real girly girl.    But thataposs not the end of Paisleeaposs talents, sheaposs also clever and absolutely love sports. This is what was bothering her mum, who couldnapost get the question aposwhy does she have to choose apos out her head. Heather, from Alabama in the US, came up with the idea of dressing her little daughter in a super-feminine way but showing she could also have a passion for sport.

The moment she was born I desperately needed to remember every detail of her almost nine pounds of perfection so I studied photography on dial up internet as she napped in my arms. She is an extremely talented artist, a freshman in high school and the kindest person I have ever known. Paislee Ever is my girly girl athlete who inspired our Because you can do it all series.

The photographer who took pictures of the scene in Monterey Bay, Calornia, US, joked he would have soiled himself had he been on the fishing vessel. Footage of the spectacle shows a fisherman standing spellbound on the vessel, watching as the whale flies up into the air before plunging back down into the water. Douglas Croft, who captured the moment alongside Kate Cummings, told reporters: It was quite exciting!    Salmon season coincides with the time when humpbacks are ing to Monterey Bay to feed for the summer and there were hundreds of boats on the bay fishing. This whale had breached a couple of times before this and many times they’ll just keep doing it. I went below deck to shoot from a porthole close to the water line. That’s what gives this amazing perspective of looking up at the whale. That the breach was directly behind the fishing boat really shows the size. Since the boat is closer, it should look bigger, but the whale is huge! If I’d been the fisherman, I’d probably need some new underwear.    Kate said she had fun capturing the moment on video, which was filmed shortly after the whale was spotted emerging from the water further away on April . She added: Sometimes when whales breach multiple times, theyaposre also heading a specic direction when theyaposre underwater building momentum for the next breach. I figured the next breach would be around the fisherman because the whale was heading that way and sure enough! Though I didnapost expect the whale and the boat to line up so perfectly.

Nicola Arthur put years of heavy drinking and binge eating behind her, and now goes up to  days consuming nothing but water. The yoga coach, from Sydney, Australia, has been taking part in fitness competitions since she was . Before that she began indulging in a party girl lestyle of heavy smoking, binge drinking and overeating. Mum-of-two Nicola stopped her fad diets, smoking, drinking and partying but quickly became obsessed with her new aposhealthyapos regime. For  years she would starve herself all day only to binge on sugary snacks in the evening that made her feel terrible.  It wasnapost until Nicola got married in February  and fell pregnant with her first child Lucia in May  that she found the motivation to really change her lestyle and started only eating raw fruit, vegetables, nuts and seeds. She also began practising yoga and believes it has helped her to reduce negativity and accept herself. She has just finished a full  days of consuming absolutely nothing but water and believes that this keeps her feeling and looking young. Nicola said: I started a hairdressing apprenticeship at the tender age of , thataposs when the toxic le began. I was a smoker and drinker party girl. I never did drugs though, just mainly alcohol binges with my friends. I was always very social.    Then I started to change my le around. When I turned , I started training for fitness competitions to get fit and lean again. Around this time, I learnt to eliminate things out of my le that I knew were simply no good for me, like drinking, late nights, bread and sugar etc. Although this took a few years as I was yo-yoing from one thing to the next. Before falling pregnant with my first daughter I was binge eating. Iaposd starve myself all day then only want sugar foods. Iaposd always feel bloated and sick. Once I found out I was pregnant I changed quickly to put my growing baby first. That changed everything. But in  her world was turned upside down when she went through a orce.  She said: The orce was terrible. There were complications that took a lot longer to heal than I would have or could have predicted. However today this has become a foundation for clear thinking and transformation. I stumbled upon yoga when I was  and it slowly helped pull me out of tall hose negative patterns and self-hate about my body and I learned to fully love and accept myself. I even became a yoga teacher. Water fasting began in . Towards the end of March , I had dinner with a friend, and it was coated with chickpeas which I know are bad for my blood type, type B positive. I hadnapost been sick in years, but I had stomach pains and my stomach was terribly bloated. So, I decided to do a  day water only fast to heal my body. Nicola says that fasting is not without its dangers and should not be performed by people with certain conditions.  She stated: Fasting is not for everyone andyou donapost have a healthy relationship with food, have Bulimia or Anorexia, are pregnant, or have type I or II diabetes you should not undergo fasting. If you fast then you can expect increased energy, clarity of mind, less cravings, improved digestive system, clearer skin, clear eyes, feel joyful, have renewed cells, feel rejuvenated, defy ageing, eliminate inflammation, lose weight and starve off cancer cells. I believe that fasting is not a fad, but it is the future. Some women think Iaposm extreme but then others are asking why I am always smiling and how I looks so good and young after having two children. But experts warn that water fasting is very unhealthy. Dr Sarah Jarvis told The Sun : “There is absolutely no evidence that starving yourself makes you look younger.“In fact, extreme dieting can lead you to lose tissue under the skin of the face, making you look older. “It can also weaken your immune system and leave you with vitamin and mineral deficiencies.Nicola now runs detox retreats in Bali, Indonesia and she uses Instagram to educate and inspire her followers. She is currently writing her fourth book on water fasting and detoxing.I facilitate detox retreats in Bali helping lead people through what helped me years ago, detoxing with raw vegan plant-based foods. And Now embracing water fasting has taken my health knowledge and body to greater heights, Nicola said. I should also mention that this isnapost just for girls. Iaposve had a large increase in men reaching out to me on Instagram asking for advice about health and detox. Men in their thirties are ready to make a change. A recent client changed his le and lost kg in just six weeks. My key advice for anyone wanting to make permanent and positive changes to take things slow. Reduce things one by one, little and often. If you decide to fast remember that the key reason should not be to lose weight. I feel amazing, my energy is sustainable all day. Iaposm more positive and balanced and I continue to grow and evolve. You can have all these things too.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

But Auchinleck Estate is carving its own niche in tourism. And its history is every bit as fascinating as nearby Dumfries House Estate. You could argue that renowned biographer James Boswell elevates Auchinleck to even greater signicance than its neighbour. The Boswells had been at Auchinleck for  years before the two rival Georgian ‘big hooses’ were built in the s. “The original Auchinleck House, now a ruin, dates from ,” says historian Billy Cooper. “James IV gave Thomas Boswell the land, but the pair of them were to die together at Flodden in . “There’s an even earlier castle on the estate, and we’re hoping to locate a medieval graveyard.” Billy, , from Ochiltree, along with others, has founded a Friends of Boswell group of volunteers. “It’s a gem of a place –unchanged for centuries, and I just love the history of it all,” he says. Retired policeman Billy has been a guide at Culzean Castle and Dumfries House –but Auchinleck Estate excites him even more. “There’s gothic bridges over gorges, there’s a grotto, and there’s lots more to discover. “When Dr Johnson travelled here in , he had hardly seen a tree since Carlisle, and was impressed with planting done at Auchinleck,” said Billy. Rory Boswell, who runs the farm on Auchinleck Estate, is delighted to have the friends’ group on board. He said: “Since childhood, I’ve loved this wild, rustic place. “We’re the Boswells, we live here, we farm here, we’re still here.” Rory, , recounts a story of two old men, in their s, who used to make tea at the spring, when he was just a lad. He said: “There’s clearly health benefits to people enjoying access to the estate.” The friends are helping to restore gardens and walks that can be enjoyed by all. Rory said: “I have a brother in the army, so I’m pleased that groups like Combat Stress are getting involved.” He is rearing magnicent Highland Cattle, and hopes that one day there will be a steak restaurant alongside the very popular Boswell’s Coach House. Volunteer Mari Welsh, from Auchinleck, says she gets a great feeling of health and well-being from being on the rugged estate. She said: “Boswell was a great writer, and we in the friends group believe we are writing new chapters in the story. “We’re gradually improving the paths and the garden, and we hope tomarshes to ponds.” Mari’s brother, Craig Ferguson, has sketched out ideas of what the estate could become, with enhancements. “There’s so much potential here,” he says. “It’s a truly beautul place on our doorstep.” The friends group are launching guided walks of Auchinleck Estate on Sunday, May . These will leave from the car park at Boswell’s Coach House at .am and .pm.

reassess the regionrsquos CCTV networks, following news it is being allowed to fall into disrepair.Recently, council officers reported that the CCTV network is ldquono longer fit for purpose.And it was revealed that neither the local authority nor the police can afford to install and maintain the security systems.Currently,  of the councilrsquos  CCTV cameras dont work, and that number is likely to increase in the coming months and years.Now, Tweeddale East councillor, Stuart Bell, has put forward a motion for the local authorityrsquos next meeting, asking officers to produce a list of options for revitalising the failing CCTV network.He said: ldquoEffective public CCTV can make a positive contribution to community safety which is primarily the responsibility of the police but one in which the council has an obvious part to play.ldquoHowever, the capability of the system now operating in Border towns has deteriorated.ldquoWhilst there are limited budgeted council funds to invest in the current CCTV system, and whilst there will be advantages in opening up opportunities for communities to participate in the definition of what is needed, any decisions need to be based on a quantied assessment of costs.ldquoI ask officers to prepare a report showing the costs and options for renewing or replacing existing public CCTV for each community with a CCTV system to make that information part of a consultation with area partnerships, community planning partners and the police, fire and rescue, and safer communities board, before bringing forward a final report for consideration by this council.ldquoFurther to this that officers bring a report to the next Council meeting with a consultation plan, including whether outside resources will need to be brought in, the cost of consultation and a timescale for that consultation and final report to be brought to council.There are eight systems, all of which are operated by Police Scotland, in Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Kelso, Melrose, Peebles and Selkirk.Scottish Borders Council is currently spending pound, a year repairing the systems, and officers have advised councillors that this will continue until the CCTV cameras are ldquobeyond economic repair.Police Scotland have also confirmed that although they view the CCTV systems as a valuable resource, they will not be providing funding for their maintenance.Hawick and Hermitage councillor Watson McAteer has thrown his weight behind the motion.He said: ldquoCCTV plays a vital role is helping prevent and solve crime and I find it completely incomprehensible that decisions that impact the safety, health and well-being of our communities can be taken without a full and complete assessment of the consequences.ldquoOnly this week we have learned how CCTV has helped detected a serious crime in one Borders town.ldquoThis motion follows a refusal of the councilrsquos chief executive to allow the original report to be procedurally

cyclists.Several Borders bobbies have saddled up as part of the nationwide campaign.Operation Close Pass was launched after research found many drivers are unaware that by passing to close to a cyclist, they can gain up to three points on their licence.Police will ditch the unorm and don bike-mounted cameras in attempt to catch drivers who get too close for comfort over the coming weeks.They will radio aheada driver passes too close and offenders will be pulled over for a warning.Inspector Richard Latto of the Lothians and Scottish Borders Road Policing Unit said: ldquoThe safety of all road users, especially those in the vulnerable category, remains a priority for Police Scotland and Operation Close Pass is one way we can educate and inform road users of the necessary passing space for cyclists.ldquoRural roads can present additional challenges, such as changing road conditions, dferences in speed limits, narrower roadways and changes in weather conditions.ldquoWersquod encourage all road users to share the road space responsibly whilst adhering to appropriate speeds within the limits.With  official bicycle routes in  locations, it is clear to see why cyclists love the Scottish Borders.However, they cannot always hear traffic behind them due to rushing wind and accidents can easily occurmotorists donrsquot respect the highway code.Gary Robson, owner of Bspoke cycles in Peebles, told us that close passing is a frequent hazard for cyclists.He said: ldquoImagine that the bike you are about to pass is a mother with a pram or a horse and rider.ldquoYoursquore going to slow down and show respect by passing at a safe enough distance.ldquoWhen drivers start to think of bike riders as sons, daughters, parents, grandparents and not just as bikes then we will all be able to share the road safely.Police Scotlandrsquos recent survey found  percent of people asked were not aware that close passing was a practice resulting in three penalty points.Consisting of over  Scottish men and women the poll showed most were unaware of the consequences of failing to leave a carrsquos width of space when overtaking a cyclist.In the Scottish Borders cycling accidents occur fairly regularly on Borders roads - and there have been fatalities in the past decade.Cyclists in groups have taken to riding two a breast on the road in order to use up the same space as a vehicle forcing the motorists to slow down and wait until it is safe to overtake.This method has not been free of criticism however as motorists often find it dficult to overtake two cyclists safely rather than give one bike more room.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoThe Scottish Borders welcomes tens of thousands of cyclists every year who are here to enjoy some of the best on and off-road cycling that Scotland has to offer.ldquoAs well as local cyclists and cycling groups, we fully support Cycling Scotland and Police Scotland in raising awareness of the risks to riders and the penalties for drivers who overtake too closely.\"Belles on Bikes is a Scottish initiative set up for women to cycle together socially.They have  independent groups across Scotland run by volunteers who are passionate about helping women enjoy cycling and feel safe.One member of the Scottish Borders branch is Brenda Mitchell, a senior partner at Cycle Law Scotland, which is based in Peebles.Brenda told us: ldquoClose passing is incredibly dangerous and there is a huge need for the campaign in every region of Scotland.ldquoOne incident springs to mind involving an elderly male who was overtaken by an HGV far too closely catching the cyclist with the backdraft resulting in him crashing and injuring his clavicle.ldquoWith those incidents you have to remember the highway code as a motorist must give as much room to a cyclist as they would a car.ldquoIt is a super initiative as it focusses on educating drivers as cycling in the Borders has become such a popular activity.ldquoHowever, I find the drivers in the Borders more courteous on average, as most leave the acceptable distance when overtaking.ldquoAs cycling is so big in the Borders, many drivers know how it feels to be on both sides of the wheel and take the necessary steps to make cyclists feel safe.ldquoRespecting one another when sharing road space is key as cyclists also have a duty to be courteous towards drivers.With the tenth year of the TweedLove Bike Festival next month, and Tour orsquo the Borders ing for a third year, cycling tourism in the Borders is continuing to grow.Thanks to Border Buses and the Borders Railway becoming accessible for bike users, people from all over Scotland can travel to the Borders for a dayrsquos cycling in a more energy efficient way.Brenda added: ldquoAs people are becoming more aware of global warming issues, they know it is a good idea to cycle shorter distances instead of driving.ldquoHowever, many people are put off getting on their bikes

Finally, after what always seems a long wait, the land is alive and the evenings are long.The colours of this time are a big part of the joy. The blossom and explosion of wild flowers really lts my mood and spirit.A big part of this, for me, is the dandelion. Itrsquos a wild flower which decorates almost everywhere at the moment, creating a carpet of yellow which then transforms into white puffballs of flying lsquowishesrsquo.So many people just see this flower as an annoying weed to be mowed away as soon as it rears its head, but I love the way it keeps cheekily popping up in defiance of our attempts to keep nature at bay. Itrsquos one of our native wild flowers and causes no damage like some real invasive plants can, such as rhododendron.And they benefit our wildle so much. Bees and butterflies feed on them and some birds eat the seeds. But the benefits of the dandelion to humans has also long been recognised.A tea-like drink can be made from the roots and leaves or florets. There are dferent recipes, as the whole plant is edible. You can even make dandelion wine.The sap also contains healing properties which help with a range of ailments, especially skin complaints and issues related to digestion. In fact, herbalists will tell you of a range of health benefits attributed to the dandelion, which is packed with antitoxins and vitamins.And, of course, there are many folklore traditions associated with the flower.One I was reminded of this week when introducing the flower to a class of school children was the belief that you will wet the bedyou touch the petals! There is a small truth in this, as eating the leaves may have a diuretic effect.Making a wish and then blowing the parachute-like wisps which carry the seeds is the stuff of my childhood.Make the wish in secret and the wisps will carry it and help make it true. It is said they can also carry thoughts and love to someone you are missing or thinking about.Other uses include finding out how much you are loved, how many children you may have, or how many years you have left!The dandelion can even forecast the weather, as the puffball will close in on itselfit turns dreich. Another name for it is the lsquoshepherdrsquos clockrsquo, because its flower opens soon after sunrise and closes before the sun sets.And so this week I brought some dandelions into classrooms in a school where I am storytelling.Before I introduced the flowers, I gave them a riddle: ldquoA lion that has no roar, with teeth that do not bite, children who fly away, once yellow has turned to white. They eventually got the answer.The name dandelion, it is believed, comes from the French term lsquodent de lionrsquo meaning lionrsquos tooth, a reference to the teeth-shaped leaves.Then we blew the lsquowishesrsquo in the classroom. I was quite taken with the sense of wonder the children displayed . Many of them caught and kept the lsquowishesrsquo for later. It was so simple, yet so magic.ldquoHave you got more  I was asked.ldquoTherersquos plenty outside you can pick at home time, I told them.But as I left the school, I noticed the road verge I had picked the flowers had just been mowed. All the dandelions were gone, along with the other wild flowers, and it looked lsquonice and neatrsquo.Maybewe paused for a moment to wonder at how amazing this simple and common flower is, and the benefits it gives, we would have a dferent attitude towards it.Eating hand-picked and hand-washed dandelion leaves is one way my children will eat greens. If I mix them into a stir fry, they will be eaten too. These flowers are not just an irritating weed, they are one of naturersquos gts.As I left the school at the end of the day, a child came up to me.ldquoLook, I have a wish I caught, he said, as he carefully unfurled his hand. ldquoIrsquom going to use it to send my love to my granddad."},{"url":null,"title":"work-set-to-start-to-restore-dunbar-east-beach-to-its-former-glory","story":"The once-picturesque sandy beach has lost huge amounts of sand to the tides in recent years.Now, planning permission has been given for a scheme which aims to reinvigorate the beach, which used to be a magnet for tourists.Groynes, a breakwater and rock armour are included in the proposal, which was highlighted by ward councillor Norman Hampshire at a meeting of Dunbar Community Council.Mr Hampshire, the local authorityrsquos spokesman for environment, told the Courier: ldquoWe have been working on this project for some time, trying to get a method where we can attract sand back onto the beach again.ldquoThe consultants who have been looking at it have taken some time to come up with this option: a redesign of the groyne and two breakwaters to prevent [the damage caused] when we have a large sea coming in it damages the main wall and drags sand off the beach.

This was because I had never done it before. I canrsquot quite believe this myself that Irsquove left it to my late s to finally make the conquest.How many times I have said to myself, and my family, as we explored dferent parts of East Lothian, ldquowe must climb North Berwick Law someday as its distinctive shape loomed into view. Itrsquos a hill visible from so many places, just asking to be explored, but I always seemed to put it off. But finally I have done it.Itrsquos a huge pile of igneous rock, basically cooled and solidied lava, a remnant of ancient volcanic activity. Itrsquos a giant plug on a now-extinct volcanic vent. Folklore tradition has a very dferent origin for the hill, as I have already written about.When you stand at the base of the Law and peer up, you can see where the great glaciers of the Ice Age have scraped and polished the hillrsquos surface, making it quite rugged and craggy in places, and smoothed down in others. Itrsquos  feet high, not a mountain by any definition, yet still impressive. If it were in a hilly area we would notice the Law less, but it looms up from flatter landscape, right next to the sea, and so demands attention.No wonder it became a place of human settlement in the Iron Age period. How could you not use this hill as a location for a fort  Its steep, rocky braes are perfect for defence, itrsquos next to the sea with a ldquoview of the whole world, as my four-year-old put it ndash and was not entirely wrong!Cast your eye to the north and across the Firth was the land of the Picts. The open sea can be seen to the north east and almost the entire of East Lothian is laid out before you, to the Lammermuirs in the south and the Pentlands in the west.Here was the land of the Gododdin, the Celtic people who lived in our country when the Romans arrived, although they had a dferent name for them: the Votadini. They survived the Roman presence, perhaps entering into some alliance to preserve their tribe. The Romans were ruthless with those who did not co-operate and submit.But later, in the seventh century, long after the Romans had gone, the Angles arrived from the south. The Gododdin resisted the invasion. The great early poem Y Gododdin tells us of a great assemblage of warriors who feasted at Edinburgh before heading south to their deaths in battle.What wailing and sadness there must have been when the news of the loss of all those young, handpicked warriors arrived. The Goddodinsrsquo fate was soon sealed, the Angles took control of the land and the Lothians became part of the Northumbrian kingdom. The remnants of the disposed Gododdin migrated to Wales, it seems, taking with them their stories and legends of what became known as lsquothe old northrsquo.These were my thoughts as I found the remains on an old round house as we climbed to the summit of the Law. At first I wasnrsquot sure ndash it looked almost like a small standing stone circle ndash but on closer examination I realised the stones were the foundations of a Celtic round house. An archaeologist friend later confirmed this.There are at least  Iron Age round houses or similar structures so far discovered on the Law some are less obvious. Butyou carefully study the ground as you ascend, evidence of these ancient homes can be seen. There is also evidence of old walls or ramparts.So here a community of the Gododdin once lived. From their front doors they could see their sister forts of Dun Penderbut now named Traprain Law, and Din Eidyn, later to be called Edinburgh.So I entered the circle of stones as my kids played on a rock nearby. I was now in a space where once a family might have lived. It was not large, but then again, why would it be  It was a place to sleep and sit round the fire together. No need to make space for all the modern lsquonecessitiesrsquo of le. Their le would have been lived outdoors. But what stories were told in this intimate space, what lives were led, and when was the last night this was used as a home There is lots more to the history of North Berwick Law. The watch house from the Napoleonic period, the observation bunker from the Second World War and, of course, the whale bones, which are now made of fibreglass. All these connect to stories that make up the history of this fascinating wee hill.But for me on that day, it was the walk through prehistory, and the mysterious remains from an ancient Celtic people, that left my imagination tingling."},{"url":null,"title":"golfers-surprise-as-he-finds-guinea-pig-on-golf-course","story":"Engineer William Waddell, , was playing in the Lady Captainrsquos Day at the club in Prestonpans on April  when his friend hit a wayward ball on the ninth hole.Donna, Williamrsquos we, said: ldquoHe was looking for his friendrsquos ball when he saw something moving in the grass ndash he took a closer look and saw it was a guinea pig!ldquoHe picked it up and handed it in to the pro shop.The family put pictures of the furry find on Facebook and, in no time at all, a young girl came forward with her dad, another club member, to take care of it until the owner could be found.Donna added: ldquoThe dad happened to be an expert on guinea pigs, judging and showing them up and down the country, so they were the perfect people to take care of it really.ldquoWersquove all had loads of messages on social media from people offering to give it a home, so whatever happens, Irsquom sure itrsquoll be loved.William and Donna live in Duns with their two children Kiera, , and Jaydon, .Donna added: ldquoWersquore really keen to find out what will happen to the wee thing.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

However, four in five said it should be taught in a more engaging and interactive way.The lack of awareness of key historical events highlighted by the survey does not surprise Professor Murray Pittock, from Glasgow Universityrsquos School of Critical Studies.He said the importance of the study of Scottish history in schools had been eroded over the past  years.ldquoAwareness of Scottish history is poor generally. Before the Second World War it was quite a staple of the basic school curriculum, but that is no longer the case.ldquoThere is good Scottish history available the further you go up when people specialise in history in secondary school, but making sure everyone gets the basics is no longer a priority as it used to be.Mr Pittock said the trend dated back to what he described as a ldquoslow redefinition of British history in the s and s as not being about all the countries of the British Isles, but being more about English history ldquowith some bits on.ldquoIf you compare the Empire Exhibition of  with the Festival of Britain  the former has got quite a lot of independent coverage of Scotland and the latter does not.Read more:Schools in poorer areas of Glasgow not offering languagesldquoThe reaction to the end of the British Empire with more of a focus on an integrated narrative of who the British were, rather than an understanding of the multiple nations involved, had a lot of consequences from Walter Scott dropping off the curriculum in English schools to Scottish history taking a back seat in Scotland.Mr Pittock said the teaching of Scottish history increasingly became ldquoa matter of chance as the trend embedded itself through the work of key curriculum and exam bodies.ldquoThe general trend was that Scottish education absorbed the idea of a unitary British history and this was embraced by Scottish educational bureaucracy.In recent years, Scottish history has made something of a comeback. There is now a compulsory Scottish question in the history Higher and Scottish Studies has been introduced as part of the Curriculum for Excellence.However, Mr Pittock is concerned that for many people television and film still provides them with their understanding of their own history.ldquoOne of the reasons why there has been such a fuss about films like Braveheart is because it is the way too many people get their history.ldquoPeople should not get all their history through drama. Outlaw King happens to be academically advised and is done to a pretty high standard, but there are a lot of things in it you could question.ldquoA lot of these productions are not historically accurate. They are entertainment and liberties are taken with the facts so people are left with a  understanding.ldquoThe answer is to ensure the widespread teaching of Scottish literature and history in Scottish primary schools and in the early years of secondary school.ldquoBut one of the most important aspects of this is to stop making it a political issue asthis is a Nationalist agenda is totally wrong. It is not propaganda it is the history of Scotland and people should be learning about it in the same way people in other countries learn about and take ownership of their own history.Stuart Jarman, general manager of the Edinburgh Dungeon, said the attraction was conscious of the importance of teaching history in an ldquoentertaining and edgy way.He said: ldquoOur shows are based on solid historical research and we know from our visitors, including school groups and teachers, that they find this thrilling."},{"url":null,"title":"us-bid-to-oust-board-at-scots-bus-and-rail-giant","story":"Activist investor Coast Capital, which has built up its stake in FirstGroup to . per cent, has accused the current leadership of presiding over a ldquotrack record of value destruction and under-performance at the Aberdeen headquartered firm.:Transport giant faces demand for leadership cullAnd it raised the prospect of selling off parts of the group in order to ldquocreate value for shareholders, employees and pensioners.

The basis for a referendum was well-documented in .Askedit is, therefore, up to the UK Parliament to decide the limits of devolution, Mr Mundell tells The Herald: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the way in which you are construing that because devolution means that certain matters are the responsibility of the Scottish Parliament, so like education and health, these are almost a full responsibility.ldquoI put through orders in this Parliament to ensure that policies I donrsquot agree with in Scotland are in force free prescriptions, I didnrsquot agree with that policy at that time. I have put through the orders in this Parliament in relation to devolved matters even though I donrsquot agree with them because I accept the Scottish Parliament has responsibility. On the constitution, it is a matter that is reserved to the Westminster ParliamenthellipldquoThe Scottish Parliament is entitled to express an opinion and a view in relation to other matters but it is not the definitive view of Scotland.The Cabinet minister explains how the nature of devolution means it has limits. ldquoI have never suggested devolution is independence itrsquos not.

All of these additional powers and responsibilities it is taking on or will eventually take on, when the Scottish Government can get round to dealing with them, we need to see that dferentiation so people think the Parliament is dferent from the people who are running the Government.The Scottish Secretary admits that the Conservatives, who vehemently opposed devolution before the  referendum fearing a Yes vote could break up the Union, should have been quicker to accept the new settlement, which was voted for by nearly  per cent of Scotland on a  per cent turnout.He claims the Tories made a ldquoperfectly legitimate case in opposing devolution but ldquoonce it had become clear it was the settled will of the Scottish people, that it was going to happen, it would have been better to have accepted that earlier.:Sir John Curtice: Devolution was supposed to kill nationalism stone dead - its very much aliveMr Mundell, who has held his Cabinet post since , goes on: ldquoI always pay tribute to David McLetchie[the late Scottish Conservative leader] because what he did was as a leader he took us into that Parliament and acted in a combative but a constructive way and the  Tory MSPs who were elected in  and all their successors have always embraced and worked for that Parliament and for devolution. Once the referendum decision had been made, they completely put behind their previous position.The -year-old MP for or Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale makes clear Holyrood has now established itself as part of Scottish le but its potential has been unfulfilled, not because of the Parliament itself but because of the governments since .ldquoThe initial Labour-Liberal Governments were dull they didnrsquot take any risks really in terms of what they did.

But anything that takes account of the fact that three Bs from a socially disadvantaged child who cares for a sick parent might be worth the same as three As from a wealthy child whose parents invested in ongoing tuition has got to be a positive step on the road to social equality.Or so you would think. The problem is that some private-school parents, who have paid through the nose to ensure their child can tap into the type of privilege an Oxbridge education iniably brings, have cried foul, blaming social engineering on behalf of those further down the hierarchy of power for their own child missing out.There is a clear irony in the idea that social engineering could be working against any student educated at an Oxbridge feeder school, when school ties rather than academic achievement have often been enough to secure places in the past. Even the chair of the Independent Schools Council admitted as much when he noted that ldquoindependent schools report that their marginal candidates no longer tend to get into Cambridge but their good candidates are as successful as ever. Heaven forbid that those bright enough,not rich enough, might be successful too.Such attitudes are nothing new, with members of dominant groups regularly playing the discrimination card when they feel minorities are encroaching on their patch. Back in  Jonathan Sumption, then a Supreme Court judge who got his own break in law thanks to the intervention of a family friend, huffed that measures to improve the woeful lack of gender ersity in the judiciary ldquocould have appalling consequences for justice because they might ldquomake male candidates feel that the cards are stacked against them. Similarly, the BBC faced accusations of discriminating against whites when, in , it sought to make its newsroom more representative of the population it serves by making a traineeship open to black, Asian or non-white ethnic minority applicants only.While those making such arguments say they fear that bright-enough rich kids and talented-enough white men will lose out to less-bright poor kids or less-talented minorities, what they really fear is that long-established power imbalances may be tipping out of their favour. For them, the prospect of equality is a scary one.It neednrsquot be. Just as no privately educated student smart enough to study at Oxbridge has anything to fear from a state-educated pupil who is smart enough too, no man cut out for high office needs be afraid of missing out to a woman who has also got what it takes. Thatrsquos the beauty of equality: it would make room for everyone deserving of a place.The problem with the knee-jerk reactions of those who fear losing out, those who cry discrimination from their established positions of power, is that it can have very real consequences for those who are already being discriminated against because the balance of power remains so unequal.Take Glasgow. Last week the city councilrsquos licensing committee threw out an application for a female-only taxi business on the basis that it would discriminate against men. Though the vast majority of taxis in the city are driven by men, a reality that some women find intimidatory, the council baulked at the idea of female passengers being able to choose only female drivers and female drivers being matched only with female fares.Committee convenor Alex Wilson, the SNP member for Cardonald, opposed the plan on the basis that ldquothe whole not picking up male passengers is a concern to me while, in a rare show of unity across the political ide, Conservative member Robert Connolly said the idea of a service run by women for women ldquois essentially sexism towards males.Their words shame them. Sexism, just like any other form of discrimination, works because one party - men - has more power than another - women. Some men choose to wield that power through sex attacks and violence, and it is not discriminatory for women to want to protect themselves from that.Sure it would be a pain for a man to have to wait a few minutes to catch a ride home, just like it would be galling for an Oxford-bound student to have to settle for Bristol University instead. But unless and until we live in a world where all things are equal, theyrsquore really not in a position to complain."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-says-orange-order-marches-past-catholic-churches-have-gone-on-too-long","story":"Ms McNeill said permitting theOrder, and other loyalist organisations marchpast Catholic places of worship had \"gone on too long\".Her comments come between two silent protests outside Catholic Churches on the route of marchesin Glasgows East End this week.Last weekend a silent demonstration was held outside of St Marys in Calton at the weekend, andanother isplanned by the group Call It Out at St Alphonsus Church on Saturday.

After her talk last weekend at the Boswell Book Festival at Dumfries House in Ayrshire, I heard she had encouraged her audience to wear their clothes at least  times before discarding them. Not for her a one-night stand with ball-gown or palazzo pants. Clothes are not just for Christmas, they are something with which to establish a relationship.At least one of her listeners was already on message. The journalist chairing Olumidersquos event was wearing a -year-old suit, which looked asshe had picked it off the shop peg that morning. Putting aside the fact that a lot of us would struggle to squeeze into something wersquod owned for so long, it was a timely reminder that while the extremes of fashion outlive their best-before date faster than a camembert, the finest clothes are timeless.If you are already thinking  outings is the least yoursquod expect, chances are you could not be called a peacock or bird of paradise. Most likely you are one of those thirled to a self-imposed unorm, be it office suit or jeans. Sadly, I am of that persuasion. When getting dressed I rarely dig below the topsoil or forage beyond the most easily-reached hangars or shoes. Clearly it was for people of this nature that Harris Tweed was invented. Thanks to Hebridean looms, the idea of buying something that will ldquosee me out still flourishes in certain quarters. Years ago, when my husband interviewed Jackie Collins ndash who was resplendent in scarlet-zipped jumpsuit ndash she took one look at his elbow-patched Harris Tweed jacket, by then approaching its st birthday, and said: ldquoThis is some kind of joke, right It would be nice to claim that the narrow field from which I select garments is an environmental and political statement, but that would be misleading. My wardrobe is a sorry depository, most of its contents languishing forgotten and unloved for years on end. Like half the population Irsquoll wear underwear until the elastic frays, but dressier items can lie in cold storage for months while I get used to their presence. One such purchase, a snazzy woollen jersey bought before Christmas, is folded in a protective bag, awaiting the clocks turning back this autumn. Irsquom just praying the moths havenrsquot by then invested in equipment capable of boring through plastic.Read more: Royal baby names ndash will it be a case of Harry the unready Regrettably, the dogged use of a capsule wardrobe is often not an indication of an eco-warrior or trend-setter but someone indferent to style. Either that, or a reluctant shopper. While I can admire beautul clothes and those who wear them, I loathe trying things on. I do have one or two lovely pieces, but they are usually bought on a whim, often on holiday, when I am window-shopping at ease. Back home, on the high street, I find the deed has to be done on the SAS principle of going in under cover, and getting out at top speed before anyone spots me and advances to offer help. In terms of potential misery, the idea of hiring a personal shopper for a couple of hours is up there with volunteering to visit Mars. You might think online purchasing is the answer, but thatrsquos about as effective as trying to hit a bulls-eye blindfolded.The advent of Snapchat and Instagram seems to have accelerated the trend of disposable fashion, especially in those with serious social lives. Yet when newspapers trumpet the reappearance of celebritiesrsquo previously-worn garb, what hope for the notion that itrsquos the person inside, not the costume itself, that matters  Changing attitudes to clothes, and their purpose, is the real challenge here.The biggest culprit in most wardrobes is the statement piece, bought for a special occasion, that has done service only once or twice. Even when borrowed by friends, itrsquos lucky to have five wears, let alone . To address this problem there are, of course, places that hire out occasion wear. Yet they are not a cure-all.

From reading the article on Mr Mundell it appears that his obsession with the perils of Scottish independence continues unabated and that he uses his interview as a  to, in the main, criticise Scottish governments of the last  years.At no point does our Scottish Secretary offer to discuss contributions made to our devolved assembly by the Scottish Conservative Party. That is because, in short, there are none.From being initially termed a \"pretendy parliament by the London-based Billy Connolly, our Scottish Parliament has matured and acquired a gravitas that iniduals like Mr Mundell, blessed as he is with a limited proactive imagination, could never foresee taking place. The Scottish Parliament has instilled a tangible sense of self-belief in young Scots who were told for generations that all the decisions about the future of our country had to be made in London. Though Scottish Conservatives and their supporters will not admit it, the days of Scotland being dismissed as an outpost or defined as a region of England have gone. For the first time in modern Scottish history, devolution has forced us to take ourselves seriously within the United Kingdom and to contemplate where self-empowerment could lead us in the future.Mr Mundell and the Scottish Conservatives are stuck in a rose-tinted, jingoistic past of their own creation. Scotland is a young, modern and inclusive country which now looks to the future with promise. In no small measure this is thanks to devolution.Owen Kelly, Stirling.WHY would a Scottish Secretary of State support a Prime Minister determined to take Scotland out of the EU when the Scottish people voted to remain Dave Biggart,Kilmacolm.TWENTY years after its creation, the Scottish Parliament can justiably claim to offer a better model than its Westminster counterpart with its outdated, antagonistic culture and archaic rituals cruelly exposed these past three years. However, that is setting the bar too low for effective comparison.The Scottish Parliament has brought decisions closer to the people, provided some defence against ill-judged austerity and introduced some progressive policies such as the smoking ban, the drinks container deposit scheme now being introduced and others. On the debit side however, it has merely replaced the centralisation of London with the centralisation of Edinburgh and of power. It is proving increasingly timid and even regressive in forging new policies, for example, continued priority to roads investment, the resistance to reform of local taxation and others.Since all politics is local, the fact that my own community, Levenmouth has suffered steep relative decline over these two decades, the tough conclusion is that our devolved parliament has not actually worked for left-behind areas. It really must try a lot harder.Neil Stewart, Buckhaven.THE Tories in Scotland appear to be two parties with only a dislike of the SNP in common. The Scottish Unionists have maxed out in their appeal to the electorate as devolution progresses and IndyRef is kicked into the long grass. The Scottish Conservatives remain cowed and unable to put forward their more progressive policy slate as the Unionists resist the necessary step of removing fealty to the UK party.So as the SNP again declines more powers for the Scottish Parliament, the Unionist approach is predictable criticism of the SNP. The Scottish Conservative approach would be to push for full VAT revenuesto be assigned to Scotland so that the Scottish people can enjoy the benefits of such with a growing economy under the Scottish Conservatives. The Scottish Conservative approach would be to recognise that Scotland has a terrible demographic profile and to immediately use the available welfare powers to encourage a higher birth rate. The Scottish Conservative approach would be to push for the immigration quotas necessary to sustain the Scottish economy.The lack of imagination by the dominate Unionist forces still cleaving to a Union that no longer exist in reality means an independent Scottish Conservative Party will be born out of a reaction to the coming drubbing in the European elections or reduced votes from the mortality of its supporter demographic. The alternative is to pro-actively create a Scottish centre party that puts Scotland first amongst equals. Better to lead in accepting the inevitable.James Robb,Helensburgh.Read more: Holyrood does not express definitive view on Scotlands future, David Mundell insistsDR Gerald Edwardsexaggerates the relative strengths of the Liberal Democrats and the Greens in the  Scottish Parliamentary election. In the votes for the regional members the Greens had more than six per cent of the vote while the Liberal Democrats had just more than five per cent of the votes. It would appear to me that on this occasion the six seats secured by the Greens compared to five seats secured by the Liberal Democrats was a fair reflection of the relative positions of each party.The huge majority that Dr Edwards claims for the Liberal Democrats over the Greens only arises in the constituency votes, and can be attributed to the fact that the Greens were on the ballot paper in only three constituencies. Indeed it is quite possible that many supporters of the Green Party would have voted for the Liberal Democrats in the constituencies where there was no candidate for the Green Party.Unless a party is going to secure  or more out of the  first past the post constituency seats then it is the regional votes that they have to concentrate upon in order to ensure success over their opponents. The Greens have largely dispensed with the constituencies since they do not have the critical mass of voters in any of the constituencies to make successful challenges.Sandy Gemmill,Edinburgh, EH.APPARENTLY the SNP is concerned its botched mailshot, and yes I got one, might annoy older voters .

Fergusson and deputy presiding officers Trish Godman and Alasdair Morgan are pictured with the July , , babies who visited Parliament for its th birthday. It is hoped they willfor the th celebrations. “But it was a joyful day the crowds turned out in force and we had the weather to go with it. “I was able to enjoy it once the hard work was done.“I remember walking down the Royal Mile, once the crowds had dissipated. Even then, I realised it was a once in a letime day.”There are many memorable occasions Paul can recall but one meeting in particular stands out.“There was a breakfast meeting attended by Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley,” he said. “Martin helped Ian to his feet and they walked across the garden lobby of the Parliament together.“As someone who followed Irish politics, I had to pinch myself. For that to have happened here in the Scottish Parliament – it’s a tremendous memory.“It was so symbolic and a reminder that even the strongest adversaries can come together.”One act of legislation is also lodged in Paul’s mind.“When the same sex marriage act was passed, there was a sense of jubilation in all parties and across Parliament,” he said.In his  years, Paul has been invited to breakfast at Bute House just once.But that breakfast will also live long in his memory.He added: “In , I was responsible for helping to run the referendum which saw the Parliament being re-established in Scotland.“It was a day of great anxiety but it had gone well, with only a few technical hitches – in a time when a fax machine was state of the art!“I finished work at am and got invited to Bute House for breakfast with Donald Dewar, Henry McLeish and Sam Galbraith.“One of my best memories is enjoying breakfast with them, while reflecting on what had been a great night for them politically and a great night for us too.“I’ve never been invited back for breakfast since – but you never know, it is the th anniversary this year!”The Parliament’s current presiding officer Ken Macintosh was one of the newbies in .Until being elected to represent Eastwood in , he was a BBC television producer, working on national news programmes.But encouraged by his we Claire, he sought election to the Parliament as a Labour Party candidate.Despite claiming not to be a career politcian, he was re-elected in ,  and . And in  he was elected as an MSP for West Scotland and became Presiding Officer.The eldest of their six children, Douglas, is  this month so  was a busy year for the Macintosh clan!He recalled: “It was a very exciting time in my le. “Claire and I had just got married a year before and our son was born five days before I was elected.“So it was exciting but slightly worrying as my we thought she’d married this sensible man, with a senior position in the BBC.“Then suddenly I was giving it all up for politics. “At the time, it was a little bit of a gamble from someone who is not a gambler!“But Claire encouraged me to stand. That was all the endorsement I needed.”Ken was more used to posing questions than being asked them but it was a relatively easy transition.He explained: “Whether it is reporting on current events or trying to shape them, it’s a reflection of the same set of interests.“I’d been a member of the Labour Party since I was a student but never, ever stood for an elected office.“But I was a big supporter of devolution and it was really that that made me put myself forward.“The whole idea of doing politics in a dferent way, having a erse group of voices, that was what grabbed me.“I used to be the person shouting questions at the Prime Minister which stood me in good stead. To become the person being shouted at was quite odd though!”Ken recalls the early days with great pride.“It’s dficult for people now to recall the air of excitement it was an era of real change,” he said.“Then there was a big backlash due to the cost of the building and politically some very dficult issues.“Section  was the one I remember very vividly. It was a confrontation of the old Scotland with the new.“The Scotland I was brought up in was not the tolerant, progressive country it is today...it was certainly not an easy country to be gay in.“Section  confronted that head on.”Another milestone for Ken was the smoking ban.“When I was a kid, people always talked about Scotland having the worst cancer record in Europe,” he said.“And here we were taking control of our own health.“We were criticised for being the nanny state but I still think of it as a statement of our self-confidence.“When I first started, the Parliament made videos and I was asked what my ambitions for Scotland were and who my heroes were. “My heroes were Kenny Dalglish and Elvis Presley. I’ve since met Kenny and he didn’t disappoint!“I also wanted Scotland to be more self-confident and the smoking ban was a sign of that.”Now,  years on, the Parliament has become the centre of public le.Ken added: “At the start, so many people were openly hostile and condescending about the Parliament. “It’s testament to the people of Scotland that they’ve since embraced it and made it their own.”Tracing babies who share Parliament’s birthdayA new exhibition will take centre stage in the Parliament for the th anniversary celebrations. It will feature many of the ordinary people who have had an impact on the Parliament during its -year history. Ken said: “We are always trying to find new ways of engaging with the public and, in many ways, that’s what the exhibition and the th anniversary is all about.”The community and engagement unit is also trying to track down the babies who were born on July , .The youngsters share their birthday with the Parliament and were a big part of the th anniversary. The hope is that they can all be reunited on Saturday, June , for the th birthday party.For more information on events, visit www.parliament.scot.

We have to look at this on the basis of the outcomes, not processes and will the Minister not accept that for the over s, the outcomes look pretty grim.”Responding on behalf of the Government, Margot James MP said: “I thank the Rt. Hon. Gentleman for his intervention and I am sure that the BBC will listen to the comments which he just made with which I have considerable sympathy. This was part of a fair deal for the BBC. At the time the BBC Director General, and I have already quoted him, that he did say also that it was a strong deal for the BBC and that it provided financial stability.”Adding further comment, Mr. Carmichael said: “It is easy to say you are sympathetic but still the Government is doing nothing to set it right. They have tried to duck responsibility by pushing it onto the BBC, but this is not about who is responsible, but what the impact is on the people who will be affected.“Over s are often on a low fixed pension, so to suddenly have an extra £ outgoing is a huge chunk of their income. Many older people are reliant on their TVs as a way of avoiding loneliness and stripping them of their TV Licence is likely to leave signicant numbers unable to watch their favourite programmes.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The strike action will last for  hours seeing Kirkwall Airport close to air traffic.

There will be local support for farmers, who will be able to obtain immediate permission rather than having to apply for a specic, inidual licence, which can take around ten days.This local licence follows a new goose policy which supports efficient, practical regulation for farmers and others affected by geese grazing.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles  North Highland area manager, has said: “We realise that farmers in Orkney have been struggling with the impact of large goose numbers, and this pressure has been increasing. We’re keen to work with farmers and land managers and support them in finding sustainable solutions to managing this problem, while still making sure we fulfill our nature conservation obligations.“We have been working hard to look at ways to give farmers more flexibility. As a result, we plan to introduce a greylag goose licence for Orkney to cover the closed season from  February to  June.“For the long term, we will also be working with an extended local Goose Management Group, alongside partners in NFUS, RPID and others, to try to explore new ways of managing the problem. We will be funding and administering this through the local goose management group in Orkney.”SNH have been discussing potential management tools and the new licence with NFU Scotland representatives in Orkney. Alan Corrigall, chairman of the Orkney Branch, said: “We are grateful to SNH for making the changes that will allow shooting to take place throughout the year, where necessary. Whilst the new licence will not control geese numbers in itself, it will make much easier for those undertaking shooting to get the necessary consent between February and June.#We also look forward to working with SHN and others as we explore other ways to reduce the resident greylag goose population to lessen the environmental and economic impact of the huge numbers of geese.#Resident greylag geese in Orkney have increased over the past  years.

It is an information gathering and assessment exercise which helps stakeholders, the public and the planning authority understand the potential environmental impacts of major development proposals.The Orkney Community Wind Farm Project could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney, say the council.Plans for a development of up to around MW in Hoy were announced to the local community last year — with sites for a development of up to MW on the island of Faray and up to MW on shoreside farmland at Quanterness outside Kirkwall now also being investigated.The scoping report for Faray is available at here. The scoping report for Quanterness is available at here.Councillor James Stockan is leader of Orkney Islands Council. He said: “We are keen to keep the public informed on this project as it develops. Our well-attended consultation events were very useful, and allowed a range of views and opinions to be expressed and we’re looking forward to carrying out a further event in Westray in June.#Once all the information events are complete, we’ll be looking to provide more online information on the project and in the meantime I’d encourage folk to take a look at the scoping reports for detailed information.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Alternative arrangements to the backstop won easily whilst everything  has failed.ldquoFor the Bill to have any prospect of success then there must be real change to protect the economic and constitutional integrity of the United Kingdom and deliver Brexit.After a marathon Cabinet meeting earlier on Tuesday, ministers agreed to continue the cross-party efforts to break the impasse but stressed it was ldquoimperative for a Brexit deal to get through Parliament by the summer recess.With Theresa Mayrsquos future linked to the passage of a Brexit deal, getting legislation through the Commons and Lords by the summer break could also pave the way for her departure from Number .Ministers spent more than two hours discussing the Brexit situation and despite the apparent lack of progress in talks with Labour decided the process should continue, but with a clear view that ldquowe need to get a move on.The Withdrawal Agreement will go before the Commons in the same week US President Donald Trump is due to make a state visit to the UK.Mr Trump and his we Melania will be in the UK from Monday June  to Wednesday June .On Thursday June , a by-election will be held in Peterborough to find a replacement for MP Fiona Onasanya, who lost her seat through a recall petition after serving time in prison for lying about a speeding offence.copy -.

Otherwise, what’s the point So the current debate over whether the normal urban speed limit should be mph or mph is a matter of degree, rather than principle. Where should the compromise between safety and speed be made The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, which supports mph, points to research saying that  per cent of pedestrians killed in accidents with cars and vans died when the impact speed was less than mph, while just five per cent of deaths occurred below mph.However, other research found that an astonishing  per cent of car drivers break the speed limit on mph roads, compared to  per cent on mph roads, which gives a fairly good indication of what most motorists think about the lower limit.: ‘Very harsh’ – Edinburgh reacts as  drivers caught breaking mph limitAs we report today, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said in a letter to the charity Sustrans: “Changing a speed limit does not guarantee that actual vehicle speeds will change. The guidance on setting all speed limits is clear that they should be reasonable and consistentthey are to be credible to road users and obeyed as a result.”If a law is introduced, but not obeyed by a large number of people, then it risks being held in general contempt and simply ignored. The laws requiring the wearing of seatbelts and banning smoking in pubs were initially controversial, but were successful because they quickly became accepted as people realised they were actually beneficial.The signs from places such as Edinburgh where mph limits have been introduced are that there is considerable resistance to the idea. Police Scotland has also pointed out that enforcing this limit cannot be a priority for the force. A mph speed limit on some city streets may be appropriate, but it is clear the public still needs to be convinced.: Catching mph speeders ‘not a priority’ – Police Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"well done to snp for this great pro climate move dr richard dixon","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Last week#s decision to scrap the plans to first halve and then do away with Air Departure Tax was a great move in the right direction and exactly the kind of thing a country which has delcared a #Climate Emergency# should do.The airport industry whinged on, of course, but failed to mention there is no VAT on plane tickets and no tax or duty on aviation fuel – unlike the trains they compete with for UK and near-continent journeys. Flying is a growing contributor to climate change. Oneflight to the US creates about the same amount of climate pollution per passenger as the gas used to heat a house for a whole year. Reducing your consumption of meat and dairy produce and stopping flying are the two biggest things most of us can do to reduce our own personal contribution to climate change. Globally, the aviation industry is growing rapidly and is predicted to reach four times today’s climate emissions by . New planes are generally more efficient than older ones but growth in flights outstrips efficiency improvements by some distance, and many planes operate for  years before coming out of service.Fortunately we already include international flying in measuring our climate emissions and therefore in climate targets, although the current rules under-estimate the contribution of aviation by a factor of at least two.Some argue that businesses need cheap flights but, when asked, most businesses say they expect their employees to do less flying in the future. The businesses save money and get more productive time out of their staff, and the employees get to see more of their families.: Air tax: Scotland’s direct air link to China faces axeSome argue that tourism will sufferwe do not make flights cheaper. Tourism is doing pretty well already, with employment in the tourism sector growing by  per cent between  and . And cheaper flights might bring a some more people here but they will also encourage more people from Scotland to spend their holiday money somewhere .Unlike for cars, there is no easy technical solution in sight to make most flying low or zero carbon. There are some electric planes and Norway has a target to use electric planes for all short-haul flights. But that’s going to take until  and will still only be for short flights.There are those who suggest we can use fuels made from crops for flying, but replacing all that fossil aviation fuel with plant-based alternatives would hoover up vast areas of the world’s productive land and create a boom in already-destructive palm oil plantations.Keeping flying even as much as today would mean every other sector, from homes to farms, from factories to road transport, would have to reduce emissions even faster to meet climate targets. Youth climate activist Greta Thunberg’s makes very impressive speeches in a iety of languages all over Europe. She doesn’t fly, she takes the train. : Brian Wilson: Blowhard promises led to SNP’s air tax U-turnMany of the UK climate scientists who went to last year’s climate conference in Katowice made a point of going by train. The three of us from FoE Scotland who went also took the train. A growing number of people are shunning flying because of its impacts and there is a new no-flying movement in Sweden.Scrapping the scrapping of the Air Departure Tax was a great pro-climate decision. Very well done to the SNP for making it and defending it robustly. But it needs to be only the start of a change in our travel habits when it comes to flying.Dr Richard Dixon is director of Friends of the Earth Scotland©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

We have the worst levels by a country mile.Figures assembled by the debt relief charity Step Change indicate that while the average Scottish mortgage debt is £,, in the constituency of Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch it is a whopping £,.Even within the Highlands as a whole that is a shocking sum # the Highland average of mortgage arrears is £,. That is almost twice the national average. But in Skye, we are told, our arrears are six times the national average, with almost a third of mortgage payers affected.We should introduce a note of caution. Step Change has extrapolated its conclusions from a small sample of the population. It is possible,not likely, that things are not quite that bad.Unless Step Change is completely off the chart, things are nonetheless bad enough. And our indebtedness extends beyond house payments. The Highlands and Islands have the highest levels of electricity bill arrears in Scotland, something which will be owed to our climate and our extortionate bills, and which has already been advertised by our uniquely high levels of fuel poverty.Overall, people in the Highlands and Islands are twice as much in debt as where in Scotland, and people in the north-west of Scotland are even more in hock to lenders and to utility companies.Those astonishingly high figures for mortgage debt # and therefore, of course, of potential foreclosures and homelessness # in this region cannot easily be explained away. It is the result of a combination of factors.House prices in Skye and the western Highlands began to rise, from a low base, in the s.The speed of growth took everybody by surprise. A simple crofthouse which in the early s might have sold for £, or less can now fetch ten times that amount.The selling price was dictated more by location than the quality of the property. At first the holiday home sector played the most active part in pushing up prices.Throw a st century tourist boom and all of its ancillary money spinners such as buy-to-let properties and Airbnb into the mix, add a resident population which has grown by  per cent since the s, and the result is a skewed and uncontrollable local housing market.It is a market into which local working people are obliged to enter. Everybody needs somewhere to live. Local housing associations have done a good job in offering affordable rented homes. Clearly, however, Skye and the north-west have never recovered from the Tory assault on local authority #council# housing in the s. In the absence of sufficient decent social housing, people have to buy.The result has been that young people, in particular, have been obliged to enter what is now one of the most expensive and volatile housing markets in the United Kingdom. Those same young people live in a region with some of the worst-paid and insecure jobs in the country.That is not a formula for a stable society. Low wages and high house prices, in a region where the general cost of living is also high, provides the perfect recipe for unsustainable levels of mortgage arrears, as well as unpaid electricity and other bills # and that is exactly what we have got.There are two obvious solutions. They will not be achieved overnight, but they should be pushed quickly up the agenda of all of our local businesses and elected representatives.It is clear that the tourism riches that have recently descended on Skye and the north-west are not evenly distributed. If we want people to stay and live and work here, they must be paid at least a living wage: a salary which will enable them to buy houses.And central and local government must invest much more in social housing. That will depend upon finance from the Scottish Government and the initiative of Highland Council. The £ million pledged this week by the former towards local authority housing is a good start. But there are  councils in Scotland. The money cannot be ided equally. Priority must be given to regions such as this which suffer most gravely from unaffordable housing.

The school building, which is situated by Loughbrickland Lake, was purchased by the council in  and leased to the Southern Trust in . The council is now looking at potential uses for when the current lease expires. Momentum gathered on the council’s facebook page when Charlene Redhead tagged several friends who had attended or had links with the old primary school and said: “Give this a read. Let’s have a say about how we use it next.”Angela Moffett replied: “What about an animal or wildle park  Archery range  Some form of children’s play centre  Laser Quest  A floating cafe bar  Some form of activity centre which the locals can enjoy and something that will bring people to the area.” There was a strong feeling that the old school should be used for something connected with children and their development, as that would be a fitting tribute to its past. Suzanne Ward said: “It definitely needs to be an activity centre for children and young people. The young people I work with love to explore outdoors and Belfast activity centre as they are fantastic facilities. I really hope they make proper use of what they have and not skimp on anything. There is so much potential.”Ruth Moffett said: “If the lake is included it should be for everyone to enjoy.”Suggestions also came in from other members of the public.

Just as people come to the Clonard Novena, my family would have gone to the St Majella Novena every year over the generations, it’s a church that I know very well and love.”Fr Kehoe spoke of how there is great goodness in people “wherever you go” and how much he will miss the people he has got to know since first arriving at  Clonard Gardens in .“Clonard is very much inserted in this community, their pride and love for it is something I haven’t experienced anywhere .“People have the same struggles and dficulties. I will really miss Clonard, miss the people I got to know here. When the changes were published they were a bit of a shock.“Clonard is a church and faith community like no other. The people of Clonard are amazing, they are the most generous people I’ve ever met, they would literally go out of their way to help you in anyway they could.“I spent seven years in Cork learning to say things without actually saying them, when I came to Clonard there were no back doors. It was lovely to work with that, you knew where you stood with people.”While the sterling work of Fr Kehoe at Clonard is well appreciated by the local people, he is keen to point out that it takes a considerable team effort for Clonard to work.“I’m not sure people really understand just how big it is. There are over  people involved in Clonard, from our ministries, readers, Eucharist Ministers. Clonard has become a very signicant place for music and our director Cathal Murphy has really pushed that with our choirs and opening up Clonard as a venue for concerts.“Clonard’s name is out there, when you have such a beautul and sacred place at your disposal there are people coming to Clonard for music that may have never been before.”With preparations gathering pace for next month’s eagerly-awaited Novena, Fr Kehoe says he will take with him forever the “phenomenon” that the annual June festival of prayer has become.“You have -, people a day coming into the area. People are coming with huge burdens, you can see by the end that they are leaving feeling healed, supported and feeling that God is very close to them in their lives. I think at some stage all of us need that.Paying tribute to the faith of the people of Clonard, Fr Kehoe says he was amazed to find when he arrived at Clonard that there were three Christmas Vigil Masses.“I remember saying, ‘You can’t do that’ but it was a case of wait and see. Seeing the church packed with young families, seeing that sense of pure joy in the church, well, I will take that with me everywhere.“I have a real deep feeling of gratitude for the way people have welcomed me, the faith of West Belfast Catholics is second to none and I want to thank them for all their love and support.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"darkness into light","story":"AHEAD of this weekend’s highly anticipated Darkness Into Light walk all participants are being asked to be aware of the important parking information.Hannahstown Community Association and Lámh Dhearg would like to advise that the Darkness into Light route will be closed to all traffic from .am to .am.A long stay car park is available at the Lámh Dhearg carpark and will be open to walkers runners from am on Saturday May  and operated on a first come first served basis until .am.

After a warm welcome at reception wemade our way to our Executive room on the hotel’s first floor. The room was extremely spacious with a huge bathroom – a welcome slate of fresh fruit and bouquet of flowers was a wonderful touch.Over a cup of tea we were able to see more guests arrive throughout the afternoon who were accessing the hotel’s popular apartments and it was a quick change before heading out for dinner at Malone Lodge’s Kne and Fork Grill and Deli. The hotel’s restaurant is beautully laid-out with burgundy leather banquettes and ornate glass cases containing antique cutlery. Our sitting was for .pm and already there was a buzz in the restaurant with both couples and families celebrating birthdays and other special occasions. Once settled we had a look over Malone Lodge’s All Day Menu, which is served both in the main restaurant and Macklin’s lounge. Light bites included soup of the day, classic Caesar salad, chicken wings and beetroot and goat’s cheese salad. My partner and I decided to start things off with two servings of the goat’s cheese, which was delicious – pearls of tangy goat’s cheese were perfectly dressed accompanied by a scattering of caramelised walnuts and leaves.We surveyed a mouth-watering menu but it was a dish of chicken and chorizo carbonara served with a wedge of garlic bread and rocket that won out, along with a fillet of salmon with cockles, carrots, celery and lemon persillade sauce. My salmon main was a plump fillet with crispy skin sat atop a mound of creamy mash, green beans, roasted parsnip and caullower. Across the table the pasta was hailed a success. Generous side portions of onion rings and sweet potato fries ensured we had no room for dessert, tea or coffee but opted for a drink in the lounge where we promptly sank into one of their luxurious Queen-sized armchairs and did something we hadn’t done in a while – relax.The hotel staff in Malone Lodge are at the top of their game when it comes to going above and beyond to ensure your stay is a memorable one. This was further demonstrated at a very busy breakfast service the next morning. Nothing was too much trouble as we were guided to bowls of fresh fruit, granola, juices and toast with the option on offer to opt for something cooked to order. Full Irish, porridge, scrambled eggs and homemade pancakes are there for the taking, but we opted for the muffin, bacon and avocado combination, which hit the spot along with pots of freshly brewed coffee and tea.Malone Lodge Hotel offers a first class experience from the minute you step into their reception, until, sadly, in our case, you check out and back to reality.The hotel is within walking distance of Queen’s University, Botanic Gardens and a host of other South Belfast attractions. We particularly enjoyed the café culture of the surrounding area. The hotel boasts its own private car park which is becoming something of a rarity these days and it’s a mre step out of the vehicle and in to the hotel.Malone Lodge offers the perfect stay to all and, for us, on this occasion, a memorable one.For more information visit Malone Lodge Hotel and Apartments at www.malonelodgebelfast or Tel:   "},{"url":null,"title":"carry your passport says man quizzed on belfast to dublin bus","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think it reflects well on the school, the pupils and the standards set by staff.\"Mr Skelton said the league table \"shows the success of the grammar school system\" and he added: \"Pastoral care is a massive part of it. We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

Meanwhile, US secretary of state Mike Pompeo conveyed President Donald Trump’s interest in restoring better ties.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Vladimir Putin said he hoped Russia’s relationship with the US would improve In the highest-level face-to-face contact between the two countries since special counsel Robert Mueller’s report was released last month, Mr Putin told Mr Pompeo he hoped relations with the US would now improve. Still, his claim of vindication covered only allegations that Russia and the Trump campaign colluded to hurt Hillary Clinton’s candidacy. Mr Putin did not address Mr Mueller’s conclusion that Russia actively interfered in the election.“However exotic the work of special counsel Mueller was, I have to say that on the whole he has had a very objective investigation and he confirmed that there were no traces whatsoever of collusion between Russia and the incumbent administration, which we said was absolutely fake,” Mr Putin said as he opened the meeting with Mr Pompeo in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.“As we said before there was no collusion from our government officials and it could not be there. Still, that was one of the reasons for the certain break in our inter-state ties,” he said. “I’m hoping today that the situation is changing.”Mr Pompeo did not specically mention election meddling in his brief reply to Mr Putin, although he did say the Trump administration would “protect our nation’s interest”. Earlier, though, Mr Pompeo made clear that any repeat of the  meddling would not be tolerated.“Interference in American elections is unacceptable,” Mr Pompeo told reporters at a news conference with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. Today, @SecPompeo met with #Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sochi. pic vcJMkqoC— Department of StateMay , “If Russia were to engage in that in , it would put our relationship in an even worse place than it is. We have encouraged them not to. We wouldn’t tolerate that. Our elections are important and sacred and they must be free and fair.”After meeting with Mr Putin, Mr Pompeo told reporters: “So it’s not about moving on. It’s about trying to find solutions, compromises, places where there are overlapping interests you can make progress unlocking some of the most dficult problems that are facing us.”Mr Putin told Mr Pompeo his recent telephone conversation with Mr Trump raised hopes for an improvement in relations.“As you know, not long ago, a few days ago, I had the pleasure of talking with the president of the United States by telephone,” he said. “For me, it created the impression that the president intends to restore Russian-American connections and contacts to resolve joint issues that present mutual interests.”Mr Pompeo spoke of “truly overlapping interests” that the two countries “can build on, and most importantly, President Trump very much wants to do that”. He cited co-operation in Afghanistan and counter-terrorism more broadly, but also a shared goal of getting North Korea to abandon nuclear weapons. But he also told Mr Putin that “just as you will, we’ll protect our nation’s interest”."},{"url":null,"title":"us secretary of state tells russia no more election interference","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections EU Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

These included Iran, Syria and Venezuela, where the United States supports opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president and Russia backs President Nicolas Maduro.Today, @SecPompeo met with #Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in Sochi. pic vcJMkqoC— Department of StateMay , Mr Lavrov defended Russia’s position and said the threats Mr Maduro’s government is receiving from US administration officials coupled with Mr Guaido’s seeming support for a foreign military intervention, “bear no relation to democracy”.Iran was a key point of discussion amid rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Last week, the United States sent an aircraft carrier and B- bombers to the Middle East in response to intelligence that Iran was planning attacks on American interests.“We fundamentally don’t seek a war with Iran,” Mr Pompeo said.Mr Lavrov said Russia is hoping for a positive response from the United States about extending the New START arms control treaty, which is due to expire in , “but we really have some concerns which are related to the re-equipping of launchers of Trident submarines and heavy bombers announced by the United States”.A day after US President Donald Trump said he would meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G summit of leaders in Japan in June, Mr Lavrov said it has not received a formal proposal.“If such a proposal is received, we will respond to it in a positive way,” he said.Mr Pompeo and Mr Lavrov were to brief Mr Putin on their talks in the evening.At the start of their meeting, Mr Lavrov said both countries are overdue to dispel “suspicions and prejudices” and to “start building a new constructive framework” of how Russia and the US see each other.My meetings in #Russia will highlight a number of important topics. On some issues we may agree, on others we may disagree, but when it’s in our national interests, it is our responsibility to find a way forward.— Secretary PompeoMay , Mr Pompeo said in televised remarks at the meeting that he came to Russia because Mr Trump was “committed to improve this relationship” despite dferences between the United States and Russia Syria, Iran, the crisis in Venezuela and other matters."},{"url":null,"title":"british government cannot allowed hide role conflict mccartney","story":"The British government is \"clearly still intent\" on covering up its role in the conflict after Britains information watchdog ruled that a report calling for the shakeup of the RUC would remain secret more than  years after it was written, Foyle MLA Raymond McCartney said.

Such a trail would link the arearsquos many tower houses, monasteries and other medieval sites. Local people are being invited to give their ideas on the trail and it might be enhanced through themed banquets, tapestry making, metal working, re-enactments, guided tours and other activities to encourage visitors to spend time in the area.This project is being supported and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Tourism NI and the Historic Environment Division of the Department for Communities. It has been developed as part of their European Year of Cultural Heritage programme.ldquoA medieval trail would leave a lasting legacy from the huge rise in visits to heritage sites used as Game Of Thrones locations, estimated by Tourism NI at , visitors in , and valued at pound million to the local economy, a spokesman for the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership said.ldquoThe Beyond Westeros Roadmap describes how political control was shared around  AD among  lordships of medieval Ulster and their stories played out around Dundrum Castle and other sites.ldquoThe project will also work with people, tour operators and tour guides, particularly in and around Downpatrick, to begin to establish medieval sites as cultural hubs within a network of linked sites.Iniduals, businesses, artisans and groups in Co Down will be invited to help develop medieval sites as cultural hubs for their community and for visitors.A portfolio of medieval stories and characters will be created to communicate to these cultural heritage tourists.This will enhance work already undertaken by Historic Environment Division to improve visitor access and community engagement with some sites in their care in the area, and they will be closely involved throughout the project..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Armstrongs at Limerick  ","story":"SUNDAY saw Sean and Teresa Armstrong take part in the Great Limerick  Mile Run mdash made even more enjoyable by a beautul sunny day and a lively musical warm-up which saw runners entertaining the crowd by displaying some dodgy dance moves with the dance troupe on stage.Race four of the Hill and Dale series took Team Mac to Slieve Binian for the lsquorace to the toprsquo.This is only race of the series to finish on a mountain peak and Binian certainly doesnrsquot show any mercy to the competitors.A field of  lined up on the Head Road on a glorious evening, Binian was looking majestic in the evening sunshine, but no runner was admiring the view, competitors were all just looking in shock at the gradient that lay before them.Paul Byrne was race director and quickly gave the race briefing before giving the field a very abrupt start.A fast sprint up the lane towards the quarry with runners fighting for position before the steep incline up beside the wall.At the quarry the field slowed to a walk as legs began to burn climbing the , feet to the peak. The welcome sight of the stile at the wall brings relief to the faces of many as it means the finish is merely a  metres away.Some of the runners had to queue to get over, which was a welcome rest as they all prepared themselves for the last leg burn up the steepest finish of the series with the finish right at the peak.Hugh Oram was initially leading Team Mac up the wall when he was comfortably passed by Sean Armstrong, who greeted him as he passed and then disappeared into the distance.Sean finished in st in :, Hugh was six places behind him, then Colm Devlin, Laura Lynch, Dave Fulcher, Barry Poland with Regine Candau hot on his heels, finishing only six seconds behind.Liam Smyth was next, then Catherine Scannell, with Michael Power just behind.

I had great help from the Laird family in the earlier days until my own family got up and were fit to help.Felixrsquos antidote to hard work was finding time to relax and enjoy himself.ldquoI loved watching horse racing, football and snooker on the TV and often attended Downpatrick races in the earlier days, he said.The secret to his long le  ldquoI was blessed with the company of a loving family, friends and neighbours and I love to see the younger generations coming to visit, he said.Felix says he always advised his family and friends to be content with what they had and not to take le too seriously.ldquoI dealt with things as they happened, thatrsquos how I dealt with le, he continued. ldquoI feel very lucky to have reached this age as a lot of my friends and family have passed before me. I always leave a weeof tea in the bottom of my cup so maybe this has helped me live so long!Felix was born in Ballykinlar just weeks before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles, which officially ended the First World War, on June , .He was the fourth child of Felix and Ellen Burns and learnt the value of hard work from his parents. His father was a butcher, while his mother ran a small sweet shop and cafe and used to bake bread for the soldiers, particularly the GIs who were stationed at Ballykinlar army barracks during the Second World War.Felix was in his early twenties during the war. His youngest daughter, Anne, says the bombing of Belfast is something that stuck with him all his le.ldquoThe Blitz in Belfast is something that Daddy always talks about. He says he can remember that he and a friend climbed up to a top of a nearby hill to watch the bomber planes. The noise and drone of the bombers flying over was something that still stays in his mind.The family had moved to Rossglass when he was  and daughter Eileen recalls how his father courted her mother, Isobel , when she was just .ldquoDaddy tells us how he had to cycle into Downpatrick to go to the pictures with Mummy so it was a very dferent time to now, she said.The couple married in  and went on to have nine sons and four daughters mdash the late Oliver, Peter, Sean, Kate, Paddy, Eileen, Dominic, Eamonn, Kevin, Malachy, Martin, Mary and Anne.He worked the -acre farm at Ballylig Road until his later years but his children say that he still enjoys giving his son, Peter, who now runs the farm, his expert advice to keep him right.Felix grew potatoes for many years and most of the people from the village picked for him at some time or other, including Killoughrsquos own Canon Sean Rogan, former parish priest of Downpatrick, who visited him on his birthday.Eileen says that while their father was strict with them, he was always very kind and fun-loving.ldquoDaddy is cheerful, happy but believes in hard work. Hersquos very resilient and now he really enjoys seeing a good day on the farm and being brought out to the porch where he can hear the birds. He has always loved farming and is very passionate about nature, she said.Mrs Burns died of cancer in  and Felix has had more than several close calls with his health since then.Eileen said: ldquoHersquos had four heart attacks, hip replacements and skin cancer, but he has been blessed with good health and we put that down to his hard work and plain eating. He wouldnrsquot have any kind of takeaway about him.For the last  years, he has received daily care from two healthcare assistants, Cindy and Amera, who the family say are devoted to their father and they are forever grateful for what they do for him.While two of his children live away from home mdash Eileen in London and Eamon in Kilkenny, Felix kept his travels to Britain and Ireland.ldquoDaddy came over to see me in London when he was  and was on the Tube for the first time in his le. He couldnrsquot believe how erse London was and the buzz about it. He loved it, added Eileen.Felix is known for his friendliness and was never one to pass a neighbour on a lane or the road without stopping for a chat.He and his two childhood friends of more than  years, Henry Starkey and Tam Montgomery, were stalwarts at the Minerstown Tavern every Saturday night mdash so much so that there is a framed painting of the three of them hanging today in the bar.Felix and his family had asked friends to give donations in lieu of gts to Cancer Fund for Childrenrsquos Daisy Lodge Centre in Newcastle..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Claragh Bridge rally raises £3%2C000 for charity  ","story":"CLARAGH Bridge Vintage Club held their annual rally in aid of Motor Neurone Disease Associationunder blue skies and fine sunshine on Friday evening.Over  tractors and  vintage classic cars and Land Rovers revved up their engines and took to the grassy catwalk, in the field behind Oasis Community Centre.The event was organised by club chairman Liam Quinn, from Drumaroad, in memory of local farmer Hugh McClean, from Ballykinlar, who died from the illness in September last year, just six years after his diagnosis.

But it is the Downpatrick area which has been most affected by the lost days.After Down councillors were given a private memorandum of the record of absenteeism and sick leave among the bin men, Downpatrick councillor George Flinn immediately launched into an attack on their conduct.He said he was appalled by the absentee figures and wanted to know whether discipline was tight enough and whether men were dismissed after after they had been warned.ldquoSomething is wrong and it will have to be put right, he said. ldquoI do not see why these men are being retainedthey are not present.

Horace soon began researching the effects of the Troubles on the RVH, and started collecting photos, videos and press clippings. The shoebox collection grew and eventually occupied two filing cabinets.He had intended to write a book on the subject, but sudden illness put an end to that intention. He subsequently made his Troubles archive available to other authors, such as the late Kate OrsquoHanlon, senior sister in RVH Casualty, Margaret Wilson and Moore Sinnerton.In June  he sustained a sudden onset of severe ME, which immediately ended his hospital career. He spent most of the next five years flat on his back in bed, with frequent migraines, insomnia, continual acute flu-like symptoms, muscle pain and weakness, weird new allergies, and a brain gone AWOL.On air on Sunday he compared ME to having a defective battery on a mobile phone. Instead of the battery operating for  hours a day, it reluctantly provides power for only two hours. And once flat, it takes a full day to recharge. Horace never thought it was a fatal condition. But it has the same ill effects as a killer disease mdash energy loss on such a scale suddenly deprives you of job, career, income, and social and family le.ME was first defined in  by a famous Ulster doctor, Sir Donald Acheson. In the  years since, the NHS has made very little progress in identying a cause, or developing a cure. So ME patients find it very dficult to access competent medical care. But they have no dficulty in encountering hostility, prejudice, and stigma.Horace received exemplary care from a small number of NHS doctors. But he experienced hostility, suspicion and a damaging lack of knowledge with some others. His eventual route to partial rehabilitation was provided, not by the NHS, but by the arts and media sectors in Belfast and Down District.Part of his initial five-year nightmare was that he couldnrsquot read much, or watch TV. By the time he got to the bottom of a page, he had forgotten what he had read at the top. Eventually he discovered thathe underlined relevant sentences in a book, he could then fix information in his memory.Triggered by the cover illustration on Jonathon Bardonrsquos first edition A History of Ulster, in  he had begun researching the  Rebellion and the associated fighting in his home town of Ballynahinch. He continued this exploration after illness hit in . By  mdash the Rebellion bicentenary mdash he had acquired a wide knowledge of th century politics, personalities, warfare and weapons.A number of NHS personnel seemed to doubt Horacersquos sanity and or integrity mdash an attitude they automatically extended to all ME patients. But other prominent iniduals, in equally august institutions, took an entirely dferent view. Horace had amassed a knowledge of the  period, and in  they all wanted to access it mdash Brian Turner from the Down Museum, Dr Desmond Bailie of the Presbyterian Historical Society, Moore Sinnerton at the BBC and Jane Leonard at the Ulster Museum.Post-ME Horace had signicant dficulty with reading and writing at any . So everyone was very patient with the small amounts and slow pace of his product. But eventually he produced a well-reviewed major article on the Battle of Ballynahinch, . And he gave a lively bicentennial lecture on Betsy Gray to a capacity audience at the Ulster Museum. A new career was launched, though on a much, much smaller scale than before the onset of illness.Horace has now developed a lecturing technique which overcomes his dficulty with the written word. His PowerPoints are really image-rich slide-shows, and he talks to what he sees in the pictures. Audiences remark that ldquohe can talk for an hour without notes, unaware that he continually faces the screen, and uses the images as visual prompts. They quite like the near-cinema experience.Recently Pamela Cooper, of the Lecale Historical Society, has further improved on his technique. She made a tran of his Five Montalto Dynasties lecture, and then turned it into a major printed article mdash his first in  years.Horace continues to have signicant ME disability, with the typical energy deficit, so for him local history is a vital form of occupational therapy. One of his reasons for going on radio was to thank all those down the decades who have given him an outlet for his hobby.These include the late Dr. Brum Henderson, of the Ballynahinch Murals Group Vincent Fullam, of Ballynahinch Regeneration Joanne Patterson, BBC, Your Place and Mine Martyn Todd, of Discover Saintfield: Dr Winston Shaw and the Presbyterian Historical Society Gordon Wilson and the late David Anderson at Montalto Estates Dr Eacuteamon Phoenix the Editors of the Mourne Observer and Down Recorder, on many occasions Dr. Terry Cross at Killaney Lodge Karen Patterson, of the Rowallane Slieve Croob Partnership and many Probus branches and local historical societies.Arthur Davidson, Derek Rowlinson, and Peter Rowan have always kept him supplied with rare books., as did Deirdre Armstrong when the SEELB Library Board Irish Special Collection was based in Ballynahinch. Recently, published authors have consulted him about the  period, such as Conor OrsquoClery, Ken Dawson and Guy Beiner.For Horace, outdoor recreation is almost a thing of the past. But MLA Jim Wells allows him on board his birdwatching boat trips on the north coast. By this means it is possible to enjoy unique access to glorious scenery at Carrick-a-Rede, Torr Head, Fair Head and Rathlin, all without getting out of your seat, or walking a yard.Guests on Sundayrsquos BBC programme were allowed to play one piece of music: Horace picked a paraphrase from the Scottish Psalter. During the worst period of his illness he was often unable to read, but he could always enjoy music. He steadily worked his way through the HMV Classical CD catalogue. And he also reverted to the music of his childhood ndash hymns he remembered from the Ballynahinch Methodists.Dr. William Drennan, founder of the United Irishmen, once worshipped at First Presbyterian Church in Ballynahinch in . That was before the introduction of hymn-singing and church organs. Horacersquos own Scottish ancestors probably arrived around , and he imagined they would have used paraphrases in their services.This article is an amalgam of what Horace actually said on radio ndash and what he would have said given another half hour on microphone!

He was threatening to spoil the party after polling a particularly impressive  first preference votes.While not considered a threat by pundits, McMurray came just  votes short mdash after transfers mdash of causing a major shock.In the end, what was proving an uncomfortable evening and early morning for Sinn Fein sitting councillor Willie Clarke, who described the election campaign as the most intensive he had ever been involved in, and newcomer Leeanne McEvoy, ended in relieved smiles.As the duo waited for their election to be confirmed, Doran, who had been awake from .am, was nervously placing the floor, admitting to reporters he felt a ldquonervous wreck as what at times seemed a laborious election count continued.The smile on his face was unmissable when it was formally confirmed that his partners had been elected but, sadly, for the Sinn Fein duo, there was only a handful of party supporters in the election count centre to congratulate them as everyone  had gone home.Nonetheless, Doran, McEvoy and Clarke celebrated together, clearly recognising the signicance of the result for Republicans in an area once regarded as a unionist stronghold.The SDLPrsquos Laura Devlin, who was popping in and out of the count to keep an eye on her new baby Polly who is two months old, comfortably retained her seat with , votes but the election marked the end for her party colleague, Brian Quinn, who was eliminated after polling just  first preference votes.Given that he was so far behind, it was inevitable that Quinn, who was a member of the former Newry and Mourne Council, would lose his seat, although early on in the count it was not clear to whom. When the SDLP stalwart was formally eliminated from the contest he was consoled by his loyal party colleagues.As for DUP man Hanna, his canvass was hampered by the fact that  weeks ago he underwent hip replacement surgery, restricting his mobility. However, the voters came out in numbers helping him top the poll which he admitted he hadnrsquot expected.Elsewhere, there were resounding wins for the UUPrsquos Harold McKee mdash who is ing to the council chamber for a second time after losing his South Down Assembly seat in  when the number was reduced from six to five mdash and Independent Unionist Henry Reilly.The highly respected McKee is no stranger to elections and admitted that the most recent was his easiest to date. Given the absence of the Assembly he believes it is time more powers were handed to local councils to let them get on with the job of looking after their respective districts.McKee insists that local government is about delivering for people, highlighting the importance of all councillors working together for the benefit of their respective areas.Reilly, who fought his first election  years ago and along with McKee was elected on the second count, surprisingly admitted that he was worried going into this one as he did not have a party machine behind him. He described his election as ldquomost satisfying.While his vote dipped by over  from , Reilly explained that when he topped the poll five years ago as a member of UKIP, the party was spending tens of thousands of pounds on its EU election campaign and he was its Northern Ireland candidate.Afraid that his council vote could have collapsed by as much as , Reilly focused his election campaign solely on Kilkeel and Annalong which he described as his ldquoheartland also expressing concern that he was not allow to declare himself as an Independent Unionist on the ballot paper and that Alliance was running a strong candidate.As for McMurray, he insisted that he had no regrets switching to The Mournes as it ldquofelt the right thing to do and was pleased with his performance first time out in an area which was new to him.He used a football analogy to describe coming just  votes short of causing a major upset, adding: ldquoItrsquos like playing well away from home and losing -. A great game and great performance but you donrsquot get the three points. It is certainly not the end and given that there are almost , Alliance voters in The Mournes it is a bigger mandate than some people elected in other areas have.

It is a problem they need to solve with SDLP and Sinn Fein sources suggesting better engagement with these particular voters is needed.The SDLPrsquos share of the vote in the Downpatrick DEA has decreased from almost % five years ago to .% with Sinn Feinrsquos share decreasing slightly from .% in  to .%.By contrast, Independent candidate Cadogan Enright increased his vote by , comfortably passing the , mark for the first time.Pundits were suggesting that Enright could end up locked in a battle for the fth seat with the SDLPrsquos Trainor and there were audible gasps in the Newry count centre when it was officially confirmed that the Independent candidate had finished second behind Sharvin on first preference votes, immediately placing increasing pressure on those chasing the remaining three seats.Enrightrsquos increased vote, which did not come as a surprise to the man himself, is viewed as a reward for his hard work with community groups in Downpatrick and those dotted across Lecale where he is extremely active in village communities.And, just like in , many of these groups officially endorsed his candidacy and played a key role in an election canvass which saw a small army of workers trudge across the district on his behalf knocking doors and putting election material through letterboxes.Regarded as a politician who gets things done, Enright is a thorn in the side of the big two parties in Downpatrick who took time to digest his performance at last weekrsquos poll.Enright insists that analysis of the past four council elections in the Downpatrick DEA confirms that both the SDLP and Sinn Fein are losing favour with the people of Down and Lecale and that over the same period the unionist vote has remained steady at around seven percent.Aontuacutersquos Macartan Digney surprised many when he polled  votes and there are those who suggest that the well known candidate who is a member of the Downpatrick Community Collective mdash an umbrella body for local community groups and residentsrsquo associations ndash may have taken votes off Enright whose first preference performance may have been even better.As for the SDLP, the party heaved a huge sigh of relief that its three runners, including the provincersquos longest serving councillor, Dermot Curran, made it home.All the party candidates had a fight on their hands with veteran Curran openly admitting that he was worried going into the election, describing it as his toughest to date. Sinn Fein clearly had the SDLP worried.Republicans fought an intense campaign as it always do and there was obvious disappointment that only Hanlon, contesting her first election, secured a seat, with Madden unable to join her.Hanlon, who works for South Down MLA Emma Rogan, ticks an important box for Sinn Fein as she lives and works in Downpatrick and is acutely aware of the key issues which she will be able to address at council level.Not having a councillor on the ground in the county town was an issue the party wanted to address at this election, but the hope of having two candidates evaporated as the Downpatrick count progressed and Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join his party colleagues in the chamber.Alliance, which did not field a candidate in , was delighted with the performance of student Tiernan Laird who polled  votes,  ahead of the UUPrsquos Alexander Burgess, who was the partyrsquos third choice to contest one of the five seats up for grabs in Downpatrick.The DUPrsquos James Savage increased the party vote by five, polling  first preferences, while the Green Partyrsquos Jamie Kennedy polled  votes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein now biggest party  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos chairman and vice-chairman were the high profile casualties of last weekrsquos local election.Following a marathon two-day count at Newry Leisure Centre, current SDLP chairman Mark Murnin lost out to his running mate Hugh Gallagher in Slieve Croob while his Sinn Fein deputy, Oksana McMahon, lost her seat in Crotlieve in an election of shocks and surprises.Overall, Sinn Fein emerged as the biggest party with  seats mdash up two from  mdash but it was a bad election for the SDLP which lost three of its most experienced councillors, Kate Loughran , Brian Quinnand Michael Carr . The party now has  seats.Alliancersquos Patrick Brown produced a stunning performance to top the poll in Rowallane, with another shock in Slieve Croob where Ulster Unionist Alan Lewis, who was contesting his first election, topped the poll.Sinn Feinrsquos bold strategy of running three candidates in The Mournes paid off, but the election also marked the rise of the Independents with stunning performances by Cadogan Enright , Jarlath Tinnelly, Mark Gibbonsand Gavin Malone in Newry.Sinn Fein went into the election with hopes of potentially taking up to  seats given the runaway success of South Down MP Chris Hazzard in the  Westminster poll when Republicans won a % share of the vote across the constituency.The party earmarked Downpatrick as a key battleground to secure two seats and had high hopes for Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden, who were contesting their first elections. But it wasnrsquot to be with only Hanlon getting over the line as Madden struggled to secure the transfers he needed to join her.A statement of intent by Republicans to secure three seats in The Mournes for the first time paid off with Sean Doran, Willie Clarke and Leeanne McEvoy elected, with the election of latter two confirmed shortly before am on Saturday.Sinn Fein were also bidding to secure three seats in Slieve Croob, but sitting councillor John Rice lost his seat, with Roisin Howell and Cathy Mason elected. Republicans were also disappointed at the loss of Ukrainian-born McMahon in Crotlieve amid suggestions by their political rivals that they had overstretched in this area.Despite McMahonrsquos loss, Gerry OrsquoHare and Mickey Ruane were elected in this DEA, while in Slieve Gullion it was almost a clean sweep with the party taking five of the seven available seats.The SDLP were mightily relieved to retain their three seats in Downpatrick with Gareth Sharvin topping the poll and joined by his colleagues Dermot Curran and John Trainor, the latter getting over the line thanks to UUP transfersBut the loss of council chairman Murnin to his party colleague, Hugh Gallagher, in Slieve Croob was a major blow for the party.The effervescent Terry Andrews secured his seat in Rowallane, but he missed out on topping the poll this time around and Laura Devlin was unable to take her running mate Brian Quinn over the line with her in The Mournes, much to the disappointment of the party. Quinnrsquos seat was one of a number Sinn Fein had targeted and successfully wrestled from the grasp of nationalists.Declan McAteer retained his seat in Crotlieve with former South Down MLA Karen McKevitt securing a seat. Pete Byrne recorded the third highest vote in Slieve Gullion but Loughran missed out despite polling , first preference votes.Alliance retained the two seats it held in Rowallane and Slieve Croob and came agonisingly close to pulling off a major shock in The Mournes where Andy McMurray, who had switched from Slieve Croob, came  votes short of denying Sinn Fein its hat-trick success.McMurray wasnrsquot given much of a chance as the party only polled  votes in , but he pulled in almost  first preferences as the Alliance surge across the Province had ripple effect across the district.Pundits had not predicted Brown topping the poll with some even suggesting that he could have been involved in a dogfight for the fth seat after the decision by Independent Martyn Todd to enter the fray. How wrong they were with him securing , first preference votes.Gregory Bain, who was defending the party seat in Slieve Croob, was ahead of Murnin by  first preference votes and this effectively kept the council chairman behind the eight ball for the remainder of the count. Newry candidate Helena Young also polled well in her first outing securing  first preferences. The UUP were cock-a-hoop that Lewis, contesting his first election, topped the poll with a stunning performance, more than doubling Dessie Pattersonrsquos vote in  to take his seat in the chamber alongside David Taylor , the ing Harold McKee in The Mournes and Rowallane stalwart Robert Burgess.But there was disappointment that Walter Lyons did not join Lyons in Rowallane, with party officials also pointing to the lsquoTodd factorrsquo which resulted in Burgess being unable to transfer as many votes as planned to his running mate.The DUPto the council with one seat less after Maynard Hanna failed to retain the Slieve Croob seat previously held by Garth Craig. Despite the disappointment, Glyn Hanna topped the poll in The Mournes for the first time mdash just weeks after hip replacement surgery, with Billy Walker and Harry Harvey retaining their seats in Rowallane where it is a case of as you were with the same five councillors ing to the council.Independent Unionist Henry Reilly, who topped the poll in The Mournes in , was delighted to retain his seat three decades after he fought his first election, describing his success as his ldquomost satisfying as he did not have a major party behind him, as was the case five years ago when he was a UKIP candidate.Aontuacute will be relatively pleased with its first election performance with its three candidates polling over , votes.

He could not have hidden his delighthe had wanted to.His win secured the seat for the UUP in an area where the DUP was previously the dominant unionist representative.Lewis said that he treated his canvass as a job interview and his message clearly resonated with voters. He believes there is a clear disconnect between residents and local government and aims to help repair the damage in his new role as a councillor.The UUP man, who was previously a member of UKIP and the TUV, says he intends to rebuild ldquotrust and confidence and maintains that politics is about ldquomaking an impact, not an income.Ballynahinch man Garth Craig polled , votes for the DUP in , but his decision to bow out of local politics prompted the party to select the experienced Maynard Hanna from the Mourne area to contest the seat.Hanna polled  votes but could not secure the transfers he needed with party sources suggesting that evenhad lived closer to Slieve Croob, it may not have been enough given the fact that UUP man Lewis has enjoyed a high profile over recent years.Sinn Fein invested much in their three Slieve Croob candidates and were hoping to get all three elected, but the vagaries of a PR election can often throw up unexpected results.The fact three Sinn Fein candidates captured over % of the votes was a signicant achievement, but sadly not enough to help sitting councillor Rice retain his seat.Roisin Howell, who was co-opted to replace Stephen Burns, produced a storming performance securing , votes but her colleague Cathy Mason, also contesting her first local government election, went even better, securing , votes.Both were understandably nervous as the count entered its final stages, with the exclusion of Rice paving the way for the two women to secure their seats, much to the delight of the Sinn Fein contingent following what a y campaign.Party officials have high hopes for the two women who intend to focus on a number of key issues including tourism and community, in particular, much-needed facilities for families across Slieve Croob.Their election further increases the number of women in the chamber with Sinn Fein delighted at the impact this will have moving forward.As for Alliance, Bain said he will be focusing on mental health issues.

Niall Johnson used his speed to torture the St Michaelrsquos defence as he left his marker in his wake and bore down on goal in the first minute only to see his shot saved by Gavin Marsden.St Michaelrsquos were lively in the opening minutes and they opened the scoring in the fth minute with a m free from the dangerous Joe McIlduff, who was deadly from the frees throughout the game and St Paulrsquos had to limit the fouls they conceded due to his accuracy.St Paulrsquos opened their account with a left-footed free from man of the match Fintan Eastwood from m and St Michaelrsquos hit back with a handy free from Conor OrsquoNeill.Seaacuten Tucker then tagged on a trio of points to help the Holywood men pull away from their west Down opponents.St Michaelrsquos, though, struck back with their first score from Brian Morgan. Fintan Eastwood added his second score of the game after great work from Daacuteire Rooney in midfield.St Michaelrsquos came back at Holywood and some great work left Morgan free to slot the ball over the bar, but a terric block by St Paulrsquos defender Jonny Parsons prevented the score.St Paulrsquos gathered possession and transitioned the ball up to Niall Johnson, who again left his marker for dead and bore down on the St Michaelrsquos goal before passing to Seaacuten Tucker.However, he was fouled to stop him scoring a goal, but Eastwood tapped over the resulting free from m. Eastwood added his fourth point of a fantastic game for him after great work by Conleth Rooney to set him up.Tucker added a m free before the first goal of the game. Daacuteire Rooney won the resulting kick out and ran m at speed into heart of the St Michaelrsquos defence before passing the ball to Tucker.He danced past two defenders before slotting the ball past Gavin Marsden in the St Michaelrsquos net. Further points from Eastwood, Niall Johnson and a Tucker free left the score at half-time a lopsided - to -.St Michaelrsquos again came out strongly in the second half and dominated play for the first five minutes with John Kearney scoring from play and McIlduff adding another free.St Paulrsquos finally came out for the second half when Daacuteire Rooney ran at the St Michaelrsquos defence before slotting over a terric point from m. Not to be outdone, the industrious Ben Gray took himself on a similar run and had the same result as he slotted over a point.St Paulrsquos were forced into an early substitution in the second half with Daniel Eastwood, ing from Australia, replacing Rooney, who pulled up with a hamstring injury.Danielrsquos brother, Fintan, added to his score collection with another point before Rooney scored the best point of the game. The Lisburn Distillery soccer star won the ball in midfield before taking off on a m lung-bursting sprint with the ball before a neat one-two with Daniel Eastwood provided him the space to slot the ball over from m, much to the delight of the St Paulrsquos supporters.Daniel Eastwood then took centre stage proving what a great asset he is going to be for St Paulrsquos going forward as he scored the next three points all from play.Last seasonrsquos player of the year Daacuteire McGrattan came off the bench for Daacuteire Rooney showing the depth St Paulrsquos now have in the  and he quickly made his mark.After a St Michaelrsquos player was rightly yellow carded for a rash sliding tackle, St Paulrsquos took the free kick quickly and a marauding McGrattan took the ball at high speed and fought off the challenges before smashing it into the top corner of the St Michaelrsquos net. McIlduff continued to punish St Paulrsquos indiscretions by scoring five frees in the second half, but St Paulrsquos were too strong and Fintan Eastwood added to his man of the match performance with his seventh point of the game.Seaacuten Tucker rounded off the scoring with the last score of the game. A convincing win for the Holywood men, but in truth there were multiple chances for goals that were not taken and in the stronger tests to come, the St Paulrsquos lads are going to have to be much more clinical in taking those goal chances.St Paulrsquos: Craig McKenna, Owen Loughran, Conor McPeake, Johnny Parsons, Ruairi Collins, Paddy Falls, Ben Gray , Daacuteire Rooney , Gerard Walls, Fintan Eastwood , Seaacuten Tucker , Martin Cox, Oliver Monaghan, Conleth Rooney, Niall Johnston .

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

If these columns hadnrsquot been removed public safety could have been compromised due to the seriousness of the corrosion damage on many of the column heads.Councillor Lis Burnett, who represents Penarth, told the outgoing leader ldquothere has been widespread concern in the town over the removal of these lamp posts and asked for a review of the ldquowisdom and cost effectiveness of replacing the lamp poststo be published. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Known for his diplomacy, patience and people skills, Edward – who is the son of company founder George Walter Wilson – steps down after  years, having played a pivotal role in making Ulster Carpets one of the province’s leading exporters and the largest single site producer of axminster and wilton carpet in the world. While he grew up around the business, Edward followed in the footsteps of his older brothers, Walter and John, and officially joined Ulster Carpets in . In the intervening years, he held many positions, including in sales and planning, before becoming Managing Director and then, eventually, Chairman. Recognised as an astute leader, he was well known for taking a daily tour of the business where he spoke to staff at every level and kept up-to-date on the latest orders and technological developments. Many of the current management team were personally mentored by Edward, including Group Managing Director  Deputy Chairman, Nick Coburn. Edward commented: “One of my greatest pleasures in le has been going into the factory and talking to our staff. As I have been reminded so many times, one of the biggest selling points of Ulster Carpets is our wonderful workforce – people who are passionate about what they do. “When my father started Ulster Carpets in , I’m sure he never thought that the company would still be here over  years later, employing people not just in Northern Ireland but across the world. For that success, I must pay tribute to our wonderful staff and that is something I take great pride in.” Despite this retirement, the Wilson family will remain at the helm of Ulster Carpets, with Edward’s nephews, Nick Coburn and John Wilson, as Group Managing Director and Chairman respectively. Paying tribute to Edward’s passion and devotion to Ulster Carpets, Nick Coburn said: “When I joined the company  years ago, it was Edward who mentored and guided me through every facet of our business. Since I became MD in , this bond and incredible support from Edward has been vital to ensuring the company has continued to prosper and develop. “As we look to the future, I would also like to highlight the outstanding work and dedication Edward has done to prepare the company - and the next generation of the Wilson family - for a secure and successful future.” John Wilson, who takes over as Chairman, added: “Edward is held in the highest esteem by the company, the industry and, of course, the whole Wilson family. Edward’s commitment to seeing the company evolve and constantly adapt to the inevitable challenges that comes with  years of business is one of the reasons why Ulster Carpets is such a great company and has been so successful. “His decision to step down from his role as Chairman is another challenge for the business but he leaves the company in a strong place.” Following his last meetings with shareholders and board members, Edward’s final act was an official event at the company’s Castleisland factory where staff had an opportunity to say a final farewell.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

Either, they will need it when we leave, or they will need itwe stay,” Mr Thompson said.The status applies primarily to physical goods being transported across customs areas, including manufacturers, agri-business and general retail.Martin Dubbey, managing director of Safeguard AEO, said: “The big concern is not just the Northern Ireland border with the Republic. You also have  HGVs coming out every day down to the port, and then across.“I think there has to be some sort of fudge .”Meanwhile, Karen Wheeler, who heads the UK Border Delivery Group, has told a group of businesses here that there is no magic technological solution for preventing a hard border in Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/gym_1.jpg","title":"new exercise business for city centre hotel","story":"Posted on Tuesday May  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest hotel will soon be punching well above its weight as a new exercise business sets up shop, Ulster Business can reveal.Fitness franchise Round has been growing in the UK at a steady pace, and will open its doors later this month at the Grand Central Hotel in Belfast city centre.Rather than running on a set schedule, a new Round session starts every three minutes, allowing a new workout every day, including a range of weight resistance, cardio and core-strength training.The company is one of the first brands in the UK to utilise wearable heart-rate technology, and class participants wear heart rate monitors, which are hooked up to a big screen in the gym.It’s understood Round Belfast will be opening in May .

Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
