The National Electoral Institute said 98,854 of them mailed ballots by Saturday, more than twice the amount of Mexicans abroad that voted in the last election. Josefina Serrano, 44, who rode eight hours to Tijuana from Sacramento on a bus organized for voters, said she voted for Lopez Obrador because she was tired of corruption and violence in Mexico, as well an anti-Mexican attitude in the United States.\u0027I came because I want things to change, and to shut up even President Trump,\u0027 she said. \u0027Living in the United States, you\u0027re called out for being Mexican - not just by Trump, but by everyone.

But he vows to reduce inequality, improve pay and welfare spending and run a tight budget.Lopez Obrador was by no means the only candidate to lambaste Trump, with all three contenders signaling their opposition to the US president.But his rivals warned that a victory by leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador could set the country back decades with an interventionist economic policy.             The leftist presidential candidate of the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casts his ballot on Sunday in Mexico City          Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador waves after voting as part of the Mexico 2018 Presidential Election on Sunday.

The series began with some pictures she took at a pool in Barcelona. Using a Rolleiflex camera she shot from below to capture the modernist jut of ing boards against the clear blue sky.Laval was drawn to her “poolscapes”, she has said, to recreate some of the languorous summer joy of her growing up her pools are all about memory. The dazzling reflected light gives her pictures not only a painterly quality, but also the shimmer of half-recollection. Some of her images are\u0026nbspall about the exhilaration of water, splash and noise others, like this one, are more meditative. The best of them, like all the brightest days of summer, seem both real and imagined.As a later strand of the same series, Laval began taking photographs of abandoned or disused private pools in the US, pictures that seemed all about loss or mortality. You could perhaps convince yourself that you could feel that coda coming as you look at this picture. As David Hockney emphasised with his Californian pool scenes, there is always a dramatic narrative poolside, the before and after of taking the plunge. Given the dancing possibility of light implied in Laval’s picture, however, the figures on these ing boards resist that sudden change of state they are curiously static, each apparently in an inidual reverie. At some point, you imagine, they will have to drop into the water below, but for now they are stretching out the moment, not yet ready to submit to gravity.Poolscapes by Karine Laval is published later this month (Steidl, £35) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88c9af9e102093ba4ef832f10d921f7babd81137/162_0_6028_3617/master/6028.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ee2aea5b32e548bfd59fb25405eb3c7","title":"blowing hot air glass artists in dorset in pictures","story":"Amanda Notarianni and Charlie McPherson, glass artists at Notarianni Glass in Poundbury in Dorset "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb1a7c54aea592c736f810ad0f0dd8000ccafb4e/0_227_7026_4216/master/7026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f5152b6b62997e9768bc5ec9b435981","title":"emtithal mahmoud emi interview slam poet activist sudan","story":"She has debated with presidents, been comforted by the Dalai Lama, and been called one of the world’s most inspiring women – but it’s as a poet that Emtithal Mahmoud truly shinesEmtithal Mahmoud was brimming with rage and misery when she sat down to write her poem Mama. Her grandmother had just died in Sudan, her mother was on a plane to the funeral and she felt consumed by anger.“I wrote it in one of the darkest times of my life,” she says. “It felt like my grandmother had survived everything, the war, famine, and in the end it was not just cancer, it was lack of access to proper medical research. It was a very dark time. And that poem helped me get through it.”Hours after writing Mama, Mahmoud – also known as Emi, who was born in Darfur but moved to the US from Yemen as a four-year-old – performed it at the 2015 Inidual World Poetry Slam Championship in Washington DC – and won the competition. Full of fury, Mama opens as a man asks Mahmoud: “Hey yo sistah, you from the motherland? … ’cause you got a little bit of flavor in you,  I’m just admiring what your mama gave you.” It becomes a paean to Mahmoud’s mother, who “can reduce a man to tattered flesh without so much as blinking”, who “walks into a war zone and has warriors cowering at her feet”.“Don’t talk about the motherland unless you know  that being from Africa means waking up an  afterthought in this country.  Don’t talk about my flavor unless you know  that my flavor is insurrection, it is rebellion,  resistance,” Mahmoud recited, bringing the audience to their feet and receiving a perfect score.In London on a flying visit to the UK – she’s been in Birmingham speaking on Philanthropy Age’s How to Do Good tour – Mahmoud is overflowing with charisma. She has so much to talk about, from working in refugee camps in Greece (she pulls out a wallet made from a life jacket a boy on Lesbos gave her) to meetings with the Dalai Lama (“He said: ‘There’s a lot of pain in Darfur and in Sudan’ and I was like, ‘There is’. He held my hand for a bit and I said, ‘I’m working on it and we’re with you.’”)But she’s getting ahead of herself. She turned 22 shortly after winning the slam, at which point her life started to become a little surreal. Still a student at Yale, where she was studying molecular, cellular and developmental biology and anthropology, Mahmoud was chosen as one of the BBC’s 100 most inspirational women in 2015, and wrote the poem The Things She Told Me to mark the honour. In the middle of her exams, she was invited by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences to speak at a nuclear ethics conference. “It was terrifying,” she says. “I thought, ‘They’re going to use me. I’m going to be a token.’” One of her professors told her: “Everyone is going to come with their own agenda but you stay true to what it is you want to get out there.”Mahmoud went she listened she spoke for an hour, interspersing her poetry into her talk, putting a human face on the refugee crisis and on the atrocities of Darfur. She’s since taken part in round-table discussions at the White House, including with Barack Obama, she’s opened for Ban Ki-Moon at UN events, and spoke in New Delhi to launch the 100 Million child advocacy campaign alongside Nobel peace prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. She’s nearly always the youngest person in a room.She’s recently published her debut poetry collection, Sister’s Entrance. It moves from the personal – love poems, the experience of growing up a black Muslim in the US – to the political. Head Over Heels stems from a question she was asked at her first UN general assembly meeting: “The one-millionth refugee just left South Sudan can you comment?”“Our once country—  all west, and south, and east, and north—  so restless, the Nile couldn’t hold us together  and you ask me to summarise?” she writes. Her performance is blistering. “I wrote it afterwards, I was furious.”Her poetry, she says, expresses the real emotions behind the headlines. “It’s hard, in our world, when you see violence everywhere – you’re desensitised to it,” she says. “What I try to do is to change the approach, so it helps people feel like it’s OK to feel again and to recognise that it is scary and it does hurt, and , it’s OK to cry. And people do cry.”Since she’s graduated, she’s returned frequently to Sudan, setting up “poetry town halls” for locals to share thoughts in a safe space. Earlier this year, she walked from Darfur to Khartoum in 30 days to raise awareness for peace, in what she dubbed the One Girl Walk. Thousands joined her en route sometimes, they marched through tanks. She was scared. She performed her poetry.“My parents got death threats every single day when I was walking. We were ... constantly under surveillance,” she says. “Their narrative was: ‘The Sudanese government has been conducting a weapons recollection programme and putting more security out there into the country, and security equals peace. Because there is security, there is peace, and this girl is walking because she wants to prove Sudan is safe.’ My narrative was: ‘If we can walk together we can work together, we can create and inspire a collective responsibility for peace. We’ll bring the peace together.’”Mahmoud will return to Sudan in July, where she has big plans for more community groups and workshops around the country. Mostly she is volunteering, saving the money she makes from events “run by magazines or businesses that pay very well … to do the kind of work you can’t get funding for.”Mahmoud writes to explore her feelings she performs, she says, because she has somehow found herself this platform. “A lot of things are said about people like me - young people, black people, Muslim people, women,” she says. “The reason I perform is to answer those things, to be a voice I didn’t really have growing up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcaaefe7f6ca98a7ea498a47f38d32252f1e310e/0_300_4095_2458/master/4095.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a216ed685e0ed7b6a9d02ff8ce7d9656","title":"tesco carrefour strategic alliance french retailer prices","story":"Link-up with French retailer could lead to more choice and lower prices for customersTesco and France’s Carrefour are teaming up to buy products over the next three years, a move the supermarket groups claim will lead to greater choice and lower prices for customers.The three-year strategic alliance between Britain’s biggest grocer and Europe’s largest retailer will cover the relationship with global suppliers and the joint purchasing of own-brand goods. Tesco and Carrefour say they aim to improve the quality and choice of products in their supermarkets and sell them at even lower prices. Each company will continue to work with their suppliers at a local and national level.The move could lead to more camembert, wine and other French products being sold in Tesco stores, and more British products in Carrefour supermarkets, though details have yet to be finalised, according to a Tesco spokeswoman.Both retailers are under pressure, as Amazon has moved into traditional grocery retailing with the acquisition of Whole Foods. It introduced its online food delivery service, Fresh, in the UK last year after signing a wholesale deal with the British supermarket Morrisons. Amazon also opened its first checkout-free grocery store, known as Amazon Go, in Seattle, Washington, in January.Under the alliance, to be formally agreed within the next two months, Tesco and Carrefour could also reduce their costs by clubbing together to buy petrol for delivery vans, as well as services such as legal services and accounting.The Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis, said: “By working together and making the most of our collective product expertise and sourcing capability, we will be able to serve our customers even better, further improving choice, quality and value.”The Tesco spokeswoman said a “clean team” would be established between the two companies, to ensure they did not see each other’s pricing or other commercially sensitive information.It is the first such cross-border purchasing partnership involving a major UK retailer. The deal comes just days after France’s Auchan Retail, Casino Group and Schiever Group teamed up with Germany’s , internationally and in France.Neil Wilson, the chief market analyst at Markets, said: “An entente cordiale between the two giants of British and French retailing is yet another sign that squeezing the cost base is the biggest priority for supermarkets as they seek to contain the discounters and protect margins. “On both sides of the Channel, rising costs are putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile every retailer is looking over their shoulder at Amazon and the potential disruption is could still cause in the grocery sector.”In January, Carrefour announced plans to cut costs and jobs, beef up investment in e-commerce and seek a partnership in China."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caaa6e07eacc2c20d0b43614b09f05adbd412db4/0_68_4961_2976/master/4961.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=827a94400dca8d5fe7e93429ea153b61","title":"world cup female commentators alex scott eni aluko","story":"The football might have been brilliantly modern, fluid and exciting – but the conversation surrounding the television coverage of the World Cup has been stuck in the past. That both the BBC and ITV have chosen to have highly experienced ex-England internationals on their panels is par for the course. Yet the fact that two of them – the supremely talented Alex Scott and Eni Aluko – are women appears to have got people up in arms. Perhaps it’s because they are showing up the men with the level of detailed research they have obviously put in?I can’t quite believe we are still having this sort of discussion – it should be a complete non-topic. Jacqui Oatley has been a pioneer for female commentators and presenters for a number of years. I know her well, and remember the fierce backlash she received when she became the first female voice on Match of the Day. I recall thinking :“What’s the problem? Is she good at her job? Yes. Does she know what she is talking about? Absolutely. So what’s the big deal?”Yet the topic is now back on the agenda because two of my good friends and former teammates have been such a breath of fresh air. Eni and Alex have both been fantastic during this tournament. Not because they are my friends, not because they are female but because they are very good at what they do. The whole debate reminds me of when teams are looking for a new manager and people ask me who do I think it should be, a man or woman? My answer is simple: the best person for the job.Eni and Alex are informative, charismatic and know what they are talking about. I’ve seen how much they both prepare. They take their jobs seriously and that’s obvious to see. What more do you need? The minority of people that have had a problem with them – especially some journalists – are just envious that they haven’t been offered a prime spot for this World Cup. Some people just can’t take it when someone is getting something they are not. Social media can be amazing, but it also allows people to have a platform they wouldn’t usually have – and some absolutely ridiculous things have been said. Being on Twitter is like giving strangers your telephone number – you see it all, the good, the bad and the ugly. It would be nice if certain media outlets didn’t amplify that, and stopped giving these people a platform. What do we learn from an interview on national television with a person saying they don’t like the sound of a women’s voice on TV during football, and that it hurts their ears?Being a female in a predominantly male sport, I have had my fair share of criticism, but funnily enough it’s never about my footballing ability – it’s usually something else – whether it’s gender, race or sexuality. It’s not about people having to tread on eggshells or the “politically correct brigade” having a go. It’s my real life and it happens every day.I want every woman out there, whether at the World Cup or working in a supermarket, to know: “You are not alone, not all men are sexist, it’s just the ones that are threatened by you.” Let’s hope we can stop having these stupid conversations comparing men and women. Let’s hope that jobs always go to the best person for the job, whatever their gender. And let’s enjoy Eni and Alex, performing at the top of their game – because you can be sure there are people waiting for them to fail.

Matthew Oates, a National Trust volunteer and one of the UK’s leading butterfly experts, said: “The butterfly seems to be having a very good year, with over 200 seen during the count. “Ideal weather conditions a cold and harsh winter, which has helped knock back the bracken and then a warm and sunny May and June have been ideal for caterpillar development.“As we are having some fairly dry weather, it’s now the perfect time for seeing this large and powerful butterfly.” Conservationists believe changes to woodland management, such as the abandonment of coppicing, have contributed to the steep decline of the large, fast-flying butterfly over the past 50 years.The National Trust has been given £100,000 by the People’s Postcode Lottery to improve 60 hectares (150 acres) of lowland heath and wood pasture at Heddon Valley in north Devon as a habitat for the butterfly. Other butterflies including the heath fritillary, as well as birds such as the nightjar and Dartford warbler, are also expected to benefit. To make Heddon Valley more butterfly friendly, pathways have been cut through the bracken using a remote-controlled flailing machine to allow them to move through the landscape. The high brown fritillary (argynnis adippe) is usually seen flying over bracken and low vegetation in woodland clearings or resting on flowers such as thistle and bramble. The butterfly has orange and black wings and distinctive ringed “pearls” on the underside of its hindwings.It was once widespread in England and Wales but since the 1950s has suffered a dramatic decline and is only found at about 50 sites. In addition to Exmoor, other sites include Dartmoor in Devon and outcrops of limestone at Morecambe Bay.High brown fritillaries overwinter as eggs, which are laid singly on leaf litter on dog violets or among moss growing on limestone outcrops.The larvae hatch in early spring and spend long periods basking on dead bracken or in short, sparse vegetation.The temperatures in these microhabitats can be 15-20C higher than in surrounding grassy vegetation, allowing the larvae to develop quickly even in cool spring weather. The larvae have feathered brown spines, giving them the appearance of dead bracken fronds.A charity warned last week that Britain’s biggest butterfly, the swallowtail, could become extinct within four decades because of rising sea levels. The Swallowtail and Birdwing Butterfly Trust called for new inland habitat to be created for the swallowtail because much of its home, the Norfolk Broads, are predicted to turn into salt marshes later this century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1824e5e443cb14a19b5a5a854f645e3db2f69e6/0_32_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8f94eb2403ebda114ccf45b1f764be39","title":"oxford and cambridge could become the uks first true cycling cities","story":"Both cities are seeking ways to transport expanding populations without impacting their historic centres, yet the simplest solution is staring them in the faceSometimes politics really does overlook the obvious, and there’s a fine example just now in those two great centres of clear thinking and clogged traffic, Oxford and Cambridge. Here is the problem. The country wants, and badly needs, to build on these cities’ success in tech, bioscience and other industries: 129,000 new jobs and 135,000 new homes are planned in and around them over the next decade or so. But first you have to plan how to transport all the new people, and none of the usual answers works.Even if new roadbuilding were an answer in any city, it can’t be in these two. Their historic centres are inviolable, their electorates implacable. Gone, thank God, are the days when plans could be drawn up for a new highway through Christ Church Meadow. More buses? Both cities’ centres are already choked with them. s? Vastly expensive and disruptive, years to build, and couldn’t hope to serve most of the journeys people will need to make. Yet even as Oxford and Cambridge draw up plans for light rail, busways and rapid transit networks, one far simpler, cheaper and quicker answer is staring them in the face. It is something which already epitomises both places which, in Cambridge, already has a greater share of journeys than any other mode, and in Oxford not much less. It is, of course, the bicycle. In a report published today for the National Infrastructure Commission, I show how cycling can become the real rapid transit network in these cities, and how – with their small distances, historic centres and ever more dispersed employment sites – they are almost perfectly suited to it.With numbers like these, you might ask: can we really do more? Categorically yes – because those volumes have been achieved with, at least in Oxford’s case, almost no help from the authorities. One key central Oxford street is closed to bikes – while being open to buses. Oxfordshire council, the highway authority, does not have a single officer dedicated to cycling. Cambridge is better, but has relied largely on off-road or side-street routes, which are now reaching their limits. In both places, the main roads look little or no different to those of cities where nobody cycles. Designed almost entirely for cars, the streets of Oxford and Cambridge simply do not reflect how they are actually used. And in both places, most journeys from just outside the cities, though eminently cyclable, are still made by car, because the cycling alternatives are so awful. The problem is partly money. I recommend £200m for the necessary improvements. It’s a lot by cycling standards, but not by any other standards the government is already spending up to five times more on just one local road project near Cambridge.Mostly, however, it is about political will. Oxfordshire’s leader, Ian Hudspeth, impressed me as someone who genuinely wanted to do more – but the test will come in actions taken. Both cities need someone in the sort of role I held in London, and that Chris Boardman is doing in Manchester, to push things through.Cambridge’s plans, I think, focus too much on buses, which lack the flexibility of cycling, and on the metro – cited by some as a magic alternative to politically difficult subjects like congestion charging or roadspace reduction for motors, but in fact a chimera: not realistic or deliverable for somewhere of its relatively small size. Too often, politicians are seduced into single big, glamour projects, when lots of boring, smaller ones would help far more people at far less expense.Unlike building a metro under King’s College chapel, my recommendations are pretty simple, the mixture that has worked in London: segregated lanes on the main roads, better crossings of the ring-roads, congestion charging or some other kind of traffic reduction measures to make the roads safer where there is no room for separated lanes.It will be interesting to see whether anything happens. One Cambridge business leader said his city had too many members of what he called the “Triple-A club: against absolutely anything.” But even without the 135,000 new homes, the status quo is untenable – and cycling is the least disruptive way to create the capacity these cities need.Everything I recommend has already happened, years ago, in other countries. Given the head start which cycling has in Oxford and Cambridge, they are the perfect places to show how Britain, too, can make this kind of future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fb7cc6b48e26d82fd2c09d02ec9b43f1bddccd39/0_106_2559_1535/master/2559.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa67030e4b65aa8b407658966f318a66","title":"croatia luka modric christian eriksen denmark world cup","story":"Real playmaker’s class is evident, though not everything went perfectly when he faced his Danish successor at TottenhamLeafy Nizhny Novgorod, at the confluence of the Oka and Volga rivers, has witnessed geniuses in action before. Maxim Gorky, a five-time Nobel literature prize nominee, was born in the city and spent patches of his life here. Nizhny Novgorod was even named after the writer – considered among Russia’s best – for much of the Soviet era. An imposing statue of Gorky continues to tower over the main square.On Sunday evening two more maestros took centre stage. Croatia’s match with Denmark was billed as the battle between Luka Modric and Christian Eriksen, No 10 against No 10, a former Tottenham bloke against the man who filled his shoes at White Hart Lane. Only one midfield genius could end the night with arms aloft.To chants of “Ross-i-ya” – locals still dazed by their side’s victory over Spain earlier – Modric darted round the pitch in a fluid Croatia formation. One minute the slight midfielder was on the right-hand flank, making mazy runs into the corner. The next he was in the centre of the cavernous, Colosseum-like arena, hitting long passes with pinpoint accuracy. At times he even found himself level with his central defenders. But wherever he went the man with a ragged mop of hair and fluorescent green armband made things happen. Even the mis-hit passes seemed to create opportunity.Eriksen had a less productive opening half. His skill was obvious whenever he had the ball but opportunities were few and far between – Denmark labouring as Croatia dominated possession. Flitting between a second striker role and the midfield’s fulcrum, Eriksen looked to be the only Dane capable of penetrating a defence that conceded only once in the group stage.It was a testament to Modric’s class that even after he began to tire – victim, perhaps, of a knock – he continued to make Croatia click. Nonchalant, often walking rather than running, he was nonetheless an influential figure from the centre circle. As Croatia searched for an elusive winner, more often than not the route was via Modric – switching fluidly with Ivan Rakitic.Both midfield maestros come from a lineage of superb playmakers. Zvonimir Boban and Robert Prosinecki for Croatia, Michael and Brian Laudrup for Denmark. The former enlivened their side to third at the 1998 World Cup, the latter were part of their country’s golden era in the late 1980s and early 90s. For moments in the second half neither Modric nor Eriksen looked to be in such illustrious company – the game meandering as momentum ebbed and flowed. That is the thing about brilliance. Sometimes it takes only a millisecond and sometimes it does not come at all.It almost came in the 103rd minute, when a perfectly weighted floating pass from Modric found the substitute Andrej Kramaric. It finally looked to have arrived five minutes before the shootout, when Modric – in full flight crossing the halfway line – delivered what seemed to be a winning assist into the box. But the man, the midfielder, the maestro was unable to convert the subsequent penalty, after Mathias Jørgensen brought down Ante Rebic.Even the arrival of penalty kicks would not diminish the influence of these two midfielders, whose contributions would be determinative and have opposite effects. Eriksen set the tone for a calamitous Danish shootout, hitting the first one at the goalkeeper Danijel Subasic. Modric redeemed himself, calmly taking a crucial penalty before two more Danish misses and a Rakitic hit confirmed the result, 3-2 to Croatia.The Croatia captain was essential all evening but there is room for improvement. More often than not he played in a deep-lying role, as he commonly does for Real Madrid. But Modric’s attacking prowess – felt with full force against Argentina and Nigeria during the group stage – was not as evident on this occasion.Maxim Gorky never won a Nobel prize, despite his brilliance. Modric has already won the Champions League four times with Real Madrid. If he is going to guide his country to their first major trophy, the time is surely now. He, Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic are all in their early 30s and are unlikely to be reunited in Qatar four years hence.Croatia next play Russia in Sochi on Saturday. The host country and then a semi-final with Sweden, Switzerland, Colombia or England are all that stand between them and the World Cup final at the Luzhniki Stadium – a fitting theatre for one of the best playwrights of the modern game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fea99c03823c17d6d1eba5c238ac086f682b35ef/83_0_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d96b9a5be14f1eb5a581bd0e7ff20e4","title":"gareth southgate england colombia world cup","story":"Booed by their own fans a year ago, England will face Colombia with public warmth rekindled – and a plan for penaltiesIt was Sunday afternoon, in a beachfront hotel in Repino, and Gareth Southgate was thinking back to the night England qualified for the World Cup and one of those jarring occasions at Wembley – of which there have been a few – that somehow still feel so relevant when charting the trajectory of his team.Southgate was reminiscing about a scratchy 1-0 win against Slovenia last October when the overriding memory was not Harry Kane’s late winner but the sour indifference of the crowd and the jarring sight of thousands of fans feeling it necessary to make their own entertainment – origami in this case. The paper planes that landed on the pitch felt like a symbol of the fans’ apathy. Jeers soon followed. “Bored spectators, paper planes and early exits – something is seriously wrong with this England team,” was one headline. And it was even worse, as Southgate could also remember, during England’s excursion to Malta the previous month when the opponents featured a centre-half from Ebbsfleet United and, for many of the travelling supporters, something snapped.The mass walkout around the 70-minute mark that night seemed like a choreographed protest. The chants of “We’re fucking shit” told their own story and what has never been reported until now is that England’s players were also targeted as they left the ground. Malta were 190th out of 211 teams in Fifa’s rankings and had won only five competitive matches in 55 years. Yet it was 0-0 at half-time and a late goal rush, when England scored three times, did not spare Southgate and his players on the journey away from the stadium. The chants informed them they were not fit to wear the shirt. It was spiteful, mutinous and the culmination, undoubtedly, of too many years of pent-up frustration.Ten months on the current side will be in Moscow on Tuesday to take on Colombia for a place in the quarter-finals of the World Cup and Southgate – the man who applied for several Championship jobs without even getting an interview only a few years ago – has held himself in such a way he is doubling up, apparently, as an unexpected leader of fashion, asked in one BBC interview whether he was aware how much waistcoat sales had rocketed back in England.“They’ve been able to change perceptions of how an England team might play,” Southgate said of his players. “We mustn’t lose sight of that. When we qualified, people were throwing paper aeroplanes on to the pitch at Wembley. We were driving back to our hotel in Malta with obscene chants being thrown at us from supporters.“I feel like we’ve started to connect the team with the public again. I feel like we’ve created excitement, that we’ve played in a style that has really shown what young English players are capable of, and I want us to continue doing that. I really believe in the group of players we’ve got. They are young. They are inexperienced. For some of them, this will be one of the biggest games they’ll have been involved in. But maybe not the biggest. We’ve always got to keep that context for the players.”His belief is that England cannot “consider ourselves a top team until we have beaten a top team” but he is encouraging them to think like one before they get the chance to stake that claim against players such as Radamel Falcao, Juan Cuadrado and, injury permitting, James Rodríguez. Ever since the start of this tournament one phrase has been heard more than any other within the England camp. It is to “attack the tournament”. Don’t hold back, don’t play with the restraint of other England teams. Don’t be the team of Euro 2016 and many others.Southgate played in an era for England when the team spirit was undermined by club cliques. Yet on Saturday, when given a day off, Jordan Henderson, Danny Welbeck, Marcus Rashford, Trent Alexander-Arnold and Jesse Lingard went together to the Divo Ostrov amusement park in St Petersburg. Or to put it another way, two players from Liverpool, two from Manchester United and one from Arsenal, all acting daft on a rollercoaster because they thought it was going to pull away before they had fixed their seatbelts. “You have to put club rivalries to one side,” Lingard said. “We have been like family. We all get along with each other and that’s why we have done so well. There is no squabbling. There are no cliques.”Back in training on Sunday Southgate was working on his 3-3-2-2 formation and, as is now the norm, his players finished with a mock penalty shootout that involved walking from the centre circle, one by one, to take aim from 12 yards. One potential problem is that Jamie Vardy and Rashford, two players who would happily take one, may not start the match. Jordan Pickford has saved three out of 25 penalties in senior football while Jack Butland has kept out four of the 25 he has faced (but none of the last 10) and Nick Pope, England’s third-choice goalkeeper, has the best statistics, with three saves out of 13.Pope is almost three inches taller than Pickford and it will be intriguing to find out whether Southgate would give any thought to bringing on the Burnley goalkeeper in those circumstances, providing England still had a substitute available. Southgate was unimpressed by Thibaut Courtois’ unflattering analysis of Pickford’s lack of inches after England’s 1-0 defeat by Belgium last week but it is true that a goalkeeper of considerable height and arm- can have a psychological advantage over opponents in a shootout.It is a tactic Martin O’Neill employed, for instance, in the 1996 play-off final for Leicester City against Crystal Palace. It was not needed, in the end, because of Steve Claridge’s last-minute winner, but O’Neill had taken off Kevin Poole shortly before to replace him with Leicester’s back-up goalkeeper, Zeljko Kalac, a 6ft 7in Australian who was known as “Spider” because of his long reach.“Six foot seven and useless,” as O’Neill described him. There is no inside information that Southgate is planning to do the same but, for all Pickford’s talents, Courtois’ comments have probably stung because they carry an element of truth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddab8e3e1ba5a0afe7bf30596ce0f0a505802e8e/304_0_2857_1714/master/2857.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5860b6dea1700402e43a47dfb1b51f86","title":"mohamed salah signs new liverpool contract jurgen klopp","story":"Liverpool have secured Mohamed Salah on a new five-year contract that the manager, Jürgen Klopp, believes provides further evidence of the progress being made at Anfield.The Egypt international has committed his future to Liverpool until 2023 in a lucrative deal that does not contain a release clause. Salah was widely coveted following a phenomenal debut season at Anfield that brought 44 goals in 52 appearances at club level but, as expected, has followed Roberto Firmino in committing to Klopp’s team for the long term. Sadio Mané is also in line for a new and improved contract at Liverpool.Salah’s form and global status has soared since joining Liverpool on a five-year deal from Roma last summer. Negotiations on a new contract started with the 26-year-old’s agent, Ramy Abbas, before the end of a stunning debut season with Liverpool that brought a fourth placed finish in the Premier League and a Champions League final appearance. Salah was forced out of the final defeat to Real Madrid with a shoulder injury but he returned to make two appearances for Egypt at the World Cup.No financial details have been announced about the forward’s new deal but he is expected to have doubled his wage to around £200,000-a-week. The absence of a release clause ensures Liverpool are in a strong position should a rival suitor, such as Real Madrid, step up their interest in Salah in the future.Klopp, who was back at Melwood on Monday for the start of pre-season training, said: “I think this news can be seen for what it is rewarding a person who performed and contributed greatly for the team and the club last season. It demonstrates two things very clearly also – his belief in Liverpool and our belief in him. We want world-class talent to see they have a home at Anfield where they can fulfil all their professional dreams and ambitions – we are working hard together to achieve this.“When someone like Mo Salah commits and says this place is my home now, it speaks very loudly I think. Equally, our commitment to him says we see his value and want him to grow even more and get even better within our environment.“The key thing to remember is the best thing about Mo is that he never sees himself as being more important than the team or anyone else within it. He recognises his teammates and this club helped him achieve inidual success last season. He sees the inidual awards come because he is part of something bigger that is special. Mo reflects where we are as a team, I think. Last season was special with many special moments – but we want more. We want to be more successful and achieve more together – as the supporters sang so loudly: ‘We’re never gonna stop.’ This has to be the attitude inidually and collectively.”Salah will not be among the Liverpool players reporting for pre-season training on Monday. He has been given an extended break following Egypt’s World Cup campaign."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d886782a9fc76e9517308602d518c490d3a7ed41/0_27_7168_4302/master/7168.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7f6bec051d043a87568b202a54931a50","title":"watch the world cup last 10 minutes christian sinibaldi","story":"Photographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonPhotographer Christian Sinibaldi captures the joy and despair in British living rooms, as fans from Iceland to Iran, Serbia to South Korea, support their teams. Interviews by Erica Buist and Deborah LintonWhen Christian Sinibaldi turned up at homes across England to photograph fans watching the World Cup, he was overwhelmed by every nationality’s hospitality. “And their food,” he says. “I’ve eaten a lot of crisps and beer, but also the traditional Brazilian dish of feijoada in north London, Mexican quesadillas and guacamole in Putney, and a lovely Moroccan tagine cooked on the barbecue in Letchworth.”Sinibaldi sat with a fixed camera near the television screen and never asked anyone to pose: he didn’t need to. “Pretty much as soon as the match got under way, they forgot I was there.” He enjoyed watching the tension build. “Very few people left the room or changed positions throughout the game. They were glued to their chairs.”It does mean that Sinibaldi has not watched any matches himself, because he has been looking the wrong way. “But I could nearly always tell when a goal was coming – I could see it in their faces.” There’s a reason he made time for the project this year: as an Italian, it’s one way of dealing with the fact his home side didn’t make the cut.Timing is everything at Rick and Jo Cooper’s house, where the family are on countdown for England’s second match of the tournament, against Panama. With excited shouts of “Half an hour to kick-off” drifting in from the garden, the smell of burgers on the barbecue waft into the front room where the floor is strewn with balloons, inflatable clappers and St George’s flags.The country is in the early grips of a heatwave and little do the Coopers – grandmother Alison, 72, uncle Malc, 44, Rick and wife Jo, both 41, and their sons, Leo, eight, and Aaron, five – know that the sunshine will not be the only turn-up for England.Stones’ header puts England 1-0 up eight minutes in. “I missed it!” says Rick, distracted by Aaron walking in with lunch. But no one misses goals two, three, four or five – including two Harry Kane penalties – all before half-time. “This is unbelievable!” Rick shouts. “Football’s coming home.” The noise from the boys’ vuvuzelas is deafening. “The boys were too little for Brazil 2014,” says Rick, a Manchester United season ticket holder, “so I’m enjoying watching this one with them. I was obsessed with skiing as a kid. But France 98, where Beckham got sent off, that really got me into football and I’m mad for it now.”His brother Malc says, “You always have that hope with England, and it’s always been dashed. I remember Gazza with the tears at Italia 90, watching that with my late dad. And Maradona’s hand of God in 86, watching that on holiday in Torquay, around a tiny black-and-white TV. The injustice of it. But we’re perennial optimists, and with this young team, there’s a different mentality.”Their mother, Alison, is the only one who saw England triumph in 66. She says, “The country couldn’t believe it. My late husband, Henry, he loved the game. He always said: ‘If they play football, they’ll murder ’em.’ He’d have been thrilled with this one.”Kiki Machado and friends, Crouch End, London, 17 JuneCristina “Kiki” Machado’s house is a sight, and sound, to behold during the Brazil v Switzerland game, what with the yells of the 30 people squeezed into the living room, the guitar music from Kiki’s tenant Caco Barros (at front, glass in hand) and the green-and-yellow stars chalked on the pavement outside. “We drew six,” says Kiki (in hat), “because Brazil has won five times – we drew one more for luck.”Kiki’s living room is packed out with her “north London family”, friends collected over 20 years in this country, from Brazil, England, Lithuania, Serbia and Italy. When she arrived, her godmother gave her the number of her best friend’s daughter, Luciana, who was living in London. She never called, but seven years later they met by chance in the local library at a singalong for their children.“My family in Brazil said people aren’t celebrating there the way we are,” Kiki says. “It’s natural when you’re away from your country to find your people and cheer together.” She remembers as a child how everything stopped during a World Cup game, so when Martha asked if she could come home from school early for the match, she said, “Of course. Your teacher will understand.”After their 7-1 defeat by Germany in 2014, Brazilians are approaching this World Cup with trepidation. “I’m in defence mode,” says Janaína Campoy, 44 (on right, wearing glasses). “That game was a tragedy. It came just as things were going badly for us politically and economically. We lost confidence as a nation.”The self-esteem of an entire country seems a lot to put on 11 men, but they don’t let them down. After the match, they party until midnight, because that’s the Brazilian way to celebrate a draw. “When we won in 2002, that party lasted 24 hours,” Kiki says. “The hangover lasted a week.”Adama Kande and friends, Ancoats, Manchester, 24 JuneThe music and the chat don’t stop at Adama Kande’s city centre flat. Adama, 44 (in front of picture), a musician, came to the UK from south Senegal in 2008 and the green, red and yellow of his home country is all around his living room: on flags, posters and djembe drums.Watching with his partner Neilum Singh, 43 (second from right), and friends Iain Dixon (far right), 40, and Lamin Conteh, 42 (far left), Adama cannot hide his excitement. “Senegal is like Brazil,” he says. “Everyone plays football. When I was a boy, my neighbour was manager of the local team. He taught me, too – I’m a good player.”An early goal from Senegal superstar Sadio Mané sends them wild: the music and chants get louder, and the energy soars. When Japan equalise, Lamin booms: “It’s game on. Game on.” But when Japan equalise a second time, the mood deflates.“I wanted more,” Adama admits at full time. “They got the opportunity to win, but there were a few mistakes. They need to change tactics now.”For him, the World Cup couldn’t get much sweeter than 2002, when Senegal beat title holders France in the first game and reached the quarter-finals. He watched back home, crowded around a neighbour’s TV. “When Papa (Bouba Diop) pushed that ball inside, it felt as if we could beat anybody.”Neilum agrees: “They love their sport in Senegal. Because people have limited access to technology, they’re forced to share a TV, sometimes outside, sometimes in a cinema. Watching football with West Africans is electric – it’s just fire.”Before most Morocco matches, Mohammed Essakhi, 54 (in cap), finds himself in the kitchen cooking nibbles for friends coming over. He’s a school head chef and caterer, focusing on Moroccan and Spanish food. For this game, his starters include hummus, tzatziki and stuffed peppers. The barbecue comes after, “because when there’s a football match on, we want to watch it”.Balbair Chahal, 42 (pictured front left), works with Mohammed at the school Phil Moore, 56, and Amanda Brosnan, 50 (centre), are friends and fellow Leicester City supporters. They watch the game with Mohammed’s wife, Rosalind, 56, his nephew, Kaeran Duff, 30, his son, Nizar, 16, who is training with Watford and hopes to go pro, and his daughter, Azza, 22 (far right).The 1-0 loss to Iran is “a bit of a let-down”, because the team played well, says Mohammed. Azza points to an important difference: “Footballers in England are so famous – it’s good to see people from your own background compete on the same platform.”“I would love Morocco to win,” Mohammed says, “but realistically, it’s not going to happen. What would really make me proud is seeing Morocco host the World Cup. We’ve been asking for about 20 years.” His best football memory is the 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986: “I was still living in Casablanca, and I remember youngsters celebrating in the street. Nobody thought it would be possible. At that time, Africa had only two teams that had qualified.”Naohiko Nishi (on right) and his eight-year-old son Atsuhiko (next to him) have no special food or drink, hang no flags, have no good-luck rituals. What they do have is a Japanese guidebook to the World Cup, with detailed information about every player: how old they are, what kind of a player. This is consulted very regularly.Today the Nishis – Naohiko and his wife Akiko (far right), their sons Atsuhiko, eight, and Takahiko, six (front right) – are watching the game with their friends Hiro and Shiho (on left), and their children Masa, 12 (on floor), and Iroha, nine (with giraffe). The children are keen footballers: Masa, Atsuhiko and Takahiko all play at the nearby Football Samurai Academy. Atsuhiko plays football three days a week, and says he hopes to play for Japan when he’s older. For him, the best moment of this game is Shinji Kagawa’s penalty, secured in the game’s sixth minute after a handball from Carlos Sánchez: “It was kind of scary before he took it – we were very surprised that we won.”His father agrees: manager Akira Nishino was appointed just two months before the World Cup began. “To be honest, Colombia is much better than Japan. They got a red card, which was so lucky for us. Winning this match was a great moment - because in the 2014 World Cup, Japan didn’t get a good result.” Though they were the first team to qualify, Japan failed to make it out of the group stages.For Naohiko, the joy of this competition has been watching Japan improve their standing on the world stage. “Japan didn’t join the World Cup until 1998. Only some of them played in Europe at the time - whereas now almost all the Japanese players play for Europe. The quality has got much better and their confidence has increased.”The win against Colombia, and a subsequent draw against Senegal, will be hard to beat, though Naohiko still holds dear his memories of the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan: he was able to attend the opening game - where he watched Japan draw against a “very strong” Belgium.Shirin Azari and friends, Bromley, 20 JuneIf only Vahid Amiri, the Iranian striker, could hear the chant from the mothers, teachers and former students of Iyda, or the Intercultural Youth Development Association, a Farsi-speaking community in south London: “Vahid pa Talayii omide team e mayii (Goldenfoot Vahid, you are our team’s hope).” Sadly, his golden foot doesn’t save the day: Iran’s only goal in the game against Spain is offside and they lose 1-0.It is a women-only party, organised by Shirin Azari (behind sofa, in white Iran T-shirt) with friends in Bromley. “We often get together for food and gossip and chat,” says her friend Pupak Navabpour, whose children learn Farsi at Iyda. Food is the focus at these events, and it is all set up before people arrived, “so you can eat with your eyes first”.Shirin has made dolmas and Turkish burek, and serves them with rosebud and cardamom black tea brewed in a samovar, followed by gaz (almond nougat) and nabat (crystal sugar) on sticks. “That is what we do when ladies get together,” she says. “The group was singing Iran Iran by Arash, dancing and chanting in Farsi.”“I think Iran are really good at defence, one of the best,” says Shirin, “but not attack. Even if they try to score, there’s nobody there they keep themselves to their own goal.” Despite her criticisms, she is proud of her team, “because they don’t have the facilities or coaches that western countries have.”Pupak agrees: “It was gutting that the goal was disallowed. They defended well and almost scored a few times – even though they lost, I think they did quite well.”Pupak started taking Farsi classes as an adult when she realised she was beginning to struggle with her mother tongue. Now her children go every Saturday. “My youngest said, ‘But Mummy, I’m English.’ Even though I’ve spent most of my life here, I don’t feel that kind of belonging. When I watch Iran play in the World Cup, I suddenly feel that connection to home.”On 17 June, Serbia won their first World Cup game in eight years. The more superstitious might have the Bogdanovics to thank for it: “We sit in the order we were sitting in 2010, when Serbia won against Germany,” says Deanna, 47 (on left). “We try to recreate exactly what happened that day, so we can win in the future.” Serbian snacks must be on the table and everyone must dress for the occasion.Deanna and Brian, 47, moved to London 20 years ago soon they will have spent more of their lives here than in Serbia. “Often you question where home really is,” Deanna says, “but the World Cup erases that feeling. I’m not usually into football, but the World Cup turns me into a completely different person. When we scored,” she says of the winning goal, “it was such an amazing feeling. I don’t think we breathed for the last 10 minutes.”The only year-round football fan in the family is 15-year-old Vuk. Serbia haven’t qualified for the World Cup for more than half his lifetime, and he remembers being a small boy watching Serbia beat Germany. “Back then, Stojkovic was my favourite goalkeeper, and he saved a penalty. That was a proud moment.” His ritual during the game is never to jinx it by being overconfident: “Even if we were 3-0 up, I’d still keep my mouth shut until the final whistle.” Silla Johannesdottir and friends, London, 22 JuneIceland’s mere presence here is historic. The smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup, its population is the same as Sunderland’s. Silla Johannesdottir (on far right), who watches the game with her family and Icelandic friends, bearing flags and face paint, says, “It’s like a fairytale – we’re a tiny, tiny country. No matter how it goes, we’re so super proud of them.”But the game is disappointing, ending in a 2-0 loss to Nigeria. “When we got the penalty, there was a tiny bit of hope,” Silla says, “but Gylfi Sigurdsson didn’t score. That was a real low point, a kick in the gut. Everyone just left, there was no celebration. It was a bit sad.”What went wrong? “They were just better than us. They can run, those boys, and the Icelandic team just couldn’t keep up with that pace.”Her husband, Dadi Sveinbjarnarson (back right), agrees that speed was the Nigerian team’s strength. “The Icelandic team played pretty well, they had two or three tries on goal, and that was more than Nigeria, as far as I could see. Iceland just got outrun.”Dadi feels particularly connected to the team because he used to work with Iceland goalkeeper Hannes Thór Halldórsson, whom he describes as “a Viking shield wall”. “I was a commercial producer and he was one of our film directors. He is a very talented commercials maker who had a side life as an athlete – then that became the more important part of his career.” Halldorsson even directed a Coca-Cola commercial for the World Cup, using the famous supporters’ “Viking clap” as a lead-in.But Silla thinks everyone in Iceland feels connected to the team, and that even other nations have been rooting for them. “People approach us and say, ‘Well done.’ Everyone is happy for us. The World Cup really brings people together.”Erik Sarmiento and friends, Manchester, 24 JuneIn Colombia, football isn’t watched with strangers in a bar – it is a party to be shared with those closest to you, in your home. So Erik Sarmiento, 27 (sitting on the floor), is bringing South American carnival to inner-city Manchester by cramming 10 friends and family into his small flat to watch Colombia play Poland. The beers are flowing and a Colombian barbecue is on the go, with sides of guacamole, black beans, chimichurri and patacones (fried plantain) served with hogao (tomato salsa).The Spanish TV commentary is streamed at high volume and everyone’s focus on the match is unwavering, despite the noise of friends talking. An expensive bottle of Amarone wine sits by the television for final whistle celebrations.Erik, a business manager who lives with his wife Laura Van Hoof, 28, a Spanish teacher, came to the UK as a university student on a scholarship to learn English in 2009.“Growing up in Colombia,” he says, “sport isn’t associated with status or money because you can play in the streets. Colombia turns into a carnival when the national team plays. When I watch here, with Colombian food, music, friends, it’s a little bit of home in the UK.”The group play on bongo drums and improvise beats with a cheese grater, metal jug and spoons throughout the game. For 90 minutes, it feels as if the room is poised to explode – and it does, when Mina scores 40minutes in. “Goooooooooooal-azo,” they scream. By the third goal, they hug and sing: “Championes, championes, olé, olé, olé!”Erik says, “Football is an international language. I play four or five times a week – it’s how I met these friends. I saw someone wearing a Colombian club’s kit and now we are all watching together.”“The last World Cup was the first time in our history that we made it to the quarter-finals James Rodríguez was top goalscorer and won the golden boot which was a big thing for us. Now our expectations are high.”Yves Ogrodzki and friends, Cheltenham, 21 JuneStudies over the years have reported that the French aren’t the easiest folks to please. Chef Yves Ogrodzki, 53 (with glass in hand), and his sous chef Jeremy Denni, 21, aren’t doing much to subvert those findings with their assessment of France’s victory over Peru. “It was a bit weak,” Yves says, “they could have done a lot better than that. I didn’t find it very exciting really.” Jeremy agrees, pointing out, “We have some of the best players in the world, so 1-0 is falling short. There were moments I was scared we wouldn’t win.”Yves and his wife Elisabeth, 53 (on right), run a French restaurant in Cheltenham, and they have invited the staff to their home to watch the game. “We want to bring to our customers a proper French atmosphere, so all our staff come from France. They are all in their 20s, it’s their first time working abroad, so we very often organise little parties like this at home.”Yves prefers rugby to football, but finds the World Cup gives foreigners an opportunity to talk about their national identity. “I remember when France won in 1998, people felt very patriotic. But living abroad, there’s a new dimension to our identity. The World Cup brings everybody together while still having that thing that says, ‘I belong to that country.’ Even someone like me who is more interested in other sports, we still get to go back to our roots. And I like the jokes. I’ve seen people joking on social media that now Italy haven’t qualified, they can look after everyone else by delivering pizzas.”There’s no special World Cup dish, just your basic French delights: a glass of pastis, sausages with mustard from Dijon, some traditional Parisian baguettes with ham and cornichons. “To bring luck,” Jeremy says, “we all sing the Marseillaise, the French national anthem, before the game starts.”At the apex of a isive Mexican general election, nothing brings the country together like beating Germany. Yves Hayaux-du-Tilly (back right) watched the game with his sister and her Irish husband, his daughters, the nanny Maggie who has lived with them for 16 years, his sons and their friends. His wife, who was working, was sad not to see their win.“It was a brilliant game,” Yves says. “Mexico generally make it to the finals, but they normally underperform. This time they played brilliantly it wasn’t a consequence of a mistake from the German defence. We could have scored one or two goals in the second half unfortunately we didn’t, but we won. We defeated the world champions.”The family members have varying levels of superstition when it comes to the World Cup. José Pablo, 19, “will probably wear the same underpants and shirt without cleaning it every game the Mexican team plays”. They have to hang the Mexican flag and the beer has to be Mexican: “And of course we have guacamole, nachos, quesadillas – as an expat, it’s a way to connect with your country.”After the victory, Yves was in Mexico and found the mood of the entire nation lifted. “I was there three weeks before the game and everybody was angry and trying to convince other people to vote for their candidate. Now, nobody really cares about the election. We feel nothing can be that wrong if we can beat Germany. It changes the mood of the entire country. It’s very, very powerful.”Yves, whose best football memory is watching Mexico play at the Azteca stadium during the 1986 World Cup, thinks people will be talking about this victory for decades to come. “I love that the World Cup gives us this opportunity every four years to try again. That’s what life is about: you always have the opportunity to prove yourself one more time.”Ten days later, Mexico got through to the final 16, despite losing 3-0 to Sweden in their final group match. “It was a bittersweet feeling,” Yves says. “I was a little bit disappointed by the lack of character, focus, concentration and discipline in the players. But the main objective is to get through to what we call in Mexico ‘the fifth game’,” ie the quarter-finals. “That has only happened twice, only at the World Cups in Mexico,” he says. Yves did ultimately enjoy watching the Sweden match in a pub, largely because of the simultaneous Germany v South Korea game, which saw reigning champions Germany crash out of the tournament. “We didn’t care about our score,” he says. “We were all watching South Korea and when they scored we all cheered and hugged the South Korean fans.”Lee Jaeyoung and friends, Bradford, 23 JuneNo one gathered in front of Lee Jaeyoung’s TV thinks South Korea have a chance against Mexico. The group of international students are on a study abroad programme at Bradford University. “I asked my friends how they thought we would do,” says Jaeyoung, 27 (back left), who studies psychology, “and they predicted a 2-0 loss, or maybe 2-1 if we were lucky.” He is more optimistic, hoping for a draw, but in the end the 2-1 defeat comes as no surprise. “I saw Mexico play Germany, and the Mexican team is really good.”Before his friends arrived, Jaeyoung bought some beer and fried a load of chicken drumsticks – an extremely popular combination the Koreans call “chi-maek”, from “chi” for chicken and “maekju”, the Korean word for beer. “Unfortunately we couldn’t find Korean beer,” Jaeyoung says, “so we had Stella and someone brought Carlsberg. It was a really good time.” They hung up the Korean flag for luck.“I don’t watch football usually, just the World Cup,” says Kim Seungyeon, 21 (back right), who studies psychology and counselling. “It’s a lot like the Olympics in that if our team wins, I feel I’ve won, too. I know they work hard, so I’m really happy to support them.” For her, the moment to beat in World Cup history came in 2002, when hosts South Korea reached the semi-finals. “It was the best moment – a miracle.”Despite today’s loss, they are extremely proud of the team’s forward, Son Heung-min. “He got a really incredible goal during extra time,” says Jaeyoung, who is a huge fan of the Tottenham player. “After the match finished, I saw on the Korean news that he was crying in the locker room. I felt like shouting, ‘Don’t cry, Son! We lost but you were the best!’”He was similarly impressed with his team four days later, when they achieved the unexpected and won 2-0 against Germany, marking the end of the latter team’s World Cup. “I didn’t expect that kind of score,” he says. “It was really impressive.” The match was a 0-0 draw until the 92nd minute, which would have still resulted in Germany being knocked out, but then South Korea’s Kim Young-gwon scored: “And I was like, ‘What the hell? This is awesome,’” Jaeyoung says. The goal was ruled offside, then reviewed on VAR, allowed, and was swiftly followed by a second goal from South Korea. Even though the win didn’t change their knockout from the World Cup, the celebrations were exuberant. “We were screaming and dancing,” Jaeyoung says . “I just wish I had put a bet on.”Anastasiia Fedorova and friends, Catford, London, 19 JuneThe balloon is for Anastasiia Fedorova’s husband, whose birthday was a few weeks before the match. He chose to work an extra hour in order to miss the game. “He was absent on principle,” she explains. “He’s British but was born in Ukraine, so he doesn’t support the Russian team. Sometimes we have small political battles. If there was a game between Russia and Ukraine, it would be a nightmare.”Anastasiia, 31 (on right), and Polina Kaplitskaia, 29, studied at the same university, St Petersburg State in Russia, and four years later bumped into each other on a plane from London to Moscow and rekindled their friendship. They both came to the UK for love Anastasiia’s husband is British, and Polina’s husband Andrey had been living in the UK for 10 years when he met Polina through a mutual friend on a trip to Saint Petersburg.Polina has brought along red, white and blue paints to decorate their faces with the Russian flag. She thinks Egypt’s own goal, clumsily scored by Ahmed Fathi in the 47th minute, prompted a surge of energy on the Russian side: “I don’t think our team was concentrating very hard - but then Egypt scored an own goal and after that Russia started playing better. They became more active and confident.”“Our first goal was the best moment for me,” Anastasiia says. “I remember thinking, we’re so close to winning the game, and if we win we’ll go through to the next stage and it will be the first time in Russian history.” She hopes the World Cup will be good for the Russian people: “I hope everyone sees the real Russia, how the people are nice and welcoming. Sometimes our government does things that aren’t nice, but the people are not the same as the government. My parents in Russia say the atmosphere is so warm.”Living abroad when your country is hosting sometimes means missing out on the party, and Anastasiia felt sad when she saw Instagram stories showing people celebrating in the streets of St Petersburg. “We won and that was a surprise for everyone,” she says. “We’ve only won two games so far – but for us it’s like we’ve won the whole thing.”• Commenting on this piece?

This quote makes it sound like Lionel Messi is the de facto manager of Barcelona as well as Argentina. All of a sudden, Messi walks straight up to me, looks me in the eye, and says: ‘So ... are we going to Barcelona or not?’ That was it, no explanation, nothing. He turned around and walked away. I didn’t even have time to think. I just said: ‘If you want to take me, I’ll go!’Sticking with Brazil v Mexico, I said on the podcast last night that I think Tite is missing a trick by not playing Roberto Firmino while Philippe Coutinho, who knows him so well from Liverpool, is in such good form. they had such a good understanding at Anfield. Gabriel Jesus is a great player but Firmino is better at holding the line I believe and helps brings shape to the team. I also reckon he would create more space for Neymar. In Brazil, there has been a touching story of Firmino’s former primary school teacher only just realised that her pupil of many years ago, who faced such hardship at home, was in the Brazil team. Here is Adriana Liete talking to Globo: I can’t wait for Brazil v Mexico! Michael Gleeson reckons Mexico might just have a chance today: “Looking at Mexico’s win over Germany, they won because the other team’s backline was pushed higher and the fullbacks had left the defence. If Brazil play Marcelo, he will look to get forward. That could give space to Vela. Mexico may only need one chance.” I think Brazil will score more than one goal so will in all likelihood need two chances or more. Mexico always offer entertainment in the last 16. Here is their recent history of six painful last-16 exits:2014: Controversially beaten 2-1 by Netherlands2010: Beaten 3-1 by Argentina (including a controversial Argentina goal)2006: Beaten 2-1 by Argentina in extra-time in an absolute belter of a game2002: Rafael Marquez sent off in 2-0 defeat by USA1998: Beaten 2-1 by Germany after being 1-0 up and then conceding two late goals1994: Beaten by Bulgaria on penalties with crazy Jorge Campos in goalI think Mexico might explode if the team gets to the quarter-finals. Croatia’s hero last night, Danijel Subasic, came mighty close to being Steve Morrowed. From David Hytner’s match report: The Croatia players threw Subasic up in the air during the celebrations and – in keeping with the tone of the evening – they dropped him. Mercifully Zlatko Dalic, the manager, reported he was not injured. Here’s a cracking Joy of Six on the subject of celebrations gone wrong. My favourite is Stuart McCall. It’s always worth re-familiarising yourself with his tin-fuelled car-dancing antics. “What are your thoughts on the non-award of a red card for the foul leading to Croatia’s penalty last night? Despite supporting Denmark, from my perspective there was no chance Jorgensen could make a clean tackle so it shouldn’t have been classed as a genuine attempt to play the ball,” writes Tove. “He certainly made sure he brought down Rebic and prevented him getting a shot away. If this is how the new rule works it opens the door for defenders to make reckless tackles to deny a clear goalscoring opportunity where they are theoretically trying to play the ball, knowing that they only risk a yellow card as punishment.” My first thought was that Jorgensen should have been immediately sent off. Then I looked at the replays and I could understand how the referee adjudged Jorgensen to have attempted to win the ball cleanly as he is very close to getting something on it. It’s the kind of decision that would look brilliant in the fourth minute of the match as fans would say the decision helped keep the match an even contest, thus making it a better spectacle, but coming at the end of extra-time it seemed a real injustice given that Rebic was a millisecond away from rolling the ball home. I think when intention comes into any decision a referee has to make it can lead to players getting crafty. Pique’s handball yesterday was a case in point. I’m sure he intended his arm to be up there to help stop the ball but by turning his back he made it look as though it was accidental. Many players may now deliberately foul others in similar situations and plead honesty in an attempt to get a yellow, as you say. The World Cup often sets trends. Let’s see if this is one.“Not practising penalties is INSANE!” roars Duncan in Tokyo, referencing Japan coach Akira Nishino’s revelation that he is not asking his players to work on spot-kicks. “A striker taking a penalty to win the game in the 89th minute is under exactly the same pressure as any player in a shootout. Would you tell him not to bother practising penalties?” Nope. I’m in agreement with you Duncan, particularly so when you look back at the last World Cup, when six of the eight last 16 matches went to extra-time and three were settled in a shootout. You can’t replicate pressure when practising penalties but surely knowing that you have practised something over and over again helps settle your nerves a little bit when that buttock-clenching moment arrives.“Re the Pod’s ridiculous assertion that no great goalkeepers wore short sleeves,” begins Yazan Badran. “Have we already forgotten he who is (still) the best goalkeeper in the world for me.”Thanks Niall, although I must say I’m still reeling from the news that you’re a fan of the Golden Goal rule. I quite like watching footballers limited by fatigue so that they look almost normal and 30 minutes of walking football is worth it if there’s a shootout at the end. “But what could be more dramatic than a sudden death winner?” says Niall, when I pull him up on this. Penalties Niall! Penalties! Time for me to pass the baton to Gregg Bakowski, who will guide you through to kick-off. Thanks for joining me, and why not sign up for the World Cup Fiver while you’re here?“There’s little that’s more infuriating than a team playing for pens and then mucking them up? I’d say there’s little that’s more pleasing,” says Charlie Maclean.Mexico have been training in Samara, and regrettably I have to report that Javier Hernández has asked his barber for a ‘Romania 98’:A few words from Stanislav Cherchesov, who is happy to take credit for Russia’s backs-to-the-wall triumph against Spain:“I spoke with every player inidually more than I had in the past and I had to explain to them why, where, what, and it has worked out as you see. I believe that my players have been victorious because they have adhered to my strategy.”Credit where it’s due – from 45 minutes in, Russia played for penalties, but they won the shootout. There’s little that’s more infuriating in football than a team playing for pens and then mucking them up. England at Euro 2012, I’m looking at you.Here’s a more positive stat from a Mexican perspective:So if Mexico beat Brazil today then the quarter final line -up would have no Brazil, Argentina, Spain, Germany, Holland and Italy. Wow.We’re one result away from this quite extraordinary possibility. To put it into historical context, at least two of these nations have made the semi-finals at every World Cup since – uh oh – 1966. That said, I’m finding it hard to back Mexico their opening win against Germany doesn’t look quite so remarkable now, and they’ve never won a knockout World Cup game outside Mexico.The latest World Cup Daily pod has today’s games covered, with input from Tom Marshall on Mexico, and ace Japanese live blogger Ben Mabley, alongside Paolo Bandini and Gregg Bakowski:Here’s more on the breaking news that Mo Salah has extended his Liverpool contract until 2023. His new deal has no release clause if you’re reading this, Florentino.And in less concrete but still exciting news for Liverpool fans, the Mill reports that Nabil Fekir’s move to Anfield may be back on:Extra time is a waste of time, and puts the teams that come through after an extra 30 at a weary disadvantage, go straight to pens I say, much more fun...Controversial, but I’m inclined to agree. I’ve always presumed the idea of extra time is to give the team with momentum more time to win the game from open play. As we saw yesterday, it doesn’t really work in practice. So why not bin it off? That said, I always liked the Golden Goal rule, so maybe I’m just weird.I feel for Subašić ....He saved 3 penalties and effectively won it for Croatia and yet everyone talks about Schmeichel..He currently holds 4th best record amongst active goalkeepers after last night faced 55 penalties and saved 20.Schmeichel has 75:22Interesting comment below the line, here. I would say Subasic has had his dues, there’s just a lot of sympathy for Schmeichel because he saved three pens himself and is still going home. Subasic strikes me as being very good on penalties, but a potential weak link the rest of the time. He’s this tournament’s Tim Krul, you might say.Thanks Mike, and hello everyone. Let’s kick off with some breaking, loosely World Cup related news – Mohamed Salah has signed a new contract at Liverpool! More as we get it, but for now here’s Salah, laughing and laughing at Sergio Ramos:Here’s the final word (it won’t be the final word) on the draw, and specifically, England’s place in it. David Fynn emails in: “England would do well to remember that the to the teams on the harder side of the draw, Southgate’s side are one of the teams that give the easier side its name.”And with that, I’ll hand over to Niall in London, who will take control for the next little while. From me though, it’s been a pleasure. Until next time. Haigin88 writes below the line: “Rio Ferdinand started to go down the ‘lottery of the penalties’ route yesterday, saying that training can’t reproduce the pressure situation before Gary Lineker, politely, shut him down quickly. The point being that training and honing technique gives a player something to fall back on when he’s in that pressurised situation.”Hard to argue with that, although the Japan coach probably would. Akira Nishino has said his players are not being asked to practise their penalty-taking as it’s impossible to recreate the pressurised situation Haigin88 talks of on the training pitch. Surely it wouldn’t harm though? Picking a spot and trying to hit it every time. Anyway, it’ll make it very interesting viewing should their game against Belgium go the distance later.As an aside, here’s a penalty-related factoid: the latest efforts for Artem Dzyuba (scored) and Luka Modric (missed) were this tournament’s 26th and 27th spot kicks (not including the two last-16 shootouts). That is a monstrous number. Here’s today’s front page, featuring some understandably delighted Russia fans after Igor Akinfeev’s shootout heroics.That decisive save from Akinfeev, to deny Iago Aspas, has prompted a fair amount of internet hyperbole (“one of the best penalty saves ever” etc) but it certainly was a canny bit of improvisation. “The trend for adopting more formal wear has been described as “reverse casualisation” – a reaction by a younger generation to their parents opting to wear casual leisurewear into their forties and fifties.”To today’s games then, and first up it’s Brazil-Mexico, and the potential for another upset. The Seleção have hardly hit top gear yet in Russia, but as Nick Ames reports, there’s a feeling in the Brazil camp things are beginning to fall into place. Quite what they get from Neymar, though, remains open to conjecture. His performances (with a ball at his feet as well as those of a more theatrical nature) have been scrutinised as is custom for any player who carries the hopes of a nation on his shoulders – and for any player capable of doing things like this:And what of Juan Fernando Quintero? “I’m not fat I just have a big arse,” he once quipped to fend off constant hounding by the South American press about his weight at one point in his career. Now, Colombia’s hopes against England rest in part on the midfielder’s shoulders, after a sterling start to the tournament that has left his coach Joseé Pekerman heralding him as a genius. That and more in this fascinating profile of the player by Carl Worswick.There has been a lot of talk about this supposed “easier” half of the draw and the ramifications for England, who are set to take full advantage and definitely go on to win the whole thing now. But has anyone asked Swiss or Swedish fans how they feel about the prospect of facing England in the quarters? Or are they readying themselves for Colombia? Or are they not saying anything at all as they are mostly sensible people who are perhaps focusing on their team’s next game, rather than getting ahead of themselves and worrying what might lie ahead. “Let us get this clear,” Mark Jenkins writes below the line. “A majority of the England fans here are not saying we will beat Colombia. This will no doubt be how they will paint it if England lose. Imagined arrogant English supporters is everyone’s favourite past time. All we are saying is, *if* we beat Colombia, statistically (in terms of world rankings etc), we have an easier path to the final.”  To note: England have won just two knockout games since their run to the semis in 1990 – against Denmark in 2002 and Ecuador in 2006. Kieran Pender is in Nizhny Novgorod. He writes in to pose a question:“Can Croatia win the World Cup? They are a step closer after beating Denmark last night in a nervy penalty shoot-out, and with Russia next up the Croatians will fancy themselves to make the semi-finals at least. The team was far from vintage on Sunday, with chance after chance created by their star-studded midfield going to waste. Captain Luka Modric played in a deep-lying role – as he often does at club level but a change from his positioning from much of the group stage. Could a move further forward be required for Modric to lead Croatia to the final?”He also wrote this on Modric and the duel with his successor at Tottenham, Christian Eriksen, after last night’s game. “If you use this, please just call me ‘Rob’,” emails Rob. “When does the official debate about shootouts begin?” No time like the present Rob.  Italy, Holland, Chile, Ghana. Remember them? Proud football nations that have been forced to watch on from afar this tournament. But what’s it really like for fans in those countries? In a word: painful. “This ‘easier half of the draw’ stuff leaves me cold,” writes Usini below the line. “If England are good enough to win the World Cup it doesn’t matter who the opponents are, and the idea is to win, not to participate in the finals. In 1982, after a poor start, Italy won by beating Argentina Brazil and Germany.” No easy games at this level, and all that.For every Spanish tear shed though, there is a Russian equivalent. Who’d have thunk it, to borrow a terrible phrase. Well, perhaps Stanislav Cherchesov, for one. The Russia coach, fresh from a pre-match phone call from Vladimir Putin, masterminded the victory over Spain with a supremely gritty defensive performance which, truth be told, resulted in a pretty dire spectacle but also the result a nation so desperately wanted. And said nation seemed happy enough afterwards.Is that the official end of tiki-taka then? Andres Iniesta is no more an international concern, his final bow in a red shirt marking the definitive breaking up of that glorious golden generation and with it goes the incisive derring-do of the all-conquering 2010-vintage. As Barney Ronay writes:“There is too much talent in this team for Spain to be traumatised for too long by a last‑16 exit. But a style and a culture that has been beautiful at times, irresistible at others, felt as if it had reached an end point here.”Jonathan Wilson, as is his way, saw it coming four years ago. You have to feel for anyone who has the misfortune of being on the wrong end of a penalty shootout defeat. “The lottery of penalties” (don’t get me started on that as a phrase) is a cruel, cruel way to go out of a tournament. Just take a look at Sergio Ramos here, for instance, and tell me you don’t share his anguish. Anyone? Anyone? Away from the World Cup, there’s has been some huge news in the US today – LeBron James has agreed to a monster deal to play for the LA Lakers! It’s a massive coup for the Lakers, but sadly LeBron still won’t be the biggest fish in LA’s goldfish bowl – as Zlatan Ibrahimović has been quick to point out. It’s almost as if the retired Sweden international has a sizeable ego. With Spain’s exit, the “easy” side of the draw appears to have just got even “easier”. They should just go ahead and etch England’s name on the trophy now. Or not. It’s a topic that the podders get to grips with today, plus there’s the usual chat about players’ hair choices, the continuation of a discussion about World Cup’s shithousery, and Kasper Schmeichel’s balls. In short, essential listening.Another day, another opportunity to sift through the detritus of big upset. As we get our heads around the unlikely fact that Russia are into the World Cup quarter-finals (the quarters!), so too we must contemplate the demise of the 2010 world champions, and the end of a golden era with Andres Iniesta now stepping away from international football.As has become the norm in the modern-day game, there were plenty tears at the Luzhniki Stadium – Spanish ones, most notably from (and Liverpool fans, pull yourselves together here) Sergio Ramos, after a gut-wrenching penalty shootout defeat, but also from Russian eyes as the host nation, written off before a ball had been kicked, upstaged their more illustrious opponents to prolong what is an improbable journey.Few will claim it was pretty – the possession pie chart resembled a Spanish Pacman whose mouth was hardly gaping – but still, it’s the final scoreline that counts, right? Russia will now meet Croatia for a place in the semi-finals (the semis!) after another decisive shootout over in Nizhny Novgorod that was not kind to Denmark. Their coach said the outcome represented “the brutality of football”. It can indeed be cruel.Plenty more reaction to those results over the course of the next few hours, along with a look at ahead to the upcoming last-16 fixtures. Who will be today’s fall guys? Brazil or Belgium? Or both? Or will a degree of order be restored with victories over the underdogs of Mexico and Japan? There doesn’t seem to be a great deal of respect for the old world order, so you’d be forgiven for thinking anything can happen.Throughout the course of the dayeveningwhatever it is where you are, please do feel free to get in touch on email (mike.hytner@the) or Twitter (@mike_hytner) or below the line.

But some pioneering approaches are offering new solutionsOne sunflower painting looks like another here, each numberless door is identical and I am hopelessly disoriented desperate to find an exit, a shaft of light, even. I turn right, up another featureless corridor, and then left and then right again – but is this really the way I came?Her difficulties happen closer to home, too, compounded by memory loss: “When I moved to my new house, I hadn’t appreciated how difficult it would be to learn where I lived. The main issue was the four houses looking the same, nothing to differentiate one from another except a number and, of course, I couldn’t remember my number. So I put two forget-me-not tiles, one on each side of my door, to tell me that was my house. And inside the house, I removed two doors as I couldn’t remember where they led.”Of all forms of dementia, Alzheimer’s especially is associated with a severe decline in navigational skills. “There’s an overlap between the brain regions affected in the early stages of Alzheimer’s and the areas important for spatial navigation, including the entorhinal cortex of the temporal lobe,” says Wiener. These difficulties could emerge decades before Alzheimer’s is diagnosed. In another virtual reality experiment, German and Dutch researchers detected impaired navigation (as measured by the function of grid cells in this location) in young adults who were at genetic risk of developing the condition, but potentially wouldn’t until many years later.For 15 years, Wiener has been building on psychology and neuroscientific wayfinding research to redesign environments. Virtual reality is ideal for this work, he says. It is impractical to build a care or residential setting, measure how people with dementia fare and then redesign it a few months later. “But VR enables us to simulate unfamiliar home environments and then simply change features and structures systematically, whether it’s the layout of corridors, the number of intersections or the types of landmark.”Virtual reality next transports me from Bournemouth to Virtual Tübingen, the university town near Stuttgart, in Germany, where Wiener did his PhD. After that, it is on to a virtual care home where PhD student Chris Hilton has run his most recent experiments with people without dementia. Here, older participants are slower at learning routes than young adults: they make more errors and need more repetitions to succeed unsurprising, since information processing speed declines with age. But what also might be happening is that older adults use different strategies when they learn new routes, pointing out salient landmarks more than turns and intersections – which younger people tend to rely on.Gaze behaviour experiments are shedding further insights on these differences between young and old, particularly how each distinguishes between the location of objects. “Older healthy adults tend to make more use of external information, for instance windows and walls,” says Vladislava Segen, another member of the Bournemouth team. “But younger participants tend to look at the spatial arrangements of objects within a room, as well as flicking back and forth to external cues.”Segen thinks we could capitalise on these differences, drawing specifically upon cues that older adults prioritise. So paintings or different wall colours may be more helpful at intersections or room entrances, rather than yet another pot plant or a blank wall. Memory for landmarks also seems to be preserved in older adults, but they tend to have impaired memory of the sequence in which they are encountered. So switching the order of a pot plant or lampshade might impair navigation while, conversely, Hilton says, keeping these sequences consistent could avert spatial disorientation.Several of these findings apply to older people rather than those with dementia, however, and emphatically, dementia is not simply a consequence of ageing. But the strategies could be crucial for older people who either stay in their own homes or move to retirement housing. “If all environments were more dementia-friendly,” Wiener says, “we may be able to extend the time people can live independently.”As for VR testing in those with established Alzheimer’s, he acknowledges this has been difficult and so his experiments are shifting towards people with early signs of atypical Alzheimer’s, where working with residual capacities is vital: “I think what we can do – by designing environments to compensate for declining navigation abilities – is to smooth the transition from living in a well-known environment to moving into a care environment.”Discussing some of their recommendations with Mitchell, it becomes clear that they speak to her experience. Reflective surfaces and glare are especially problematic, she says. “I only have one small mirror in the house, which I rarely use as it’s disconcerting, especially when you live alone, to suddenly see a reflection. I find shiny floors look like water. There’s a new shopping arcade in Leeds where the floor is not only shiny but swirly and I have to look up when walking through it or I feel sick and very wobbly.”There are other unnerving experiences associated with dementia that could be diminished by design. For some, a black doormat appears as a hole. Or a kitchen floor develops a series of treacherous steps. Depth perception issues mean that abrupt changes in colour or tonal contrast of flooring are unsettling. Meanwhile, Mitchell has found that contrasting colours can help: “I painted a blue border around light switches to make them easier to see,” she explains, “and luminous yellow stripes on the steps outside – there are often simple cheap solutions, it’s just about having some imagination.”The architect Thomas Grey, a research fellow at TrinityHaus, believes many of the recommendations can be realised on a small budget, with minimum disruption. “But it is important to say that Universal Design and dementia-friendly housing is about helping a person to remain living at home for as long as possible and the value of this is hard to overestimate, both in terms of wellbeing and financial cost. Our home is so much more than a roof over our head – it is the place where most of our lives unfold.”Design for dementia may simply be design for everybody. Grey explains that Universal Design aims to provide an inclusive environment for people of all ages, sizes, abilities and disabilities – rather than designing exclusively for a distinct set of needs. “The conditions that support a person with dementia – a calm, coherent, orientating and gently stimulating environment – are good for all of us,” he says.These design ideas yield specific power though, in combatting confusion and disorientation in dementia. And, in the absence of a medical cure or transformative treatments, for some at least, design might just outdo drugs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03a938f49bd36c2732da79d0ba29d5e15d34c7b7/0_0_5323_3194/master/5323.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d8bbfe966b95b8652c9181899d63660","title":"sleep with as many women as i can lose girlfriend","story":"I know it’s selfish and that I might get caught, but I can’t help myself. The thrill of the chase is like an addictionI have a very nice and pretty girlfriend but I can’t help wanting to have sex with as many women as I can, even though I might get caught and lose her. It’s completely unfair on her and I fully realise this, but it’s the persuasion and the chase as much as anything. I’m middle-aged and the ladies tend to be in their early 30s. I’m orced with two youngish children. It’s selfish and I’m not sure it will make me happy in the long run, but it’s like an addiction. Is there anything to be done?You are not alone in having a high level of sexual desire, and there are people who would consider you very lucky. But while acting on your desires might be physically fulfilling in the short term, you seem to recognise that the choices you make could reduce your overall quality of life. Perhaps you are just not ready for monogamy if that is required by your girlfriend, you must decide whether you can comply or not. You were honest enough to mention being largely drawn to “the persuasion and the chase”, so it might be useful to consider what the real meaning of sex is for you beyond the erotic thrill itself. For some people, it is being validated as an attractive, socially adept, successful or sexually competent person, and a “conquest” is therefore affirming for those who lack confidence. For such people, the lure of this affirmation – especially from someone new – is very strong, and the pursuit of it can feel like an “addiction”. Try to improve your sense of self-worth in nonsexual ways. Hopefully you will be able to find new strategies to feel more secure as a man. Having strong sexual desire is a blessing, but, as you know, it presents many challenges. Misplaced, unchecked passion can spell social, career and familial disaster.

The customs partnership, under which the UK would collect EU import tariffs, has been dismissed as unworkable by Brussels and is intensely disliked by Brexiters, while “max fac” relies on complex and uncertain technological solutions.A third option will be seen as an attempt by Theresa May to break at least part of the deadlock as her ministers gather for a day-long retreat at the prime minister’s country home in an attempt to thrash out a vision for the UK’s future relationship with the EU.The decisions reached at the meeting will form the basis for an imminent and long-awaited white paper.With hopes fading of a bespoke wider agreement, senior government sources say ministers are broadly being asked to choose between an intimate, Norway-style partnership and a much looser, Canada-style trade deal.Leading cabinet Brexiters such as David Davis and Boris Johnson are vehemently resisting the idea of a Norway-type deal, which would leave the UK subject to some EU rules.However, allies of the foreign secretary and the Brexit secretary denied they were poised to resign if they lost Friday’s debate. A friend of Johnson’s said: “He’s not going anywhere: he’s always been of the view that he has more influence in the room.”Davis, who has long favoured what he calls a “Canada plus plus plus” approach – echoing Ottawa’s trade deal with the EU but covering services – has held a series of meetings with May in recent days.On Monday, the leading backbench Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg warned that for May to choose a softer option would prompt a rebellion among her MPs. The move would bring a party crisis on a scale of the repeal of the corn laws, he said.“Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised,” Rees-Mogg wrote in an article for the . “One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way. This left the Conservatives out of office for 28 years.”On Sunday, the housing minister, James Brokenshire, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show the government was determined to reach a clear resolution this week – and the outcome would be published in the white paper.“I think there’s no doubt that there are strong views on either side, and that’s what I would expect as we lead into the discussions on Friday,” he said. “But equally, I remain confident that we will come out from that meeting with that clear direction set out, and the white paper that will follow.”May will report back to MPs on Monday about last week’s European council meeting, at which leaders made a series of comments about indecision and isions in London.The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, said: “I don’t have to lecture Theresa May, but I would like our British friends to make clear their position. We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet.

The same documents – setting out M\u0026ampC’s appointment – state that an initial phase of the Saatchi campaign, which involves the agency having a base in Tunis, targets Tunisians aged 18 to 35. The country’s young people have been at the forefront of protests that have grown in intensity since the beginning of the year when the government raised prices of staples and introduced new taxes, as it comes under pressure to deliver on the reforms, which are linked to a $2.9bn (£2.2bn) IMF loan. The money for Saatchi is coming from the secretive Conflict, Security and Stability Fund (CSSF), which was set up under the auspices of several key government departments including the Foreign Office and the Department for International Development. It has been the focus of significant concern among MPs and the independent aid watchdog over the lack of transparency, accountability and leadership surrounding the £1.2bn pot.A report issued this year by the Independent Commission for Aid Impact, which scrutinises UK aid spending and reports to the Commons, also criticised serious shortcomings in the way that the programme operates, including the risk it could be working with human rights abusers.The assistance to the Tunisians comes against the backdrop of a move by the UK to focus more resources on the Sahel, which civil servants have identified as a breeding ground for extremism and source of migrants to Europe. Lloyd Russell-Moyle, a Labour MP on parliament’s international development committee, said: “I can think of no better example of the cynicism of this government than financing a PR campaign to support cuts to the Tunisian state by using state money in Britain that it claims is promoting peace and security overseas.“The government won’t tell the public or parliament what this fund, which is worth over £1bn, is spent on and the little evidence we do have suggests that the rot runs deep.”He added: “In light of these new allegations, it seems prudent to shut down the fund pending the review’s findings.”Asad Rehman, executive director of the charity War on Want, said that projects of the type undertaken in Tunisia “appear to be more about supporting governments with their PR rather than getting at the causes of the protests, which are rooted in deeply economic issues around inequality”.“People would be genuinely shocked to read that once again – whether it’s PFIs or something else – with British companies being brought in to aid governments in forcing through policies which are are highly contested, creates more friction and ultimately lead to a securitised response when people protest against them.”M\u0026ampC Saatchi were appointed to provide services only to the Cabinet Office and do not work directly with the Tunisian government on this project, according to the Foreign Office. The Foreign Office also pointed out that the ICAI report, while critical in parts, highlights a number of successes from fund’s programmes.M\u0026ampC Saatchi said it does not comment on government contracts.Tunisia, the country where the 2011 Arab spring uprisings began, has long been the company’s remaining bright spot, although there are fears that its democratic experiment could be put at risk by economic instability. Prime minister Youssef Chahed said earlier this year that his administration is working to reduce spending, revive exports and introduce social measures to meet the concerns of demonstrators.

When they have the all-clear, the tissue is put back and the women can go on to have babies naturally.For most patients the procedure is safe, but certain cancers, such as ovarian or leukaemia, can invade the ovarian tissue itself. This means that when frozen tissue is thawed and put back, there is a risk the disease will take hold again. For this reason, ovarian tissue freezing is rarely offered to high-risk patients.Susanne Pors and others at the Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen believe artificial ovaries could be a safer option. To make one, they used chemicals to strip donated ovarian tissue of all of its cells, including any lurking cancer cells. This left a bare tissue “scaffold” made largely of collagen, the protein that gives skin its strength. The doctors then seeded this scaffold with hundreds of human follicles, the tiny sacs that hold early-stage eggs.On Monday, Pors will tell the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Barcelona how the team implanted an artificial ovary holding 20 human follicles into a mouse and found that a quarter of them survived for at least three weeks. In that time, blood vessels had begun to grow around the ovary to keep it nourished in the animal.“This is the first proof that we can actually support these egg cells. It’s an important step along the road,” Pors told the . “But it will be many years before we can put this into a woman.” It could take five to 10 years of work before artificial ovaries are ready for human trials, she added.Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women’s Clinic, said that while there was a low risk of contracting cancer from frozen ovarian tissue, it is a danger that doctors take seriously. “There have been certain cancers where we can’t use this procedure because of this concern,” he said. “It’s an exciting development. This is early days for the work but it’s a very interesting proof of concept.”Stuart Lavery, a consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, added: “It’ll be very reassuring, if this work reaches fruition, that patients can have the transplantation knowing there is no risk of transplanting the cancer back into them. The beauty of this is that many of the women who have ovarian grafts go and get pregnant naturally, they don’t have to go through IVF.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4997a9d9f244bceb1aa859f8053e723a2480b35e/796_57_2759_1657/master/2759.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99620952eaeb37873bcca1cfb260d844","title":"lebron james free agency philadelphia 76ers nba","story":"LeBron James is leaving home for Hollywood and an iconic team.The NBA’s best player announced on Sunday night that he has agreed to a four-year, $154m contract with the Lakers, joining one of the league’s most storied franchises and switching conferences to try and dethrone the Golden State Warriors and grow his own legacy.For the second time in his career, James is saying goodbye to the Cleveland Cavaliers, who drafted James as a teenager in 2003 and must make do with winning just one title in the 11 years they had him. James won another two titles with the Miami Heat.James thanked Cleveland in an Instagram story. “Thank you Northeast Ohio for an incredible 4 seasons. This will always be home,” he wrote over a picture of the Cavs’ 2016 NBA title parade.His agency announced his agreement with the Lakers in a release. It was a stark contrast from eight years ago, when a poorly conceived TV special to announce his departure from Cleveland backfired and damaged James’ image.The game’s biggest star will now lead a young Lakers team run by Lakers Hall of Famer Magic Johnson that has been overmatched in recent years while rebuilding. But the Lakers will instantly rise with James, a three-time champion who after being swept by the Warriors in this year’s NBA finals said he is still driven and very much in “championship mode.” Los Angeles will also provide James with a larger platform for his business interests and social activism. He already owns two homes in southern California and has a film production company.This is the third time in eight years James has changed teams. After leaving Cleveland in 2010, he returned in an emotional homecoming four years later, determined to make the Cavs champions. The 33-year-old had previously said he wanted to finish his career in Ohio, and although he’s leaving again, Cavs fans are more forgiving after he ended the city’s 52-year sport title drought in 2016.James informed the Cavs on Friday that he was not exercising his $35.6m option and becoming a free agent. While in Los Angeles following a family vacation, he spoke to Cavs general manager Koby Altman moments after free agency opened on Sunday, and it appears that was more a courtesy than a chance for Cleveland to make one last pitch.The decision to join the Lakers was not a surprise to his innermost circle, with one person telling AP that it had been presumed for some time that he was headed to Los Angeles next season.James gave Cleveland something to remember in his final season. He played in all 82 regular-season games and then somehow carried a team that underwent several transformations to a fourth straight conference title and match-up against the Warriors. As has been the case in the past, James didn’t have enough help as the Cavs were swept, dropping him to 3-6 in the NBA finals a record sometimes unfairly used to compare him to Michael Jordan.His stay with the Cavaliers will best be remembered for 2016, when he rallied the Cavs from a 3-1 deficit in the finals to stun the Warriors. James helped seal a Game 7 win with a chase-down block of Andre Iguodala, the signature moment of a career that has shown no signs of decay.With the Lakers, James will be playing in the Western Conference for the first time and just down the Pacific Coast Highway from the Warriors, the team that has stymied him three times in the past four finals.The chance to play for one of America’s most storied franchises was appealing to James, who prides himself on knowing the game’s history. In Los Angeles, championships are the standard and he’ll feel new pressure in upholding the legacies of Johnson, Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jerry West and other Lakers greats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34b00fae226e5140bf7780d63d08730a48011a1/0_460_2376_1424/master/2376.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4203b4fd974a4662ba321e5362c4b196","title":"leeds sack brian mcdermott","story":"Leeds have sacked their head coach Brian McDermott following a club record seven successive Super League losses.McDermott succeeded Brian McClennan in October 2010 and went on to guide Leeds to glory in four Grand Finals, as well as two Challenge Cups and a World Club Challenge.The Rhinos were crowned league champions last October but have endured a chastening run in recent weeks, and a 46-8 loss to Wigan last Thursday left them clinging to a top-eight place.“It is always disappointing to announce the departure of someone who has contributed so much to our club’s success and Brian McDermott has certainly done that,” the club’s chief executive, Gary Hetherington, said.McDermott was backed when Leeds dropped into the Qualifiers two years ago and they responded by retaining their top-flight place before toppling Castleford in last season’s Grand Final.However, they have had to cope with another injury crisis this year – at one point they had 12 senior players on the sidelines – and have not won in the league since beating Hull KR at the end of April.Hetherington added: “Brian is a man of the utmost integrity and passion for rugby league. He has so much to offer the sport and I have no doubt he will go on to achieve more success in the future. Leeds Rhinos will be forever indebted to his contribution.“The club’s most successful coach has also helped to forge a rugby operation with toughness, resilience and a strong desire to succeed, which his successor will inherit. That search will now begin in earnest.“Eight years is a long time for any head coach at the same club and we have enjoyed much success and endured some difficult times along the way when tough decisions had to be made.“We have always come through strongly but I do believe our present predicament requires change and that this is the right call for the club.”McDermott had been the league’s longest-serving coach and the defeat to the Warriors last week was his 265th game in charge. The 48-year-old former Bradford and Great Britain prop had been confident Leeds were “going to come good” in the closing weeks of the season.He leaves them eighth in the standings while they have reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup and will face Warrington on 5 August.McDermott said: “I am extremely disappointed this has happened and obviously it is not a decision I agree with. I wish everyone at the club the best and my thoughts will be with the team on Sunday and through to the end of the season.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54a2943038fe620208a2fae2c007689ad5799724/0_115_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=460af14a6c8dc57265e648f0633051b7","title":"tennis is due its own metoo moment judy murray says","story":"Highly respected coach says abuse in the women’s game is an open secretTennis is due its own #MeToo moment and women should be able to speak out about abuse they have suffered within the game, Judy Murray has said as Wimbledon begins.In an interview with the  before the tournament, which starts on Monday, the highly respected coach, whose sons Andy and Jamie are both former Wimbledon champions, said it was an open secret that there was abuse in the women’s game.“I think anybody would tell you that there are examples,” she said. “I think everybody who’s on the circuit would be able to name you something that isn’t quite right. It’s very easy for a young, inexperienced player to be taken advantage of ... I would certainly advocate for anybody who has been the victim of abuse in that coaching relationship to speak about it.”Asked whether she thought it would happen, Murray said: “It only needs one person to start it off.” Murray said that when women first begin on the tour they are often very young, their bodies are changing and they can be vulnerable and lonely, with little mixing between players compared with the men’s tour, where there is greater camaraderie. While supportive of women speaking up about abuse they have suffered, she warned that it was difficult to do so, particularly when young. When asked whether tennis would have its #MeToo moment, Murray said: “It’s really about the women getting to the stage in their life where they feel confident enough to speak out. Who do you speak to? “There should be an independent sports body, where players can go where they know someone will listen to them and they know someone will act on it – whether that’s emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Often you’re scared to speak because you think it will prejudice people against you.”She added: “If you’re a young female player and you’re travelling the world, you often have nobody to talk to ... I noticed how little the girls would go out for dinner together. “Players tend to spend most of their time with their coach or hitting partner and often they are guys – guys who are quite a bit older than them. Who do these young girls talk to if they have got emotional or physical problems? You can’t talk to a guy that you’re largely employing.”Since the inception of the #MeToo movement in 2017, after dozens of women accused the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, rape, harassment and misconduct – he denies any allegations of nonconsensual sex – it has spread to a wide range of fields. However, its impact on the world of sport has been limited. Probably the most high-profile instance was when Olympic gold medal winners McKayla Maroney and Simone Biles used #MeToo to reveal they were sexually abused by former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was already facing criminal charges for molesting other gymnasts. Nassar was later jailed for up to 125 years and still faces further charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f14df56d8cb33e9afd53f91181f8cff1a22fd635/1654_633_3233_1940/master/3233.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68dd46a8c4e1981a1560e9c7ef48d5de","title":"james acaster interview netflix series repertoire latitude","story":"Kettering-born James Acaster, 33, a drummer turned comic, has been nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award a record five consecutive times. His current Netflix mini-series, Repertoire, comprises four hour-long standup performances. He is appearing at the Latitude festival, Suffolk, on 14 July.You’re the first British comic to shoot more than one Netflix special. What’s\u0026nbspyour series about?It’s four standup shows themed around the justice system: one about\u0026nbspbeing an undercover cop, one about jury service, one about committing a crime and one about witness protection. There’s also a hidden narrative running underneath that becomes apparent as they\u0026nbspprogress.Episode 2’s synopsis says it covers\u0026nbsp“light celebrity gossip” – about\u0026nbspwhom?Certain celebs manage to worm their way out of the spotlight and I won’t stand for that. So I’ve dug up some dirt on the Chilean miners. If you want the truth about those cult heroes from 2010, watch my show.In episode three, you compare Brexit to a teabag. Can you explain?The referendum was like making a cup of peppermint tea. You had to decide whether to leave the teabag in or take it out. If you leave it in, the cup of tea as a whole is stronger. Even\u0026nbspthough it appears that the teabag itself is getting weaker, it’s still part of a strong cup of tea. But if you take the teabag out, the cup of tea as a whole is weaker – and the teabag itself goes directly in the bin. That’s essentially it. You’d be amazed at how angry Brexiteers get about it. If you voted Leave, try not to lose your mind in the comments section or on social media about what’s quite a whimsical\u0026nbspmetaphor.You wear a different shade of corduroy in each show, colour-coded to the stage backdrop. Why?One website called it “Four Colours Corduroy”. It developed by accident. I gradually found myself wearing corduroy in autumnal tones, then started matching my outfit to the backdrop. Corduroy hits the sweet spot between jeans and slacks. They’re a trouser middleman. Smooth chinos seem like the natural next step.Your father, David, tweeted an underwhelming compliment about you that went viral: “He’s not for everyone but he works hard.” Did he enjoy Twitter fame?It was funny and my dad totally got why. People identified with it because a lot of dads are like that – proud and affectionate but somehow always bumbling the compliment. To be fair, it’s true: I’m not for everyone and I\u0026nbspdo work hard. It’s the word “but” that made it.More effusively, Billy Connolly said: “James Acaster on Netflix is a scream.” Was that flattering?It meant an awful lot. He’s an icon, someone I grew up watching, loving and being inspired by, so I was delighted. It was surreal and lovely.You were nominated for the Edinburgh comedy award five times in a row. Have you perfected your gracious runner-up face?It’s never an issue. It’s always been a nice thing. I was surprised to be nominated once, so five times is way beyond my expectations. Forget winning, I’m definitely proud of that.You appeared on Have I Got News for You recently. What was the gender split of your episode? Is equality improving in comedy?Three men and two women. There’s no excuse for panel games, other TV comedy shows or even live bills to be made up mainly of men. Most of the best standup I’ve seen in the last five years has been by women: Bridget Christie, Luisa Omielan, Rose Matafeo, Lolly Adefope, Lou Sanders, Felicity Ward, Hannah Gadsby, Kiri Pritchard-McLean… They’re obliterating it on the circuit and need to be seen on TV more. It’s getting better, but still isn’t enough. There’s a long way to go.You’re one of the headline comics at Latitude. Looking forward to it?Very much. Music festivals are a different vibe. You’re often on in broad daylight, with sound-bleed from bands. The audience might be sitting on the grass, chilling out and drinking. You have to adjust and embrace that, rather than being precious and fighting\u0026nbspit.Will you be sticking around for the rest of the festival?Possibly, but I won’t be camping. I absolutely loathe sleeping in a tent, regardless of the weather. If it’s hot, you wake up at 6am, boiling, sweaty and somehow panicky that you’ve overslept. You want to get out but you’re naked, so have to wash yourself with wet wipes before you can emerge. If it’s raining, it’s even worse. It’s gross. Why do we do this to ourselves?Your shows have had one-word titles. Will the next one be the same?This new show is a deliberate departure. It’s called COLD LASAGNE HATE MYSELF 1999, all in caps lock.

I got them a long time ago at the Iron Market in Port-au-Prince. I cannot remember whether they had anything to do with voodoo, but when I got home I did not like them as much as I thought I did when I was (probably) having a pathetic and (almost certainly) unsuccessful attempt to haggle for them in a hot market a long way from home. They went into a box. It is probably why my life has been cursed ever since.I went to Haiti because I was young and stupid and thought it would be an interesting place for a holiday. It was interesting, to be fair, but it did not feel much like a holiday. Mostly, I remember wondering what to do and pretending not to be scared.Romesh Ranganathan does not even pretend he is not scared. “Having spent the 14-hour flight imagining the myriad of ways I might get killed, I arrived in a state of high alert,” he says. Actually, I think he is pretending to be more scared than he is (he has got a security guard with him), but then that is his shtick, better and funnier than the other way around, the macho way. And it is sort of the point Romesh is going to the places others avoid because of their reputation. He is also going to Ethiopia and Albania. Albania? I thought it was the new Croatia!Anyway, he arrives at his famous Port-au-Prince hotel, which has scary voodoo figures in the garden (“I mean, that is genuinely terrifying,” he says, not sounding that genuinely terrified). In the morning sunlight, he cannot even pretend to be scared by them. “Look at that, there’s a penis with spines on it,” he says, pointing at a penis with spines on it.Romesh hooks up with local journalist Jeremy Dupin, who shows him around. They go by tuk-tuk, listening to raboday music (a sort of Haitian grime), to the area Jeremy grew up in and meet a few of his mates. It is loud and chaotic. And they drop in on Marinad 007, the raboday artist whose song they were listening to before. I hope Romesh returns the favour if Jeremy ever comes to London. Stormzy? Sure we can, we’ll drop in for a cup of tea … Marinad 007 turns out to be a man of few words it is a bit awkward. But he performs for them. Romesh gets involved and comes in with a few English bars: Oh my gosh, I’m here with a MarinadRomesh, and you know that I’m super badI’m with the mic, here with JeremyTo get me off the mic you’re going have to bury meI’m here, I’m not HaitianMy name’s Romesh Ranganathan.Ha! Love it. And that it’s not all about the history, colonialism, the Duvaliers, Tontons Macoute, but about what’s happening in Haiti, culturally, today.It is about poverty, and the 2010 earthquake, because it is impossible for a visit to Port-au-Prince not to be. And Romesh is clearly (certainly more believably than the fear thing) shocked by some of the things he sees. But he manages not to be hand-wringingly worthy about it. I like the way he is with people – not all overly polite because they’re poor and foreign, but just the same as he is with everyone else, deadpan – and if that sometimes leads to misunderstandings and awkwardness, well that is all right. It is – he is – very funny. And he gets a nice thing going with Jeremy – teasing, warm, genuine, that one I do believe. It is not my favourite TV genre, the celebrity travelogue, but if I have to go somewhere with someone, then I don’t mind going with Ranganathan.He does go to the Iron Market, which has been badly damaged in a fire (Haiti really doesn’t get any luck, does it?) since it was rebuilt after being completely destroyed in the earthquake. He gets a load of stuff: a small chair, seven brightly coloured scarves, good-luck shampoo, rum, black fish, etc, that he needs for the inevitable voodoo ceremony. Which takes place away from town at what looks like a lovely place by the sea. Obviously, the ceremony is absolutely terrifying … Is it really, Romesh? He is honest about Haiti as a tourist destination at least. It might not be for everyone. That sounds about right.My wooden figures? Well, they must have had something to do with voodoo, because I did what we do with unwanted stuff in my area I put them out on the pavement in the hope that someone would take them away. And someone did, since when things have gone relatively well.

At the event, the group, which included Geert Wilders of the Dutch Party for Freedom and Harald Vilimsky of Austria’s Freedom party, launched their campaign ahead of the European elections. Le Pen, with whom Salvini has nurtured a friendship for some time, warned that a far-right majority in the vote could “change Europe”.The party’s anti-immigration policies currently have the upper hand within the coalition, with Salvini reiterating on Friday that Italy’s ports would be closed to all NGOs involved in rescuing migrants from the Mediterranean for the entire summer, a period when arrivals peak, and that those on board “will only see Italy in a postcard”. His renewed pledge came the same day the EU’s 28 leaders struck a deal on how to handle refugees and irregular migrants. The deal was reached amid intense pressure from Italy and after a ship carrying over 600 rescued migrants was forced to ert to Spain after Salvini blocked entry.Salvini said his government’s tough approach towards immigration and in negotiations with the EU had achieved more than its predecessors had done in six years.“The happiness of a people comes first,” Salvini proclaimed at the rally, drawing rousing cheers. Salvini asked rally attendees if they would “swear, yes or no, to liberate the peoples from this Europe”.“Yes!” came the resounding reply from the crowd.

I was waiting for anyone to say I look tired. I promise I am not too bad I really just don’t have any make-up on, so that’s probably why I have a bit more bags under the eyes than usual ... but we are doing great, we are doing really great.”National party finance spokeswoman Amy Adams said 1.7 million New Zealanders would be worse off under the families package. “Changes such as higher fuel taxes, rent increases and higher income taxes are costing Kiwi families over $100 a week,” said Adams. “And that’s an unacceptable burden on New Zealanders who are trying to get ahead.”Ardern signed off her video in typical fashion – with a smile– and promised to read through the thousands of comments soon. “But in the meantime I am going to sit here with my human hot-water bottle, and thanks everyone for the lovely messages.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba9d63f93797e3491e81ed6ad8012fdfd231a177/0_191_3360_2016/master/3360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56113feb05d1137577f07d8292561e5c","title":"mexicans celebrate new president andres manuel lopez obrador","story":"They poured on to the streets bearing banners and flags, united in joy and disbelief.“I still can’t believe it,” said Victor Gómez, one of thousands of Andrés Manuel López Obrador supporters who had descended on downtown Mexico City on Sunday night to toast their leader’s historic election victory.Gómez, a 47-year-old artist, had brought a date to the fast-growing fiesta on the Paseo de la Reforma, a wide avenue running through the Mexican capital: a papier-mache sculpture portraying the leftist president-elect as a caped superhero. “We’ve seen too many years of cynicism too many years of theft, of lies, of hypocrisy,” he complained. “I want to believe things can change.”Gómez was not alone. Around him, at the foot of the Ángel de la Independencia monument, hundreds of other joyous lópezobradoristas hugged, cheered, cried, leaped into the air and waved their country’s green, white and red flag. “Presidente! Presidente! Presidente!” they chanted. “Obrador! Obrador! Obrador!”Down the road, thousands more had packed into the capital’s main plaza, the Zócalo, to hear their leader give an exultant victory speech in which he vowed to transform Mexico and rule for the poor and forgotten.“I’m happy, happy, happy – at last we got the guy we wanted,” beamed Antonio Hernández Vasquez, 63, a small-business owner who said he had been rooting for López Obrador, or Amlo as most Mexicans call him, since his first presidential run in 2006.“It is the first time in many years that we will have an honest president, an upright president,” Vasquez said of Amlo, who made eradicating rampant corruption and political sleaze the backbone of his third bid to become commander-in-chief. “He will change Mexico for the better.” As the scale of Amlo’s triumph became clear, the street party swelled and Mexico City’s historic centre erupted into a joyful cacophony of car horns and revving engines. “This is a historic day for us,” said Luiz Gerardo, a 23-year-old English teacher. “Now we’ve a chance to feel hope.”“I feel so emotional … Amlo offers the possibility of a better life for us all,” said Eckert Baca, a 33-year-old entrepreneur, who believed Amlo would come to the resucue of the 53 million Mexicans still stuck in poverty. Baca had brought a pink highlighter pen and a pad of A4 paper to the party and was using them to make posters celebrating Amlo’s best-known catchphrases. One read: “Abrazos, no balazos” (“Hugs not gunfire”), a reference to Amlo’s pledge to de-escalate the calamitous 11-year war on drugs. Another said: “The change has already begun.” But the ecstasy in central Mexico City on Sunday night was tempered with realism. “We know it is just a small step. We know that even as president Amlo won’t magically end corruption,” said Javier Giménez, a 47-year-old actor.

It has set up two reception centres and what it says is a temporary camp near the border in Rakhine to receive the first arrivals. Maurer’s comments, made at the refugee camps on Bangladesh’s south-eastern coast, followed his visit to Myanmar, where he said he saw abandoned villages and destroyed houses. A Myanmar government spokesman was not immediately available for comment on Maurer’s remarks. The exodus of Rohingya came after militant attacks on Myanmar security posts triggered a military offensive that the United Nations has called a “textbook example of ethnic cleansing”. Myanmar has denied the allegations and stated it waged a legitimate counter-insurgency operation. Red Cross has become the main provider of humanitarian aid to Myanmar’s northern Rakhine state since the UN had to suspend its operations there in September last year, following government accusations that its agency had supported Rohingya insurgents. Rohingya who have fled Buddhist-majority Myanmar have reported mass killings, arson and rape by security forces there. The country does not recognise the Rohingya as an indigenous ethnic group and denies them citizenship. The United Nations struck an outline deal with Myanmar at the end of May aimed at eventually allowing hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims sheltering in Bangladesh to return safely and by choice. But Rohingya will have no explicit guarantees of citizenship or freedom of movement in Myanmar, according to details of the agreement Reuters reported on Friday. Many Rohingya living at the refugee camps in Bangladesh have said they will not return until Myanmar recognises them as citizens and their safety is guaranteed. The government did not respond to enquiries about the agreement. Maurer said he said he met senior government officials in Myanmar’s capital, Naypyitaw, to seek approvals to increase Red Cross operations in Rakhine state. He said he was satisfied with the cooperation from the security forces as well as the government to reach people in need."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e6a5a777c95811e72405583ac10165d22c87b44/0_268_3872_2324/master/3872.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96cce205ea1600b04fb906afefd8d21c","title":"world cup brazil players single mothers","story":"Tournament has thrown spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories resonate with ordinary BraziliansRound the corner from a gang member with a pistol in his waistband and an automatic rifle in his hands, the Women’s Bar in Rio’s Complexo do Alemão favela was showing the World Cup on a big TV.Among the crowd watching the Brazil-Serbia game, women in team shirts outnumbered men, while children bounced on a trampoline or queued to have Brazilian flags painted on their cheeks.“You meet everyone here. There’s a great vibe,” said Maira Quirino, 26 – who like many of those at the bar – is a single mother. The Seleção has so far had a successful if unspectacular World Cup. But away from the pitch, this tournament has thrown the spotlight on the player’s mothers whose hard-luck life stories appear to resonate with ordinary Brazilians in a way that the team’s more glamorous wives and girlfriends do not.According to a widely-shared story in the Brazilian edition of El País, six of the players who lined up against Serbia – Miranda, Thiago Silva, Marcelo, Casemiro, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus – grew up without fathers. Many of Brazil’s great players have come from backgrounds of crushing poverty.And their mothers connect with ordinary Brazilian women because they have lived similar lives, said Debora Diniz, a professor of anthropology at the University of Brasília. That contrasts with the upscale lifestyle enjoyed by of players’ wives and girlfriends – who in many cases are lighter-skinned, unlike the team which is a typically Brazilian racial mix.In Brazil – and other South American countries – feminism is on the rise and the issues it raises are increasingly discussed on television soap operas, said Leticia Bahia, a consultant to the United Nations Foundation and co-founder of feminist site AzMina. “The idea that you have to stay in a marriage because of the children has really collapsed,” she said.At the Women’s Bar, Quirino’s friend Daiane Oliveira, 23 – who has the name of her daughter Camilly, 7, tattooed on her calf – said Brazilian mothers are increasingly choosing to go it alone if relationships aren’t working out. “Brazilian women today are independent. They don’t need men for anything.”A grimmer factor in Brazil’s growing number of single mothers is the country’s ban on abortion, which forces many women into unwanted pregnancies, said Thaiz Leão, 28, who runs a Facebook page called Mãe Solo (Single Mother) with 80,000 followers.“The father can abandon the child and the woman cannot,” Leão said. Brazil’s entrenched machismo is also a factor, she said: many men regard infidelity as their birthright and refuse to help at home. “We deserve better relationships,” Leão said.For many women, the spotlight on the team’s mothers has been been a timely reminder of where the players came from. “None of them are middle class,” said Mariluce Souza, 36, who runs the Favela Art project in the Complexo do Alemão.Vera Lúcia, mother of Manchester City and Brazil forward Gabriel Jesus, is a former maid who raised him and his three brothers alone. Now, however, she often appears on chat shows and toured Russia – alongside Neymar’s mother Nadine and Fernandinho’s mother Ane – for a six-part TV Globo series called As Matrioskas – The Russian Dolls. Her strong, supportive relationship with her 21-year-old son, a star at Manchester City, resonated with mothers in the crowd at the Women’s Bar.“Gabriel Jesus is from a favela and was raised by his mother,” says Rita de Cassia, 38, a single mother of three children – the middle of whom, Andry, 12, also dreams of becoming a footballer. Brazil’s World Cup focus on footballing sons and mothers from tough neighbourhoods was encapsulated in a photograph which went viral earlier this monthWallace Rocha, 12, from Rio’s Vila Cruzeiro favela wanted a shirt with midfielder Philippe Coutinho’s name, but neither his mother, Sandra de Oliveira, 47, an unemployed cleaner, nor his stepfather could afford one. De Oliveira asked a local seamstress to knock one up, promising to pay later. Photographer Bruno Itan captured the pair watching Brazil beat Costa Rica photo – then launched an online campaign to get it to Coutinho.The photo went viral and four hours later, Coutinho replied with a video message.Wallace too wants to become a footballer, his mother said. “It’s my dream too,” she said. “It’s a good profession for him, to get him off the streets.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3547008.1530195823!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sky s the limit customer foiled as he tries to cancel broadband contract","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRepeated calls to Sky failed to produce the desired response for the frustrated customer. Photograph: David JonesPAA reader named Paul Davy got in touch because he wanted us to know about what he called Sky’s Hotel California policy, a policy which, he says, means “you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave”.He has spent much of the past 12 months trying to cancel his Sky broadband account to no avail so far and in his mail he promises a “quick” version of the story but – to be honest – it is not at all quick so you might want to settle in.“I was approached by an eir salesman in May 2017 as they were installing fibre in our remote area of Co Galway and he advised that if we didn’t sign up with eir we’d be waiting more than two years for Sky fibre,” his story starts.Davy says he found the salesman “a bit pushy”, and having had Sky TV for eight years and its broadband for around three years “albeit with miserable download speeds” he decided to contact\u0026nbspSky before he signed with eir.He did that on May 25th last year “and they confirmed I was out of contract but also advised that if my neighbours were getting fibre from eir then there was no reason that Sky couldn’t provide me with fibre – more or less rubbishing what the eir salesman had told me,” he says.So he renewed his contract with Sky “on the clear understanding that what they were telling me was correct”, he says.“I can still hear myself spelling that out as a condition of renewal and Sky reconfirming that if my neighbours have fibre I’ll have fibre through Sky. I was even willing to wait one or two months for the fibre.”He never got his fibre. He called Sky “a few times” over the next few months, each time giving them a history of events, and each time he says he was given conflicting information.Last September a Sky agent confirmed the company couldn’t provide fibre in his\u0026nbsparea “as eir had pulled in new lines to my neighbours and hadn’t released them yet to other providers. As I was running a home office on still miserable download\u0026nbspspeeds I cancelled Sky broadband and phone that day”, Davy says.He was, however, persuaded to keep the TV package with the promise of a discount. Then he signed up for eir fibre and phone and the Sky agent confirmed that he would send the cancellation request to the relevant department.He got his eir fibre installed a few days later “without any hassle”, and all was well. Then he realised Sky were still taking the full amount of direct debit out of his account when they should have only be charging him for his discounted TV package.He contacted Sky again on October 6th. An agent confirmed his cancellation had not been processed but she said she would contact the Cancellation Department and ring him back that day. The agent did not call back that day but he missed a call from her the following day “and she left a message to say she’d call me the following Wednesday – four days later”.The call came as promised. The agent said there would be an early disconnection charge as I was cancelling “in contract”. Davy disputed this and asked for transcripts of his calls with Sky to prove his case.“The forms I was supposed to sign requesting the transcripts never arrived and I let it slip for a while as I was very busy in work and didn’t have time during the day to be still following this up,” he says.Then in early January “with full direct debits still going out to Sky” he spoke to another agent and went through the story again.Time passed and he contacted Sky again as the transcript request form wanted him to submit £10 (sterling) when returning it. The company confirmed they’d sent out the wrong form and that he shouldn’t have to pay anything and that they would send out a new transcript form in the post.“I finally got the transcripts in the post toward the end of February 2018 but it came in the form of 40 pages of every transaction and call in Excel format, a hard copy of emails sent to me and a CD Rom – hello – who still has a CD player on their laptop in this day and age? I mean Sky can reboot your TV from India so you think they could email me the call recordings? I also had to call Sky again as the form requested €5 this time – I was told that I was misinformed and that there was a €5 fee but if I paid it that Sky would credit me for same.”Again Davy let it slip for a spell as he was very busy in work “and needed to source an old laptopPC with a CD player. But when I finally did source one last weekend, the security ‘passphrase’ they emailed me separately to open the CD did not work. I’ll be contacting them yet again today advising of same, but either way I know I renewed in good faith on the basis that Sky could offer me fibre like eir.”Apart from the efforts to get the transcripts he has also contacted Sky on numerous occasions to cancel his broadband and having been as polite as humanly possible all along, “on one occasion I finally lost it a little when pitted against an alpha male supervisor who had raised the tone of our conversation to a higher level, when I uttered the words \u0027get your head out of your ass for a minute\u0027\u0026nbspit was duly followed by \u0027I’m now terminating this call\u0027. I mean I work in construction and that’s about the least vulgar thing you can say to someone in conversation,” he says.“On another occasion I was told I could only cancel Sky exactly a month before the renewal date and not before. So I did ring Sky on 25th April 2018, someone in the Cancellation Department listened to my summary of the whole fiasco and confirmed that she’d process the cancellation herself, do a follow-up on the 14th May 2018 to make sure it went through and also confirmed when I asked the question that \u0027nothing can go wrong\u0027\u0026nbspwith it this time”.“He did call back 10 minutes later and promised to sort things out within the Cancellation Department and call me back later that day. I haven’t heard anything from anyone in Sky since and am beginning to think that this is some kind of sick game that the Sky Cancellation Department play on people or maybe it’s just with me.”He says what he would like is the cancellation of his broadband, a refund of his money, and “an official apology from Sky to acknowledge that you can’t treat people like this and you can’t continually give them misinformation depending on what operator they’re talking to”.He also said he would like “compensation for the wasted hours on the phone where you’ve got to psych yourself up to make the call in the first place, go through their voice recorded options, utter the words “Cancel Broadband” for the umpteenth time when they ask you to clearly describe how they can help you today, relay your life story to another poor unfortunate Sky operator who you know sympathises with you but are only doing their job and probably have another 10 or 20 Paul Davys to listen to after your call finishes”.We got in touch with the company and received the following statement.“Having investigated the case highlighted we wish to apologise to the affected customer. We pride ourselves on providing customers with a high standard of customer service and acknowledge that the customer’s experience in this instance did not meet those standards. We have reached out to the customer and have resolved this matter.”"},{"url":null,"title":"dublin s pride parade wows the city as thousands take to the streets","story":"  June 30, 2018This year\u0026rsquos event marks 25 years since the decriminalisation of homosexuality   June 30, 2018LGBTI+ activists express concerns that the event is now more of a festival than a protest   July 2, 2018None more gloriously cynical about creeping commercialisation than LGBT+ community "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550478.1530485096!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"do the right thing and observe hosepipe ban says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: “I really would appeal to people to heed the advice and not to use hosepipes”.

What does that mean? What is covered? How long will it last? And how will it be enforced? The month-long ban was introduced on Monday, to last until at least July 31st, at which point it may be extended. The ban prohibits people using their garden hose, with a few minor exceptions. People will not be allowed to use a hosepipe to water their garden or potted plants, wash their car or boat, or fill a paddling pool, pond, or water fountain. People can still water their garden and plants using a watering can, and fill a paddling pool with buckets of water filled from the tap. The hosepipe ban on filling ponds does not apply if there is fish in the garden pond. The ban is in place 247 for the next month. At the moment the hosepipe ban is only in place across the wider Dublin region, but Irish Water said there are over 100 other areas across the country at risk of water shortages, where it is considering a hosepipe ban to conserve supply. Decisions to extend the ban to other areas are likely, but will be considered on a scheme by scheme basis. In the meantime night time water restrictions are in place across several parts of the country, to help conserve supply. In the south of the country 27 local water schemes have been severely affected by drought, including parts of Kilkenny, Carlow, Waterford, Limerick and Kerry. People can report their neighbours or anyone they see breaking the ban. A tip line to report excessive water use is available at 1850 278 278. The water utility said they have added additional staff to man the phone line over the next month. The phone line can also be used to ask staff general water conservation queries. A spokeswoman from Irish Water said staff would follow up on reports, and take actions where they found “excessive and continuous usage” of water.If Irish Water deem someone has committed an offence in breaching the conservation order, they can be fined €125, and prosecuted if they do not pay within 21 days. Legislation allowing Irish Water to introduce a hosepipe ban is covered under the Water Services Act 2000, which gives the utility the power in cases of “serious deficiency” of water supply. Irish Water have introduced the restrictions in Dublin as demand for water is outstripping how much the utility can supply. The greater Dublin water schemes can produce 610 million litres of treated water a day. Currently nearly all of that is being used, since the heatwave started. This is compared to an average 565m litres a day used over the summer last year. During the peak of the heatwave in the second half of last week, up to 615m litres a day was being drawn down in Dublin. The exceptionally high temperatures over the last week have also led to dropping water levels in lakes and rivers, and the dry weather has also meant a lack of rain. Water reserves are being stretched to the limit, with the Pollaphuca reservoir on the Liffey being drained so quickly it may have knock on effects for water supply later in the summer, and even into the autumn, Irish Water have said. At the moment the conservation order is in place for the month on July. A spokeswoman for Irish Water said they will “continue to monitor all water supplies and will provide updates if any extension is required.”“We have a collective community responsibility for the conservation of water, as they do in other countries when a hosepipe ban is in place,” the spokeswoman said. Irish Water have also called on people to take steps to conserve the amount of water they use generally. People are being asked to take showers instead of baths, and to take shorter showers. Turn off the tap when brushing your teeth, and only run the dishwasher and washing machine on full loads. If watering your plants with a watering can, Irish Water said people should do so in the early morning or evening, to limit evaporation. When it comes to flushing the toilet, Irish Water’s conservation advice is to “let the yellow mellow,” as flushing the toilet is one of the biggest uses of water in the household. People are being asked to “consider only flushing the toilet when you really need to,” the utility have said.

Photograph:  Frank MillerJust three nurses have been recruited so far this year as part of the HSE’s relocation package.The “Bring them Home” campaign was put in place by the HSE in July 2015, offering Irish nurses working in Britain a relocation grant of €1,500 to return to the Irish public health service.Since April 2017, an additional €1,500 is paid after a period of 12 months employment and subject to a commitment to remain in that employment for a further year. Last year, it was decided to extend the package beyond Britain to include nurses from any overseas location.There were 15 nurses recruited last year, down from 82 in 2016 and 20 in 2015, according to figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.The HSE said upon its announcement three years ago it was hoping to attract up to 500 staff under the initiative.Irish Midwives and Nurses Organisation general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha said that while it was important to have packages to incentivise Irish nurses to come back, the current offering was insufficient.“The figures demonstrate that it doesn’t go far enough, it has to be much higher. In addition, the incentive to stay also has to be included,” she said.“What we found is some who availed of the first part of the incentive left after six months. Recruitment is only one part of the story – retention is an even bigger part. The rate of pay is too low within a global market where you can get better rates.”The HSE said it could not provide a comment on the figures at this time but pointed to the health service employment report published last May, which showed a 4.6 per cent increase in the number of nurses employed over the previous year, from 36,474 to 38,139."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550450.1530476322!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"up to 24 medical negligence cases since 2002 include confidentiality clause","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told. Photograph: Nick BradshawConfidentiality clauses have been stitched into as many as 24 medical negligence cases settled out of court over the past 15 years, the State Claims Agency director has said.Appearing before an Oireachtas committee, Ciaran Breen said there were “perhaps two dozen” clinical cases where settlements were made with a condition that the patient did not reveal the circumstances involved.The number of cases involving gagging clauses since the Health Service Executive (HSE) adopted a policy of open disclosure has been “virtually nil”, he added.The HSE’s open disclosure policy, official guidelines on telling patients and their families when something has gone wrong in their healthcare, was adopted just five years ago but it is not mandatory.Cian O’Carroll, solicitor for Vicky Phelan, who exposed the CervicalCheck scandal, said there are potentially other scandals lurking behind the dozens of confidentiality agreements.“I can say that on the basis that I personally strongly suspect that there is a very significant scandal lurking behind the BreastCheck figures,” he said. “That is the starting point, after that whatever else is there has yet to be uncovered.”Mr O’Carroll said BreastCheck “tacitly admitted” in recent weeks there are concerns over potential missed diagnosis in its screening programme.Prof Ann O’Doherty, national clinical director of the programme, told an Oireachtas committee last month that she had received 15 solicitors’ letters within two weeks over legal issues, when she would normally only get one a year. She said she feared spiralling legal costs could lead to the screening service being shut down.Mr O’Carroll, who represents a number of concerned women who have contacted BreastCheck seeking their records, said any settlements would come from the State Claims Agency and not from a cancer screening programme. “It may well be that some of the 24 cases involving confidentiality clauses relate to BreastCheck.“They should come out now and start notifying the women where they have knowledge of significant delay in diagnosis and treatment.”Mr O’Carroll added that it would be “immoral” not to inform women and families where there was such knowledge.Appearing before an Oireachtas committee on finance, public expenditure and reform, Mr Breen said “up to when we started to espouse open disclosure as the proper thing to do, there were probably occasions where confidentiality clauses were put into settlements”.“Without going back over inidual cases, I am guessing that, of the 8,500 clinical cases we have resolved, no more than a dozen and a half or perhaps two dozen were in that category over all those years.”Mr Breen said the period he was referring to was from 2002 onwards.The cervical cancer scandal was exposed when Ms Phelan, who is terminally ill, refused to sign a confidentiality clause as part of a €2.5 million High Court settlement with US-based Clinical Pathology Laboratories, which missed her cervical cancer during a 2011 smear test carried out by CervicalCheck.Ms Phelan (43) was diagnosed with cancer three years later and a 2014 audit showing her original smear test to be inaccurate was withheld from her by CervicalCheck until September 2017.She refused to sign a gagging clause so as to allow other affected women to be told.Mr Breen said the State Claims Agency had opposed the use of a confidentiality clause in Ms Phelan’s case.Asked for a response yesterday afternoon, a spokeswoman for the HSE said it would need more time to consider the issues raised so as it could answer in a meaningful way."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550890.1530521358!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin businesses call for safer cycling infrastructure in city","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin businesses are coming together to demand safer cycling infrastructure in the city centre for their staff. Photograph: Nick BradshawDublin businesses are coming together to demand safer cycling infrastructure in the city centre for their staff. More than 40 companies have teamed up with the Dublin Chamber of Commerce to call for increased Government spending on segregated cycle lanes and better bike facilities in the capital. The companies include Arthur Cox, Mason Hayes \u0026amp Curran, Sam’s Bar, the Dawson Hotel, Ervia, Griffith College, DIT and Horizon Blue Talent Consulting. Graeme McQueen, Dublin Chamber’s head of public affairs said companies are seeing a sharp increase in the amount of staff commuting to work by bike. “They are becoming increasingly aware of the need for better, safer cycling facilities in the city,” Mr McQueen said. “Since 2008, the number of people commuting into the city has doubled to more than 12,000 every day. However, for the most part, this progress does not come as a result of good cycling infrastructure, but rather in spite of it. This needs to change.” Mr McQueen said feedback to the Chamber indicates thousands more would like to cycle but are too afraid to get on their bikes.“The need for a proper cycling plan in Dublin is clear. Such plans have been central to cycling becoming so popular in cities in Denmark and the Netherlands,” Mr McQueen added. “Currently, around 6 per cent of work commutes in Dublin are made by bike. In Copenhagen, that number exceeds 40 per cent.” Dublin Chamber of Commerce is due to send a letter to the Minister for Transport Shane Ross highlighting the need for the Greater Dublin Area Cycle Network Plan, which was launched in 2013, to be implemented. Stephen McManus, co-founder of CyclingWorks campaign said “people who commute to work by bike are happier, healthier, more likely to arrive on time and less likely to take sick days”. “Companies are increasingly aware of these benefits and also realise that the cost of providing parking spaces can be prohibitive. So it makes sense that companies are now eager to see their employees being provided with a safer commute which can be provided through increases investment in infrastructure.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550847.1530514505!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"bono pays tribute to varadkar and coveney at new york concert","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tU2 on stage at Madison Square Garden in New York.

About 150 ambassadors attended the gig on the eve of the Government’s event that will kickstart a two-year campaign to try to win the Security Council seat for the 2021-22 term.“We are proud of the island of Ireland,” Bono told the crowd on the band’s second-last date of the US leg of their Experience \u0026amp Innocence tour.“They work very hard to protect our borderless island,” he added, referring to Mr Varadkar and Mr Coveney. “Are we up for a borderless island here?” he asked the crowd, to shouts of no. The U2 singer also paid tribute to former Irish president Mary Robinson who was also in attendance at the concert for her work in the Northern Irish peace process. Mrs Robinson with Bono will help the Taoiseach and Tánaiste launch the campaign on Monday. The Government hopes the high-profile support will help the campaign to take one of the 10 non-permanent seats on the security council, the most powerful body at the UN, over competition from Norway and Canada. Speaking on stage last night, Bono applauded the UN’s peacekeeping work saying that the world has “watched those blue hats put themselves in harm’s way all over the world.”“Tonight we have 150 ambassadors representing the United Nations here tonight we want to thank you for keeping the world more peaceful,” he said. “You do f**k up the traffic here sometimes but that’s okay,” he added, referring to the notorious traffic congestion caused during the UN General Assembly every September.In a call to action, he urged more women and young people to get involved in campaigns, pointing to demonstrations in the US at the Trump administration’s separation of immigrant children from parents at the border with Mexico. There needed to be “less of people like - less older white guys,” he joked.“Seriously though we have got to ersify, we have got to open up. That’s why if the United Nations did not exist, we would have to invent it because it is the one thing that puts peace on our table,” he said, before introducing the band’s song, One. Mr Coveney, speaking earlier to reporters, said the campaign with a “big bang tonight” with the hosting of UN ambassadors by U2 at the concert. “This is really the top table of world decision-making,” the Tánaiste said of the council. He acknowledged that the council’s failure to act in the conflicts in Syria and Yemen showed the body needed to be reformed. “If Ireland isn’t part of that discussion, then we can’t influence it,” he said. Mr Varadkar told a press conference that the Government wanted a seat on the council because it believed in “working together through international organisations to solve some of the world’s problems.”He was not able to provide a figure on how much the campaign would cost but most of the work would be done by politicians and diplomats over the course of the work they would be doing anyway."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550909.1530523673!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"katherine zappone backs president higgins for a second term","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tKatherine Zappone: supports Mr Higgins, who will announce his future next week.

It will not be the last if the current Government has its way Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Monday formally launches the Irish campaign for a seat for 2021-2022.The challenge Ryan faced that Sunday afternoon in the residence of the Irish “perm rep” on Manhattan’s Upper East Side 17 years ago is typical of the tasks that come with membership.Article 51 of the UN charter requires any member state that attacks another to report to the presidency of the council and yet Powell’s call was to Annan, not Ryan, as the council’s president.He interpreted this as possibly President George W Bush but certainly vice president Dick Cheney, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and fellow hawkish “neocons” choosing not to become “entangled” with the council and particularly two permanent members, China and Russia, who were certain to object.Fearful of the potential civilian casualties heading into the Afghan winter, Ryan wanted the US to engage with the council in order to set up a co-ordinated UN humanitarian response.“We have a job here,” Ryan said he told Annan. “We have to bring them into the council but obviously we are going to have an uphill battle.”Ryan later made his case to John Negroponte, the US ambassador to the UN.“If you don’t take this suggestion seriously, you will be attacked for the famine and all the humanitarian disaster that will be happening and you will not be able to do anything about it because you will be in there on strictly military terms,” Ryan told Negroponte, according to the Irish man’s account.A flurry of phone calls later, after missiles began flying in Afghanistan, Negroponte called Ryan to tell him: “I think Irish diplomacy is beginning to work.” At that, Ryan lined up a call by then minister for foreign affairs Brian Cowen to Powell.The article 51 letters setting out the justification for the action subsequently landed on Ryan’s desk. The US was in. Ryan recognised US diplomats were “putting their heads into the lion’s den, totally against the advice of Cheney and Rumsfeld”.In retrospect, he believes the episode created “a template for the future”. Ryan said Annan told him that he believed “no other country” could have persuaded the Bush administration to engage with the UN but Ireland.Coming to the table saying Ireland had no agenda was key, said Ryan. “Everything was transparent, everything was clear,” he said. “We weren’t upsetting anybody but the system was already working before troops met each other in the field in Afghanistan.”Ireland’s membership of the council – the third occasion since 1961 that the Irish have held a seat, each falling roughly at 20-year intervals – was dominated too by responses to the civil war in Angola and the creation of a new country, East Timor. It put Irish diplomats in the front line of international relations.Critics question the cost and effort required from years of lobbying, including the endless meetings, wining and dining for Ireland in foreign countries, to win the temporary seat.An Irish diplomat once joked there were “no crustaceans left on the sea bed” after the culinary hospitality showered on foreign envoys during the campaign to win a seat 20 years ago.Wesley Boyd, the former  diplomatic correspondent, described the campaign to win a security council seat last year as “an expensive vanity trip”.Brian Cowen, minister at the Department of Foreign Affairs the last time Ireland held the council, rejects the view it is a “bookkeeping exercise” carrying a cost for the Irish purse.“What we derive from this and the standing it brings is not to be underestimated,” he said. “There is a value there that is not on the balance sheet but that is there in terms of the respect for the country and its ability to participate and work to solve problems well beyond our own shores.”Frank Smyth, director of the UN policy unit at the Department of Foreign Affairs, worked at the UN the last time Ireland was on the council. He says membership not just allowed Ireland to develop a higher profile with all 192 other UN member states but helped strengthen bilateral relations with the five permanent council members – the UK, the US, France, China and Russia – at political and official levels.“For many countries, the UN is the forum where they are most likely to see Ireland and form an impression of us,” he said. “By acting fairly throughout our term and by handling the heavy council agenda with competence, Ireland left a legacy which enhanced our national standing more broadly.”Cowen says the experience of serving on the council over the past four decades has allowed successive generations of Irish diplomats to develop skills to operate at the highest level.“It is not simply a question of prestige, although it is a prestigious thing,” he said. “The sort of training and experience it gives our diplomats on the front line of international politics is of huge benefit in the longer term to the department in how it serves the country and the network it builds up.”Ryan says the Irish voice is “particularly listened to” at the UN, and Irish diplomats carved out a reputation of speaking carefully, in a considered way and of being effective, fast-moving and transparent.“We are a small country with a big eye, small but broad-shouldered. We are not afraid to approach difficult delegations and countries.”The 15-member United Nations Security Council is one of the six main organs of the UN and is primarily responsible for maintaining international peace and security.It is the most powerful body in the UN system. Unlike other UN organs, only the council has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to implement.There are five permanent members of the council: China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Ten non-permanent members are elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms.RussiaSoviet Union has used its veto powers the most out of the five permanent members of the council. It has used its veto 12 times to shield the government of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria, a key ally of the Kremlin, since the country’s civil war began in 2011.The US has begun using its veto again under Donald Trump’s presidency in support of Israel. The British and French have not used their veto powers for almost 30 years.If elected to the council, Ireland would hold the monthly presidency of the council at least once during its term as it is rotated alphabetically among the membership."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550841.1530513588!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"merkel to meet allies in last attempt to avoid rupture","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel leaves after a party leadership meeting at the CDU headquarters in Berlin. Photograph: Omer MessingerAFPGetty ImagesChancellor Angela Merkel will meet her Bavarian allies on Monday afternoon in a last attempt to find agreement on migration policy and avoid rupture in their centre-right alliance after almost seven decades.The stand-off, which threatens Dr Merkel’s fourth-term coalition, escalated on Sunday after an emotional eight-hour crisis meeting of the Christian Social Union (CSU) in Munich.Its leader Horst Seehofer, who is also interior minister in Berlin, offered to stand aside amid CSU disagreement on whether last week’s EU political proposals on asylum seekers were sufficiently strong to avoid German border closures.“I said I would make both positions available in the next three days,” Mr Seehofe said on Monday morning, ahead of final talks with the chancellor. “We want an attempt at agreement in the interests of this government.”In the CSU’s larger sister party, Dr Merkel’s own Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the resignation threats from Munich appear to have solidified support behind the chancellor.“We have done everything to build bridges and we will do everything to ensure the CDUCSU union stays together,” Mr Peter Altmaier said, federal economics minister and a close Merkel ally.But the CSU leader’s resignation threat has darkened further the mood between the two parties, who have shared a parliamentary party in the Bundestag for 69 years.From today Mr Seehofer had vowed to turn back at German borders migrants already refused asylum or registered elsewhere in the EU - unless Dr Merkel could convince European leaders to sign up to “equivalent” measures to reduce asylum numbers.The chancellor returned from last week’s all-night summit agreement convinced she had a deal to appease the CSU, but her hopes of ending her coalition crisis evaporated in a long weekend of closed-door meetings and megaphone diplomacy.“The situation is serious, everyone knows that,” Dr Merkel said in a German television interview on Sunday evening.She repeated a concern of EU leaders that unilateral measures could endanger the Schengen free-travel area and warned her Bavarian allies against “uncoordinated, unilateral measures in Europe at the expense of” other member states.“Europe works slowly,” she said. “I am in favour of Europe remaining together.”Acknowledging her political career hung in the balance, Dr Merkel reportedly told political allies a CSU refusal to accept last week’s summit conclusion would mean “I don’t need to show my face again in Europe”. After an all-night marathon, EU leaders reached political agreement on Friday to step up controls on the EU outer border and bring migrants to central processing camps inside and outside the EU.In addition, Berlin struck bilateral agreements with Greece, Spain and a reported dozen others to send back from Germany asylum seekers already registered there.After conciliatory signals on Friday senior CSU officials said on Sunday that, on closer inspection, the agreement was filled with “contradictory small steps”.The CDU and CSU sister parties have wrestled on Dr Merkel’s liberal refugee policy since Germany accepted over 1.4 million people in 2015 and 2016.Germany has tightened up its asylum procedures since then and new arrivals have fallen dramatically. But political observers suggest the CSU is looking for a symbolic tightening of border rules to salvage its law-and-order profile, and endangered absolute majority, when Bavarians choose a new state parliament in October.If Mr Seehofer - or a successor - goes against Dr Merkel’s wishes she is likely to fire him, triggering a walkout of CSU ministers in the Berlin and a likely rupture of the CDUCSU parliamentary party alliance and Dr Merkel’s coalition.Asked if she would discipline her rebellious coalition partner with a Bundestag confidence motion, Dr Merkel replied: “We’ll see.”On Sunday evening, Dr Merkel appeared to concede her response to the refugee crisis had given a political boost to the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).“Perhaps there is sometimes a yearning for simple answers,” she said,” and that without Merkel there would be no migration problem.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550851.1530515670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"downing street produces third brexit customs model report","story":"Downing Street has produced a third model for handling for post-Brexit customs ahead of crucial Cabinet talks on Friday, according to reports.British prime minister Theresa May will bring together her Cabinet at Chequers on Friday to thrash out details of a white paper setting out the UK’s plans for areas such as trade.Brexiteers oppose the Ms May’s favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.Their “max fac” alternative would, rather than scrapping customs checks, uses technology to minimise the need for them.Both options have been dismissed by the EU. According to the BBC, No 10 has now produced a third model for handling customs after Brexit which will be discussed by senior ministers at the prime minister’s country residence.Prior to the report, communities secretary James Brokenshire said there was “no doubt that there is strong views on either side” over Brexit in Cabinet, but insisted he was “confident” Ms May’s top team could reach an agreement at the meeting.Mr Brokenshire said the UK government was planning for “all eventualities”.Meanwhile, leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg has said Ms May must deliver the Brexit she promised or risk collapsing the government.Mr Rees-Mogg said Ms May and her top team must decide at Chequers if they would stand by her pledges or reduce “a once-proud country” to a “tremulous state that sees Brexit as mere damage limitation”.Writing in the Daily , Mr Rees-Mogg warned Ms May she was in danger of splitting the party like Sir Robert Peel, who plunged it into the political wilderness for nearly three decades following bitter isions over trade reforms.He said: “Theresa May must stand firm for what she herself has promised.“One former Tory leader, Sir Robert Peel, decided to break his manifesto pledge and passed legislation with the majority of his party voting the other way.“This left the Conservatives out of office for 28 years.It comes as Ms May’s chief Brexit official reportedly told ministers they have no chance of striking a bespoke trade deal with Brussels. Briefing Cabinet ministers ahead of the Chequers talks, Oliver Robbins is said to have painted a bleak picture of the situation, with a source telling the Times they came out of the meeting thinking “we were even more screwed than we were before”.Business secretary Greg Clark and commons leader Andrea Leadsom both refused to rule out an extension to transition arrangements in the face of demands from Tory backbenchers for the timetable to be maintained.Mr Clark said the decision must be “guided by the facts and the evidence” and Mrs Leadsom said December 2020 was not a “magical date”.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3550368.1530470887!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk s business secretary holds out prospect of longer brexit transition","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSecretary of State for Business Greg Clark. Photograph: Will OliverEPABritain’s post-Brexit transition arrangement with the European Union could extend beyond its scheduled limit of December 2020, one of Theresa May’s most senior ministers has suggested. Business secretary Greg Clark said during a visit to the port of Dover that evidence should dictate when Britain moves away from the status quo in terms of alignment with the EU.“At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run this very successful port ... in order to make sure that we can continue the success, and that we don’t have frictions, there are things that would need to put in place,” he told Sky News.“Computer systems, for example, posts at the border, even if they checked number plates. What we need to assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice, and then it seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.”The cabinet will meet next Friday at the prime minister’s country residence at Chequers, ahead of the publication next week of a white paper outlining the future relationship Britain wants with the EU. More than 30 Eurosceptic Conservative backbenchers have written to Ms May telling her to show “courage and leadership” and to stand firm against calls to compromise with the EU.“Our departure must be absolute,” the letter states. “We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation. Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”Housing secretary James Brokenshire said on Sunday that he was confident that ministers would unite around a common position at Friday’s meeting. And Graham Brady, chairman of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers said that cabinet disunity could lead to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn becoming prime minister. “The danger of disunity at the top of the party is not just that it makes the prime minister’s job more difficult in negotiations with Brussels, and therefore puts at risk the good Brexit deal that is in reach,” Mr Brady wrote in the Observer. “It also gives an impression of ision to the country. Electorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for ided parties. They rejected decisively the ided Tory party in 1997. If we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.”Mr Corbyn is under pressure from anti-Brexit groups in his party to back calls for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, as a poll showed most members of the Unite union wanted a second vote. Members of Momentum, the grass-roots group that backs Mr Corbyn’s leadership, have also called for a fresh referendum but the Labour leader on Sunday resisted the demand.“We have not proposed it, we have not supported it and we are not proposing it now,” he told Sky News.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

He was the first to concede defeatRicardo Anaya, from the conservative PAN, conceded 45 minutes later, saying he had already phoned the winner to wish him well.I recognised his triumph, I congratulated him, and I wished him success, the 39-year-old said.Once his victory became clear supporters streamed towards the Zocalo plaza at the heart of Mexico City, cheering and chanting: It is an honour, to be with Obrador.The plaza was completely full by the time he arrived to give a victory speech in which he underlined his long-time claim that he would head the biggest transformation of Mexico since the 1910 revolution - though he also stressed three times that the transition would be both peaceful and ordered.Nothing to create an economic crisis, he pledged, vowing to respect the independence of the central bank, keep taxation at its current level, and promote business.I will not let you down, he said, to wild cheers from the crowd. We are going to be ruled by three basic principals. No lying, no stealing, and no betrayal of the people. Thousands of supporters of Mr Lopez Obrador crammed into the Zocalo square in Mexico CityA thousand miles to the north, in the border city of Ciudad Juarez – from where he launched his campaign in April - cars were honking their horns as they passed his party’s headquarters, and drivers sped by waving flags, leaning out of their cars and cheering.The long-time friend of Jeremy Corbyn has been the front runner from the start, but has made an extra effort to win over the sceptical northern states. Making his third attempt at taking the presidency, he promised to defeat “the mafia of power” and usher in a new era of corruption-free rule, in which the most marginalised come first.His platform includes promises to sell the presidential jet, slash his presidential salary in two, and turn the presidential palace into a cultural centre. He has campaigned with the pledge of doubling pensions for retirees, increasing scholarships for students, and boosting production and employment in the impoverished south.How he will pay for this remains unclear – his team speak vaguely of corruption reductions freeing up millions of dollars.And he has been remarkably unspecific in his plan for dealing with Mr Trump, Nafta and the surging violence – only talking about rooting out the causes of organised crime, such as poverty and a lack of opportunities among the young, and floating a plan for an amnesty for cartel members.Mr Lopez Obrador in Ciudad Juarez on April 1, to kick off his campaignNevertheless, his message has resonated in a country exhausted by endless corruption scandals and a failure to reduce the incessant violence. As the results were announced in Ciudad Juarez two policemen were shot and injured not far from the headquarters, in another grim sign of the deteriorating security situation which both the PAN and the PRI have failed to calm, and which has driven the city to support Mr Lopez Obrador for the first time.May has been the worst month for murders in the city in seven years, and, dependent on trade with the US, the election has set residents on edge.Mr Lopez Obrador’s candidate for mayor of the city, Javier Gonzalez Mocken, who by midnight on Sunday had a narrow edge over his opponent, told The  his party was going to work on reducing the causes of cartel violence.“Lopez Obrador is looking at the reasons – the poverty and lack of hope,” he said, inside the chaotic party headquarters as the votes came in. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, casting his vote on Sunday morningHe admitted he did not agree the suggested amnesty for cartel members.“In the strict sense of the word, no, I’d not be in favour of that,” he said. “Not if they have killed people. But he’s talking about how lots of people are driving into working for the gangs through lack of opportunity. He talks about scholarships, and universities. That is good for the city.”And he said he was confident Mr Lopez Obrador would establish a working relationship with Mr Trump.He\u0027s a very serious man, he said. Both sides want a deal on Nafta, as businessmen in the US and Mexico are concerned by this uncertainty.We\u0027ve definitely been taken aback by the treatment from Mr Trump - it\u0027s been worse than any other president. We\u0027re concerned by him. So we have elected Mr Lopez Obrador to improve our relations with the US.Mr Pena Nieto addressed the nation on state television, promising to work with Mr Lopez Obrador for a smooth transition.Mr Lopez Obrador will take over on December 1.Please review our commenting policyUK must boost military spending or risk losing special relationship, says US secretary of defenceMoorland wildfires started by arsonists will take \u0026#39many days of sweat and effort\u0026#39 to extinguishUK weather: Thunderstorms bring pause to heatwave as Britain to bask in another scorching weekPhilippine mayor on Rodrigo Duterte\u0026#39s \u0026#39narco-list\u0026#39 slain by \u0026#39sniper\u0026#39 during flag-raising ceremony Poldark, series 4 episode 4, review: heartbreak and intrigue sees Poldark return to formArchway attack: Boys arrested over teen stabbing with kitchen knife in north LondonAngela Merkel on brink as interior minister Seehofer says he will resign over migrant dealCheryl Tweedy and Liam Payne announce split: Couple reveal \u0026#39tough decision\u0026#39 to \u0026#39go separate ways\u0026#39Jacob Rees-Mogg: Theresa May must keep her Brexit customs union promise or risk revolt by Tory MPsArtificial human ovaries created for first time in major breakthrough for infertile womenLeading piano competitions ban teachers from jury over rigging fearsJapan\u0026#39s yakuza gangs face crackdown as they cash in on .... sea cucumbersKim Jong-un \u0026#39blasts workers at factories for not working hard enough\u0026#39The 8 things you might have missed this weekendComment: Why ban skirts when schools could simply make every uniform option available to all?North Korea expands weapons facilities despite US pressure to disarmIstanbul gay pride march hit with tear gas as Turkish police try to enforce banPrince Charles lends favourite family portraits for birthday exhibitionCouples paying £60,000 for surrogates despite UK system of \u0026#39reasonable expenses\u0026#39 onlyWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg  width= 2500  height= 1875  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/12/24/16/voted-leave-getty.jpg","title":"brexit two years deal uk economy effects city london ashoka mody international monetary fund","story":"Created with Sketch.The message of the Brexit vote - and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since - was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitmentsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBrexit is a done deal - but the social and economic wounds that led to it have not been healedAt the two-year anniversary of the Brexit vote, officials are engaged in fractious debate on the terms of Britain’s exit from the European Union.They are wrestling with several thorny problems, including the fate of the customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.But the political and media focus on the deal to be struck has obscured the real message of British voters. The vote for Brexit was a cry for greater opportunity from those who feel that they and their children are mired in lives that offer little hope. \u0026nbspBrexit is a done deal, and the exact parameters of exit from the European Union will have limited and short-term bearing on the UK’s economic performance.The basic facts are uncontroversial. Britain will trade somewhat less than before, at least until British businesses redirect some of their trade away from the EU to more dynamic Asian and US economies.The expected decline in the extent of international trade will, for a while, reduce Britain’s overall economic welfare. But, as the Harvard economist Dani Rodrik has repeatedly emphasized, citizens’ economic welfare changes only modestly when countries with extensive trade relationships increase or decrease the extent of their international trade.Estimates of large (sometimes very large) costs of Brexit rely on the wildly unreasonable assumption that British productivity will decline precipitously and permanently.True, the UK\u0026nbsphas been growing slower than other advanced economies since the Brexit vote but that slower growth is almost entirely explained by senseless fiscal austerity being pursued by Prime Minister Theresa May’s government while other countries have neutral or even expansionary fiscal policy.There has been much handwringing about the depreciation of the pound triggered by the Brexit vote. Currency depreciation normally makes citizens poorer: they pay more for foreign products and receive reduced prices for their exports. But the UK was running a large (and growing) current account deficit.Put simply, the UK was not richer it was living beyond its means. Prolonged current account deficits would eventually have caused a sharper and, therefore, potentially more disruptive exchange rate depreciation. For now, the depreciation has helped narrow the deficit (precisely by making British exports less expensive for trading partners – stimulating demand for British goods – and making imports dearer for British consumers). Britain is on a more sustainable growth path.Moreover, as I noted at the time, the pound’s depreciation reflected an abrupt decline in “hot money flows” into the UK\u0026nbspThese foreign funds were being used by Russian oligarchs and Indian billionaires to bid up prices of property in London. After the Brexit decision, the rate of rise in London property price increases slowed markedly recently prices have actually dropped.Since the modest trade costs of Brexit are at least partially offset by favourable developments, it is crucial to recognise what is really at stake. The Brexit vote expressed the anxiety of those who felt that their prospects of rising up the income ladder were vanishing. In her October 2016 address to the Tory party conference in Birmingham, Theresa May seemed to understand that the vote was a plea for greater opportunity and fairness. But she seems to have lost track of that insight.As my student Rachel Lurie and I find in ongoing research, those who voted against Brexit were predominantly low-skilled workers stuck in dead-end jobs or unemployed in Britain’s rust-belt areas. As former Prime Minister Gordon Brown wrote in the days after the Brexit referendum, unable to face Asian competition, British manufacturing “collapsed,” and industrial towns “hollowed out,” leaving semi-skilled workers “on the wrong side of globalisation.”But rust-belt parents had a deeper reason to worry. They were bequeathing poor education and work opportunities to their children. Thus, not only were they themselves stuck, they also felt powerless to create more opportunities for their children and grandchildren.The children, for their part, are as dispirited as their parents. Commentators commonly point out that young British citizens voted more so than their elders to remain in the EU. This ignores the large numbers who did not vote: these were young citizens typically unemployed in socially dysfunctional urban communities.For example, in Greater London, the voter turnout was 79 percent in affluent Kingston upon Thames borough but only 65 percent in Hackney, where large pockets of deep poverty and alienation persist. The non-vote of the young living in bleak urban areas was as much a sign of hopelessness as the exit vote of older rust-belt citizens.Theresa May’s early reading was right: UK\u0026nbspcitizens were indeed pleading through their vote (and non-vote) for a fair shot at the future. They were urgently calling on British leaders to revitalize decaying industrial areas and bring hope to failing urban communities in which they were trapped.The message of the Brexit vote – and of similar protest votes in other western democracies since – was that if citizens do not feel economically secure at home, they will reject international commitments.That crucial message has been lost amid the frenzied Brexit negotiations. Until it is heard, it will continue to haunt, and be repeated again and again.Ashoka Mody\u0026nbspis Visiting Professor of International Economic Policy at Princeton University and former deputy director of the International Monetary Fund’s European and Research Departments.

Just two companies –\u0026nbspBP and Shell –\u0026nbspaccounted for £1 in every £7 of all UK listed companies’ net debts.Both were forced to restructure after oil prices collapsed in 2015, taking on more debt, in part to maintain idend payments despite low profits.The consumer goods sector borrows more than any other in the UK, accounting for almost a quarter of UK plc\u0026nbspnet debts with three-quarters of that debt accounted for by just two companies: tobacco giants Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco.“It seems we may now have seen peak indebtedness,” said Justin Cooper,\u0026nbspchief executive of Link. However, investors should not be worried that listed companies are in trouble, he said.There was cause for concern two years ago as gearing levels –\u0026nbspthe ratio of a company’s debt to its equity capital –\u0026nbspapproached those seen just before the credit crunch. At the time companies’ profits were relatively low.“Now, healthy global growth means higher profits,” Cooper said. “That has both brought gearing levels down, and means that interest costs and idends are much more comfortably covered by profits. What’s more, companies are less dependent on short-term borrowings than at any time in the last 10\u0026nbspyears.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It analyses how well the ‘self-improving school-led system’ (SISS) policy agenda, which was brought in in 2010 by the coalition\u0026nbspgovernment\u0026nbsphas worked, and the implications it has had on schools. The research also surveyed almost 700 school leaders, looked at 10 years of Ofsted results and analysed how well Multi-Academy-Trusts worked.\u0026nbspReport authors Professor Toby Greany and Dr Rob Higham found the system had become less equitable, with higher achieving schools accepting fewer pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds than before.The report states: “The schools judged Good and Outstanding between 2010 and 2015 saw a relative reduction in the percentage of students eligible for free school meals (FSMs) compared to the 2005–10 period, while schools judged Satisfactory, Requires Improvement and Inadequate saw a relative increase. Schools that retained an Outstanding grade between 2010 and 2015 saw a greater relative reduction in FSM pupils compared to schools that were Outstanding in 2010 but that had been downgraded by 2015.”UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

In MATs, a central board of governors manages the running of all school within the group.The report found some school chose to voluntarily join local MATs that they felt were a better fit for their school, for fear of being forced to join national MATs, which they thought might narrow their curriculum.\u0026nbspSchools isolating children in \u0027consequences booths\u0027, ministers warnedNew GCSEs could \u0027shut state school pupils out of top universities\u0027\u0027Thousands of students missing from schools before taking GCSEs\u0027“And thanks to our reforms schools that aren’t delivering for young people are being turned around, with 65 per cent of schools made into a sponsored academy seeing improvement from inadequate to good or outstanding.“But there is always more to do, which is why we are investing £23 billion by 2020 to create more good school places and we are targeting £72 million at the areas that need it most to help improve prospects and opportunities for some of the most disadvantaged young people.”The study was funded by the Nuffield Foundation and Education Development Trust.Department for EducationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that.

Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening

The franchise would then be run by a state-controlled “operator of last resort” company staffed by civil servants.An estimated 230,000 passengers use Thameslink and Great Northern – which run from Bedford through London to Brighton, and Peterborough to Kings Cross station in London – every working day.The implementation of a new timetable had been expected to cause delays but chaos soon ensued, with cancelled trains\u0026nbspand long delays at train stations becoming routine.\u0027Extreme\u0027 heat to climb higher amid wildfires and rail disruptionRail bosses apologise to MPs over new train timetable shamblesGTR’s response further angered customers. Additional security staff were posted at stations on GTR routes to protect staff from unhappy commuters, while the rail operator appeared to blame a sole taxi company for disruption across four separate routes.Charles Horton, GTR chief executive, resigned in recognition of the company’s “very challenging times” and Mr Grayling has faced calls to step down, as MPs from across the House of Commons expressed their concern at the prolonged inability of their constituents to arrive at work on time.A spokesman for Govia Thameslink reportedly refused to comment on the reports about the possible loss of the franchises and instead chose to re-release a statement that apologised for the disruption.UK news in picturesA firefighter carries a water hose past sheep close to scorched moorland as it burns during a moorland fire at Winter Hill, near Rivington,People march in central London to mark the 70th anniversary of the NHS.People look at the damage to the outside of a high-rise block in Wellington Way, Mile End, in east London, after a fire broke-out in a 12th floor flat.Prime Minister Theresa May holds up a Belgium football shirt given to her by Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel, center left, during a round table meeting at an EU summit in Brussels.

We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?“First the UK needs to decide what it wants, then there needs to be a discussion here and even if it is acceptable, there are processes that have to take place first before everyone agrees to move forward.”Another source close to the European Commission told The Independent: “Now we are looking at December as a more likely option, but there are questions about how much time that leaves for the deal to be ratified in time before March.”There is no hope really for October now. We don’t know exactly what she is asking for yet, so how can there be?In broadcast interviews senior figures also pressed the need for urgency, with commission president Jean-Claude Juncker calling for UK negotiators to finally “make clear their positions”, and Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte saying: “I am not losing patience, but time is getting shorter and shorter to come to an agreement.”On the record Downing Street is still clear that the UK’s intention is to secure a deal as quickly as possible, with October’s summit the goal.Varadkar criticises government for not planning for Brexit before EU referendumA No 10 spokesman said when last week’s get-together concluded: “We have always been clear the Brexit is a challenging process.“But we have made good progress so far, and are publishing a white paper next month setting out clearly what our future plans will achieve.”The food and drink staples at risk of shortages due to BrexitDanny Dyer’s rant about Brexit and David Cameron in fullWhy is Jeremy Corbyn staying quiet on Brexit?What do the ‘bad boys’ of Brexit have to do with Russia and Trump? Danny Dyer’s expletive-laden tirade on David Cameron and BrexitHowever, the view taken off the record by British ministers more closely corroborates the idea that the timetable has now slipped, with senior frontbenchers signalling that October has been becoming less plausible the longer the deadlock in London continues.December is also now being seen as the moment when a deal could most plausibly be struck, something supported by the fact that the government identified 21 January 2019 as a potential staging post on the road to Brexit.A proposed amendment to Ms May’s EU withdrawal bill, which has now received royal assent, committed a minister to making a statement to parliament if that date passes without a deal.But if December is now the new deadline, it leaves the prime minister facing a race against time in the new year\u0026nbspto win parliamentary backing for any agreement before Brexit takes place on 29 March 2019.She will need to win a one-off vote backing the deal and enshrine it in a piece of legislation, which both houses of parliament may wish to amend.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchRecent fraught debates and rebellions as Ms May tried to pass her EU withdrawal act have not gone unnoticed in Brussels, where officials are nervous that the prime minister may yet fail to have the deal they agree backed by enough MPs.But first the prime minister must secure the backing of Brexiteers in her cabinet, in a crunch meeting at her official country residence that should finish with the UK being able to publish its latest Brexit white paper, setting its goals for future relations with the EU.One potential source of friction, post-Brexit immigration rules, has been neutered for now, with government sources telling The Independent that element of Ms May’s future plans is more likely to be explored in a separate paper coming closer to September – but the vexed issue of customs arrangements still needs to be agreed by her top team.The Chequers meeting was originally set up to start the previous day, with only those who sit on the cabinet’s Brexit subcommittee attending.But with that group having already failed to agree to either of Ms May’s options for customs and leaning towards a harder Brexit since the departure of the more Remain-minded ex-home secretary Amber Rudd, the Thursday meeting was scrapped.Holding a meeting of the whole cabinet could give Ms May more cover to pursue a path which would see her keep the UK in a tighter customs deal with the EU and even the single market for good.\u0026nbspBut there has been some speculation that if she goes too far, then key Brexiteers – most notably Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox – could seize the moment and resign from her cabinet, badly destabilising her whole administration.Those close to Mr Johnson, whose name comes up more than the others, have rubbished the idea. Either way, Downing Street insiders admit that Friday’s meeting could well be one that runs into the following day.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

who was forced to resign after joining forces with opposition parties to defeat his own MPs and repeal the Corn Laws.“There are some things that no independent nation could agree to,” Mr Rees-Mogg wrote, in an article for The Daily .“Any attempt by the EU to impose its laws and court on the UK, either directly or indirectly, must be rejected.“Any EU agreement that restricts the country’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters could not be accepted.”A government source said a third plan for customs arrangements had been devised, but insisted no details would be announced before the Chequers awayday.People\u0027s Vote march -

Just tired of this endless threat and counter threat.“Why don’t we want the best for the UK than for our own ideological cliques? And there are others in this negotiation as far as I’m aware?”The infighting came ahead of the prime minister facing MPs this afternoon, when she delivers a potentially perilous statement on the EU, following last week’s Brussels summit.\u0026nbspHer chief Brexit negotiator, Olly Robbins, is reported to have told ministers there will be no “bespoke” trade deal and Britain must basically pick between the Norway and Canada models.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We must not remain entangled with the EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.“Anything less will be a weakening of our democracy. Britain must stand firm.”In a sign that a longer transition period could be accepted across the political ide, those\u0026nbspcomments were earlier echoed by Jeremy Corbyn, who said he believed the transition period after Brexit would be extended.“At the moment it’s not set in stone,” he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday. “It’s talked around for two years.

Just two companies –\u0026nbspBP and Shell –\u0026nbspaccounted for £1 in every £7 of all UK listed companies’ net debts.Both were forced to restructure after oil prices collapsed in 2015, taking on more debt, in part to maintain idend payments despite low profits.The consumer goods sector borrows more than any other in the UK, accounting for almost a quarter of UK plc\u0026nbspnet debts with three-quarters of that debt accounted for by just two companies: tobacco giants Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco.“It seems we may now have seen peak indebtedness,” said Justin Cooper,\u0026nbspchief executive of Link. However, investors should not be worried that listed companies are in trouble, he said.There was cause for concern two years ago as gearing levels –\u0026nbspthe ratio of a company’s debt to its equity capital –\u0026nbspapproached those seen just before the credit crunch. At the time companies’ profits were relatively low.“Now, healthy global growth means higher profits,” Cooper said. “That has both brought gearing levels down, and means that interest costs and idends are much more comfortably covered by profits.

These include Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Syria and the annexation of Crimea. The poisoning of a Russian former spy in Salisbury has also heightened tensions between Moscow and the UK. Mr Bolton said in Moscow Mr Trump would raise the “full range of issues”.The biggest names involved in the Trump-Russia investigationMr Manafort is a Republican strategist and former Trump campaign manager. He resigned from that post over questions about his extensive lobbying overseas, including in Ukraine where he represented pro-Russian interests.Mr Gates joined the Trump team in spring 2016, and served as a top aide until he left to work at the Republican National Committee after the departure of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.George Papadopoulos was a former foreign policy adviser for the Trump campaign, having joined around March 2016.The President\u0027s eldest son met with a Russian lawyer - Natalia Veselnitskaya - on 9 June 2016 at Trump Tower in New York. He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard opposition research in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump\u0027s son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House. He met with a Russian banker appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Mr Kushner has said he did so in his role as an adviser to Mr Trump while the bank says he did so as a private developer.Former tabloid journalist and now music publicist Rob Goldstone is a contact of the Trump family through the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow. In June 2016, he wrote to Donald Trump Jr offering a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had information about Hillary Clinton. Mr Goldstone was the intermediary for Russian pop star Emin Agalaraov and his father, real estate magnate Aras, who played a role in putting on the 2013 pageant. In an email chain released by Mr Trump Jr, Mr Goldstone seemed to indicate Russian government\u0027s support of Donald Trump\u0027s campaign. 717 Aras and Emin Agalarov Aras Agalarov (R) is a wealthy Moscow-based real estate magnate and son Emin (L) is a pop star. Both played a role in putting on the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. They allegedly had information about Hillary Clinton and offered that information to the Trump campaign through a lawyer with whom they had worked with, Natalia Veselnitskaya, and music publicist Rob Goldstone.

He said in an initial statement that the meeting was about Russia halting adoptions of its children by US citizens. Then, he said it was regarding the Magnitsky Act, a US law blacklisting Russian human rights abusers. In a final statement, Mr Trump Jr released a chain of emails that revealed he took the meeting in hopes of getting information Ms Veselnitskaya had about Hillary Clinton\u0027s alleged financial ties to Russia. He and the President called it standard opposition research in the course of campaigning and that no information came from the meeting. The meeting was set up by an intermediary, Rob Goldstone. Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort were also at the same meeting. Mr Kushner is President Donald Trump\u0027s son-in-law and a key adviser to the White House. He met with a Russian banker appointed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in December. Mr Kushner has said he did so in his role as an adviser to Mr Trump while the bank says he did so as a private developer.Former tabloid journalist and now music publicist Rob Goldstone is a contact of the Trump family through the previously Trump-owned 2013 Miss Universe pageant, which took place in Moscow. In June 2016, he wrote to Donald Trump Jr offering a meeting with a Russian lawyer, Natalya Veselnitskaya, who had information about Hillary Clinton. Mr Goldstone was the intermediary for Russian pop star Emin Agalaraov and his father, real estate magnate Aras, who played a role in putting on the 2013 pageant.

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

Heres the latest.Water companies have the power to impose restrictions on how households can use water in times of serious shortage.Temporary bans can make it illegal for householders to water gardens or wash the car with a hosepipe.They can also ban people from filling swimming pools, ponds and fountains from the mains supply, and cleaning windows, paths and decking with a hose.Gardeners can still water the plants with a watering can.Utility firms are given the powers under the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which extended previous laws.They can limit any or all of the activities, all the time or at set times of the day, for as long as they think necessary.Anyone found guilty of breaking a ban can be prosecuted in a criminal court and fined up to £1,000.Water companies are meant to cut the following years bills by a reasonable amount to compensate for the limited supply during any ban.While there is not a country-wide hosepipe ban, one has been activated in Northern Ireland - coming into effect at 6pm on Friday, June 29.NI Water chief executive Sara Venning said: We have maximised our water production and need customers help to reduce demand.We are asking customers to take heed of the hosepipe ban and stop non-essential water use - using hoses and sprinklers is causing demand to exceed the capacity to supply.Some water companies have already asked customers to cut back on their use although have stopped short of an official ban.On June 28, Southern Water asked people to spend no longer than four minutes in the shower.The firm warned: With temperatures rising and a heatwave sweeping across the UK, we are hitting peak demand for water.Water is a precious resource and its important that we all do what we can to reduce wastage, come rain or shine.This can include simple measures such as turning off taps when youre brushing your teeth, swapping a bath for a four-minute shower and watering your garden with harvested rain.This can make a huge difference to water supply levels across the region.On June 30 both Severn Trent Water in the Midlands and United Utilities in the north west also asked people not to use hosepipes and sprinklers.Severn Trent said: Were set for another hot weekend, and, with demand for water really high, were producing millions of extra litres.Were asking customers to be careful with their water and for now avoid using the garden sprinkler or hosepipe.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That was exactly what the meeting had been about, and everybody there knew it.The summit was Operation Save Mutti. Their mission: To stop Merkel’s government collapsing by thrashing out a tough stance on immigration to calm her critics. It’s quite a turnaround.Once, Merkel, with her open-door refugee policy, was queen of Europe. Now she’s a beggar. Suddenly, European politics has changed beyond recognition.The tide has turned. Those making the case for an open Europe are haunted and chastised. They are losing elections.Italy’s new coalition of left and right-wing populists is a fiesta of political contradictions, but they share one goal: To stop the migration population from growing.They want a European refugee policy that is pretty similar to what Austria is advocating.Sebastian Kurz, Austria’s young and energetic Chancellor, has begun to talk about “an axis of the willing” between his country, Italy and Germany.He has canvassed allies in Germany for his ideas on migration reform.Many in Merkel’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) are tired of her and her centrist style of leadership and see Kurz as their hero.Earlier this month he staged a press conference with Horst Seehofer, Merkel’s interior minister, coalition partner and chairman of the Christian Social Union (CSU) party.Seehofer now wants Germany to turn away migrants who do not have documents or who first applied for asylum in another EU country. Merkel has refused. If the decades-old CDU-CSU alliance ends over this issue, Merkel’s government would collapse.Until recently, it was assumed that Merkel would last until the next elections in three years’ time.Now many are betting she won’t even make it through the summer.There are two kinds of European solidarity now: The Merkel type and the Kurz type.To survive, Merkel must find a way to reconcile the two, but she is perhaps the only leader in Europe who thinks that is still possible.Countries to the north, south and east of Germany have already moved away from her refugee vision.Denmark and Sweden reinstated border controls in 2015.Viktor Orban, in Hungary, and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, in Poland — often dismissed as loonies and fruitcakes — feel that their views on immigration have been vindicated, not just at home but across Europe. And why shouldn’t they?Much as their migration policies are flawed, they are winning the battle of ideas over border controls and openness.They have many new allies in European capitals. Slovakia and the Czech Republic now have leaders who complain about Muslim immigration.And yes, Emmanuel Macron’s victory was astonishing — but a third of France still voted for right-winger Marine Le Pen.Merkel’s view of Europe was the consensus. When Macron took power, it was hoped Europe would be purged of grubby thoughts about migrants.Merkel’s case for a common European policy on refugees seemed likely to win.But the elections in Italy and Austria changed all that. Having populists in former Soviet bloc states is one thing. Having them running Western European states is quite another.The balance of power keeps changing, shifting ever further from Merkel.The incoming Slovenian PM, Janez Jansa, is a migration hardliner and, like others in the Balkan region, sees Europe’s political future as being represented by Budapest rather than Berlin.So what to do? Merkel now stands as the charity case, not the powerbroker.Macron offers her some respite, saying he will help her by taking back the few asylum seekers in Germany who registered first in France.But far more refugees will have registered first in Italy, and the odds on its new government taking them are slim. In Austria, Kurz is focusing on a plan to force refugees to apply for asylum before they enter the EU.When Austria assumes the EU’s rotating presidency next month, Kurz will make this a centrepiece of his agenda. Kurz’s stance is unacceptable to Merkel. Belgium and the Netherlands are also protesting because they fear that forcing migrants to apply from overseas centres will lead to inhumane migration detention camps, as seen in Australia.But can Merkel fight against it?If she wants to stay in power she will need to be wary of those in her own CDU ranks who are closer to Seehofer.If her leadership recently took them to their worst election results since 1949, what might await them after more years of Merkel in power?Whatever she now chooses to do will cause her reputation to crumble.If she fires Seehofer, it may be the end of the German centre-right as the party in charge.If she goes along with Austrian and Italian demands to turn back migrants, she will be admitting that her open-door policy on migration killed her own vision of a welcoming Europe.She has run out of good options, as well as political authority. She may limp on in Germany for a few more years, but her long reign in Europe has ended.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Since then Johnny has seen his life spiral out of control.He admits to struggling with drugs and depression and he’s lost much of his £459million fortune.He’s embroiled in court battles over money and was pictured recently looking incredibly thin and pale.When I interviewed him at the end of last year he was clearly “well refreshed” and virtually incoherent.Maybe having to face up to his child’s health problems could actually be a turning point for Johnny.His family need him right now and he will have to step up to the mark. ONE of the feel-good ­stories of the week was the kind students who raised enough money to send Bristol University cleaner Herman Gordon to visit his family in Jamaica.Herman was beside himself with happiness and cried tears of joy when he opened his gift envelope to find it stuffed with cash for the trip.He’s clearly a very ­special man and much loved by the students, who said he brightened their lives and they simply wanted to give him ­something in return.Herman was part of the Windrush generation and can’t afford to go back to Jamaica too often.But now he and his wife can have a wonderful visit.This little shaft of light gives me hope for the future and shows there is still a lot of decency in the world.Herman also now knows that he makes a real difference and is greatly valued – and you cannot put a price on that. A HUGE thank you to everyone at Edinburgh Napier University, which presented me with an honorary arts doctorate this week.It was so moving to see all the young, hard-working students come up on stage at the Usher Hall to receive their degrees in front of beaming parents, family and friends.Two years ago I saw my daughter Rosie awarded her honours degree in journalism on the very same stage.I was so proud of her I could have burst.It was lovely to be able to follow in her footsteps and it really was a day to remember.  DESPITE not having watched a frame of Love Island, I’m obviously well aware of the show that has divided the nation.But what really strikes me is how similar they all look in the promos and newspaper photos.It’s no wonder the girls bounce from one chap to another when they are merely identical hairless Ken dolls.The same goes for most of the girls. The hair colour and bikinis might be a different hue, but they have that heavily browned, slightly startled, puffy-mouthed look of a sex doll.Which I suppose is the point.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Last October, this column urged Mrs May to get the Cabinet to Chequers and not let them leave until they had agreed on the final deal with the EU they should be aiming for.This delay in setting out what the UK wants is one of the many mistakes that have handed the initiative in these negotiations to the EU.In an attempt to prevent any walkouts at Chequers, the Prime Minister will spend the next few days seeing senior ministers individually. “She’s peeling off people one by one,” I’m told.But I understand there has still not yet been a “model that has been selected to go forward for adjudication by the Cabinet”. I am told the approach at the meeting will be “to rule things out rather than rule things in”.Cabinet Brexiteers, though, are already nervous about getting bounced — of being presented with a done deal they will have to either accept or resign over.One of those co-ordinating the Brexiteer response tells me: “She’ll have to show her hand before Chequers. The idea of bouncing people with papers they haven’t seen is completely unrealistic as to where we are.It might have been possible six months ago, it is not possible now.”Brexiteers are worried about Downing Street’s direction of travel.One tells me: “They’re prepared to give away things, but they don’t understand what they are giving away.”The expectation is that the Government will essentially propose staying in the single market for goods.But what won’t be addressed is what this means for immigration.The EU will — at least initially — demand free movement in exchange for the UK staying in the single market for goods.I understand the current plan is for the white paper to say the UK acknowledges that labour mobility deals normally go alongside trade deals. But there won’t be much more detail than that.Sajid Javid, the new Home Secretary, takes the view that the Government shouldn’t put immigration on the table in these talks until it knows what it wants.He is also of the view that if the EU want a deal on immigration then they should have to ask for it.As a former banker, with experience of commercial negotiations, he — unlike too many people in the Government machine — understands the difference between bid and offer.Among Cabinet ministers there is a growing view that they will all be back at Chequers in September to discuss how much they are prepared to move on immigration.But any attempt to get the UK to allow any EU citizen with a job to come here will encounter resistance.“If you can come if you have a job, that’s basically free movement,” one ally of Brexit Secretary David Davis tells me.Getting the Cabinet to agree at Chequers, though, is only the first challenge for Mrs May.The next — and even more difficult one — is to get the EU to engage with what she is proposing. CONCERNS are mounting in Whitehall about the Nato summit, and what Donald Trump might say and do.Compounding the issue is that Trump will go straight from the summit to a dinner in Britain to mark the start of his visit here – meaning Theresa May won’t be able to avoid having to say what she thinks of his comments.One well-placed Government source insists to me that the Trump/May relationship is better than it is portrayed.But this source admits his telephone manner can be rather surprising.I am told that, in reference to Brexit, he regularly starts their conversations with: “Are you out yet?Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake. That the West’s security has relied on Nato for 70 years.And that it would be a disaster for the President to undermine it now, with Russia an increasing global menace.THE restoration work at the House of Commons has hit a snag.Some of the oil paintings, which need to be moved, are too big to go through the doors of the rooms they are in.This means that the oil will need to be rehydrated, a complex process, before the canvases are rolled up so they can be moved.This is another reminder of how difficult it will be to do these restoration works without going way over budget. MICHAEL GOVE has ripped up Theresa May’s plan for a new customs partnership with the EU.To the surprise of officials present, Gove tore the document in two at a meeting on Wednesday.After the Brexit inner Cabinet couldn’t reach a consensus on what customs relationship to have with the EU after Brexit, it was split into working groups to look at the two options.Gove was looking at the new customs partnership, which is Theresa May’s preferred model and would see the UK collecting tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Nearly all Brexiteers, including Gove, see this model as bureaucratic, unworkable and fear it will make Britain a far less attractive country to do a trade deal with.Gove and Liam Fox, the two Brexiteers on the three-man working group, had made these points repeatedly in the six weeks of meetings they have had on the subject.But on Wednesday night, when they were presented with the civil service summary of their discussions, they found these points had been downplayed to almost nothing.Instead, the document implied the group thought the new customs partnership was workable.Gove was livid about this and physically ripped it up to show he wasn’t prepared to accept the document as a summary of their discussions.This flash of anger shows that Downing Street would be making a very big mistake if it assumed Gove will accept – and sell to fellow Brexiteers – any deal with the EU, no matter how flawed it is and how much it tied the UK’s hands for the future.Customs will be one of the biggest bones of contention at Chequers.I understand there is talk the model favoured by Brexiteers MaxFax might be altered to include tariff alignment with the EU.But if that’s the case, then Britain WON’T be able to have a proper, independent trade policy.One of the Brexiteers close to the discussions warns this is the “breaking point of what people are prepared to accept”. THERESA MAY is making it clear to everyone in government that she intends to stay on as Prime Minister after Brexit day, March 30, 2019.Yesterday afternoon, Downing Street summoned the Government’s political advisers and told them to start working on measures to be included in the next Queen’s Speech, to take place in spring and after Brexit day.A Downing Street source tells me: “As you would expect, the Government is focusing on a comprehensive programme of domestic legislation for the next session of Parliament.This will include new plans for the country’s future outside the European Union.”This Queen’s Speech will be huge for Mrs May.It will be her last best chance to show her party she has a domestic agenda that justifies her staying on as Prime Minister.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

To which the EU’s Michel Barnier will inevitably reply: “No. It’s full single market membership, including free movement of migrants, or nothing.”Then what? What else has No10 got?There are red lines Theresa May must not cross: free movement, independent trade deals, our courts’ supremacy. She won’t survive conceding on any of them.We weep for Downing Street’s tactics.They seem ­terrified that the PM might have to walk out of talks. Why? If the EU continues to demand everything on its terms, she must do exactly that.They’ll call back.GOBBY Irish PM Leo Varadkar has no idea how much damage he does with every Brexit utterance.His latest salvo revealed a patronising, pompous arrogance as misplaced as it was sickening.The mighty EU won’t change its rules for little Britain, Varadkar sneered.“We’re 27 member states — the UK is one country,” he said. “We’re 500million people, the UK is 60million. That basic fact has to be understood.”The Sun has some more basic facts:Ireland’s population is 4.8million. The UK’s is 66.5million.Ireland’s economy relies on us so heavily that a “no deal” is forecast to throw 2.5 per cent of its workforce on the dole. It is far more exposed than any other EU country, or the UK.Our billions bailed out broke Ireland in 2010. Has Varadkar forgotten?Is he happy to sour relations with millions of UK customers with long memories, who may take against Irish goods?A wiser man would have acted as peacemaker, constructively helping both sides forge a historic deal in all our interests, including those of his country and its wonderful people.Instead he chose another role . . . as the snivelling suck-up egging on the playground bullies.THERESA May must seize her crucial opportunity to save Nato next month.Donald Trump is rightly berating Europe’s major powers for failing, unlike Britain, to fund their defence. But Nato is not some unfavourable trade deal he can abandon at a stroke.Mrs May hosts his UK visit on July 13, right after he’s laid the law down at the Nato summit and before he flies out to meet Vladimir Putin. She must stress that lives are at stake.

They must also achieve an outcome which allows the UK to take back full control over our laws, our borders and our money.Any wavering or compromise that keeps Britain as a cash cow for Europe, and our people and businesses subjugated to EU laws that hurt our interests, would be a spectacular own goal.Instead of pandering to those who want to keep Britain in the EU, the Single Market and Customs Union, the team at Chequers must now stand firm and not back down.Their strategy and game plan must be to stand up to the EU and stop letting their negotiating team walk all over us.So far we have been negotiating with the EU in good faith and we have conceded too much ground for little in return.We have pledged a divorce settlement totalling £40billion and while we have advanced a package to ensure that the rights of EU citizens currently in the UK are protected, the rest of the EU have made alarmingly little progress on protecting the rights of British citizens living elsewhere in the EU.Conceding further ground to the EU now will leave Britain exposed at the back and will let the greedy undemocratic EU leaders take advantage of our open goal.The country also decided to take Britain on a new path to future prosperity.Outside of the EU the world is growing at a fast pace.Expanding consumer markets present new opportunities for exciting trade and investment partnerships. Technological change and innovation happens worldwide and the EU’s place in the global economy is falling fast.Ministers must not allow Britain to slip in the world trade league by being chained in any way to Brussels as the EU sinks.Without the straitjacket of EU rules Britain will stand out as a strong place for businesses to invest.While an out-of-touch elite who want to keep Britain in the EU continue to spread fear and doom and gloom, in the real world our economy is doing well.We have some great foundations and since the referendum Britain has seen a surge in foreign direct investment to record levels which shows the high degree of confidence investors have in Britain.They see that outside of the EU Britain will be successful and everyone in the Cabinet should stop playing defensively and commit to that vision too.We are at a crucial moment in our history and Cabinet members need to understand the magnitude of the decisions   they are making.Now is not the time for grandstanding or for egos to get in the way. Ministers need to tighten ranks and play as a united team to achieve victory.The future of our country is far too important to leave to chance and if the Cabinet gets its act together this week then we will be in control of our own destiny.In years to come, people will look back at the decisions we make today and judge members of this Government on whether they have advanced the cause of freedom, prosperity and democracy with a well-executed match- winning plan . . . or left our country to the fate and uncertainty of a penalty shoot-out.Priti Patel is a Conservative MP, representing  Witham in Essex. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Way better, in fact, without wanting to sling mud, than many other commentators who — regardless of their gender — can barely string two words together.Because, of course, whether or not you are good at your job has got absolutely nothing to do with your gender, right?Until, that is, you are a woman in football, or some other realm that men consider belongs to them.Then, it turns out, it’s a problem. For some men at least.Just to be clear, the idea that football is a “guy thing” is totally outdated. More women watch football in the UK than watch EastEnders (and that’s when there isn’t a World Cup on).And that’s just watching it. I’ll get on to playing it in a minute.Still, Simon Kelner, the former editor of the Independent, wrote in a column this week that women talking about World Cup games “is like getting a netball player to discuss major league basketball”.Then former player Jason Cundy gave his five cents worth, saying that women are unsuited to commentate on football matches because “their voices are too high”.And — although I had to watch it from behind a cushion because I was cringing so much — former Manchester United defender Patrice Evra gave Eni Aluko an actual round of applause for her analysis of one match. . . because he was so surprised that women, you know, know stuff about football too.(Her face when he did so was priceless: Withering look personified.)In case you didn’t know, Eni Aluko has more than 100 caps for England as a player. She also has a first-class degree in law. She is super brainy, bright and articulate — and she knows an awful lot about football.I am full of admiration for her. She is such a strong woman. She is also more than qualified to comment on a football match.Sadly, “more than qualified” is often what women need to be to get ahead in a male world.Eni Aluko is a high-powered lawyer, a professional sportswoman who adds serious value to the commentary of any match.Patrice Evra must know her credentials. But some men, when they feel threatened by a woman, respond by patronising her. They try to put her down. Diminish her. Banish her back into her box.As a woman working in sport I am familiar with this.Lots of men who think women in football are encroaching on “their” territory do the same to me. The number of suggestions I’ve had to get back in the kitchen — and far worse — are too many to count.It doesn’t bother me. But it is tedious and annoying.Men who respond to women in this way can’t quite accept that a new generation of women are coming to the fore and using their voice.They really can’t get their heads around the changes that are happening so quickly — the emergence of women who are using their voice, taking “their” jobs.Luckily, they are a dying breed, these men who want to keep women in the Victorian ages.Plus, it is beginning to dawn on them that we aren’t going back into the box.And they’d better get used to it because it’s not just women commentating on football who are being taken more seriously. It’s women who are playing it too.I’m proud and excited to say that West Ham is one of 11 clubs with new Women’s Super League licences.This really is going to change the face of women’s football.Tier one, the Women’s Super League, starts next year and West Ham is part of that.And the Super League is going to mean a lot more money, professionalism and structure for women in football.So to anyone who is worried about female match commentators all I can say is: Hold on to your hats, boys.REBEKAH Vardy got slammed this week for speaking out about being in Russia.She said that she took the role of supporting her husband – and being there for him before a match – very seriously, saying: “I would be mortified if I was pictured leaving a bar absolutely p***ed, knowing that my husband was going to play one of the biggest games of his life the next day.”Of course, some wasted no time laying into Rebekah’s version of feminism since it included being present for her husband which – according to comments I read – undermines feminist values.I have to say I really disagree.Whoever said that you can’t be a feminist and also stand by your man?I LOVED reading about Christine Lampard, who is pregnant, saying she, “couldn’t care less” about putting on weight as long as everything’s OK inside.In an age when many pregnant women barely look like they are expecting, only to “snap back into shape” within days of giving birth, that’s such a refreshing attitude. I felt the same way and allowed myself to eat what I wanted.I know some women crave chalk and coal when they are pregnant but my craving was for Wagon Wheels.At one point I was on about 12 a day. Those were the days.JOOLS Oliver says that being a stay-at-home mum is ten times harder than Jamie’s job running a multi-million-pound cooking empire.She described her role as “brain numbing” and “hell on earth” and said no one respects her in the household. I’m sure lots of eyes will roll at that idea, but I have to say that I agree.The brief run-in I had with being a stay-at-home mum left me full of nothing but admiration and respect for those women who do it on a daily basis.And it made going back to work feel like a walk in the park.LET’S congratulate New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, for being only the second woman ever to give birth while in such senior office.Some people have questioned whether Jacinda can do the job as a new parent. Would that same question ever be asked of a man?WELL this is exciting. Scientists are apparently closer than ever to inventing an invisibility cloak.I’m sure it’s intended for use by top secret agents intent on saving the world.But all I can think about is what a great accessory it would be for any party at which there are people you don’t fancy talking to.Or for eavesdropping on Apprentice candidates.Or spying on the half-time huddle of any team West Ham is playing.In fact, the possibilities are endless.HONESTLY there is no pleasing some people. The number of moans I have heard this week about people who think it is too hot.Just cast your mind back to the past couple of years when it rained solidly for most of June and July – and count your lucky stars.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

which is unprecedented in its bluntness - has been leaked to The Sun.In it, former US Marine Corps general Jim Mattis says Washington DC is “concerned” that Britain’s military prowess is “at risk of erosion”.With threats around the world spiralling, America now expects the UK to hike its cash to the military to help counter them “beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests”.In an ominous threat, the general also makes it very clear that while Britain may want to “remain the US partner of choice”, France is already boosting its defence spending - and is waiting in the wings to replace us.President Trump wants an answer from the UK by the time he arrives in Europe next week for the NATO Summit, Mattis adds.The letter’s revelation today is a deep embarrassment to Theresa May, and plunges her into a fresh political crisis.Defence Secretary Mr Williamson, backbench MPs and British generals have all pleaded with her to hike the MoD’s budget and fill its £20bn blackhole.But the PM is adamantly refusing, alongside Chancellor Philip Hammond.The letter from highly respected General Mattis - nicknamed “Mad Dog” when he was in the Marines -  was sent on June 12, three days after he held talks in London with Mr Williamson while his guest at Trooping the Colour.In the two page letter, General Mattis argues that Britain’s position as a leading world power “has been the credibility of the UK’s armed forces”.But he adds: “I am concerned that your ability to continue to provide this critical military foundation for diplomatic success is at risk of erosion, while together we face a world awash with change”.For the first time in the letter, the senior US politician also gives a firm hint that Washington now wants Britain to go beyond  the NATO minimum of spending 2% of GDP on defence, which the government only just about meets at the moment with the inclusion of pensions.Mattis adds: “A global nation like the UK, with interests and commitments around the world, will require a level of defense (sic) spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests.“Absent a vibrant military arm, world peace and stability would be at further risk”.Purposely highlighting Paris’s recent pledge to pump an extra £260bn into bolstering its armed forces by 2025, Mattis adds: “As global actors, France and the US have concluded that now is the time to significantly increase our investment in defense.“Other allies are following suit.”And dropping the hint that the Special Relationship is now in peril with France in ther wings, Mattis goes on: “It is in the best interest of both our nations for the UK to remain the US partner of choice.“In that spirit, the UK will need to invest and maintain robust military capability.“It is not for me to tell you how to prioritize your domestic spending priorities, but I hope the UK will soon be able to share with us a clear, and fully funded, forward defense blueprint that will allow me to plan our own future engagement with you from a position of strength and confidence.“In advance of that, the President and I look forward to hearing details of the progress you have made with your Modernizing Defence Programme at the upcoming NATO Summit.”Generals are calling on Mrs May to increase the MoD’s budget to 2.5% of GDP a year, which would see a cash increase of £6bn-£7bn.In comparison, the US spends 3.6% of the biggest GDP in the world on its military.But Mrs May has infuriated Tory backbenchers by repeatedly refusing to commit to maintaining the UK’s status as a Tier One military power, saying only that the UK would be a “leading nation” instead.Former Chief of Defence Staff Lord Houghton warned on Saturday: “US observers have come to realise we are living a lie.“President Trump is not remotely impressed by our national pretension to be America’s greatest ally.”The letter will also be seen as more evidence that Mrs May’s relationship with Donald Trump is under increasing strain.Fears are mounting in Downing Street that the President will use next week’s NATO summit in Brussels to announce a major US drawdown unless more members states step up their military funding.The letter – leaked to The Sun by military sources – has been copied to the Chiefs of the three armed forces, as well as No10, and National Security Advisor Sir Mark Sedwill.Senior Tories last night called on Mrs May to urgently act on  Mr Mattis’s warning.Former  defence minister Mark Francois MP told The Sun: “For many months, the Defence Committee has been arguing that we must increase our defence spending, not least to remain a credible ally of the Unietd States.“This letter is a real wake up call that we need to invest to maintain our leardership in NATO, and I hope the Prime Minsiter takes urgent note.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It involves another woman having a baby for couples who are unable to conceive, carry to full term or give birth for any reason.The law says courts should only sign over parental rights if surrogates have received no more than reasonable expenses. It is supposed to stop people profiting from the practice and protect wannabe parents who may be vulnerable to exploitation.But charity Surrogacy UK says judges are allowing larger payments if they are convinced it is in the “best interests of the child”. Natalie Smith, from the charity, told a fertility conference in Barcelona that surrogacy in the UK typically costs £6,000 to £12,000.This includes compensation to the surrogate for time off work and maternity wear, medical bills, legal fees and travel expenses. But a study by the University of Kent found four in ten couples spend more than £15,000, with some paying up to £60,000.It is not known how much of this is going on legitimate costs and how much is being pocketed by the surrogates as extras. Natalie, 37, who had twins using a surrogate, added: “If someone pays more than reasonable expenses the judge does have some flexibility. I think that’s important because the welfare of the child must trump everything, even though I feel very strongly about not supporting commercial payments.”Norman Wells, from the Family Education Trust, said: “It is difficult to see how the commercialisation of reproduction can ever be in the best interests of the child.“It is adults who control the market and therefore it will always be adults who stand to gain from it.“Whenever reproduction is removed from the natural order, it is inevitable that some people will try to cash in on it and children will be seen as commodities and a means to the end of making a small fortune.” Surrogacy contracts are not legally enforceable in the UK and the surrogate is the legal mum until a court issues a parental order.There were only 55 parental order applications in England in 2007 but this had rocketed to 316 by 2016.The Department of Health says the increase reflects “the broadening diversity of families, with more LGTBQ+ couples and people with fertility difficulties turning to surrogacy”.Natalie, from London, was speaking at the annual conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

or what they coyly refer to as novel weapon technology.“And the files reveal they were desperate to capture this technology - wherever it came from - before the Russians or the Chinese got hold of it first.“Although this was 1997, Russia was still regarded as undefeated enemy with a weapons programme regarded as a threat to the West.”Alien experts claim there have been more than 100,000 recorded UFO sightings worldwide in the past 100-plus years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000276899927.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa may brexit negotiator trade deal jacob rees mogg","story":"Oliver Robbins -

A picture of the child holding hands with new husband Che Abdul Karim after their wedding widely circulated online was the catalyst for anger in the Muslim majority country. The bridegroom already has two wives and six children aged between five and 18, according to local media reports. His new bride\u0027s impoverished parents are said to have agreed to the marriage on the proviso that she lived with them until she was 16. The groom is a scrap rubber dealer who is comparatively wealthy. On Sunday he defended his actions, claiming that he had not eloped and had married her with permission of her family. I was disappointed with various criticisms and allegations made against me in the social media after I took her as my third wife, he told The Borneo Post .

UNICEF\u0027s representative in Malaysia Marianne Clark-Hattingh said: \u0027It is shocking and unacceptable and not in the best interest of the child. It is a violation of her rights. The minimum legal age for marriage in Malaysia under civil law is 18. However, girls can marry at 16 with the permission of their state\u0027s chief minister, while Islamic law sets a 16-year minimum age for girls and allows even earlier marriages with the permission of the sharia court. The Malaysian government has not record of the wedding and has launched an investigation.

However, the charity estimates that 21 per cent of women aged 20 to 24 were married as children. The most number of child brides are in South Asia.

Mr McCluskey will call for his union to back a motion at its annual policy conference in Brighton today calling for clubs and supporters to take a stand against the far right.  He fears elements of the Football Lads Alliance and groups including the English Defence League and Britain First, exploit austerity to whip up working-class anger. The Premier League has warned clubs about the FLA after some supporters were seen trying to spread anti-Muslim hate at games. The FLA flag has been banned at some grounds. The Premier League said: “We have discussed the Football Lads Alliance with the UK Football Policing Unit, and the Home Office.  These reports are very concerning.”  The FLA was set up last year as an “anti-extremist” movement but has become increasingly associated with far-right activists. Up to 10,000 joined the Alliance’s first London protest in June last year. They also held a rally in Birmingham with anti-Islam activist Anne Marie Waters as speaker. Ex-English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson has joined the FLA on a march and says the group is “football supporters coming together to oppose the Islamisation of Britain”.

Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, an ally of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, won more than 50 per cent of the vote, becoming the country\u0027s first leftist leader in decades. The 64-year-old now faces a number of challenges including frosty relations with the US over its immigration and trade policies, and problems at home including drug cartels, violence, corruption and poverty. Mr Lopez Obrador, who had told voters he would to stand up to Mr Trump, was congratulated by the US president, who said there is much to be done to benefit the neighbours.  Mr Trump, 72, tweeted: Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico! Mr Corbyn tweeted: Today brings a new beginning for M\u0026eacutexico.  Congratulations @lopezobrador. His election as President with more than 50% of the vote offers the poor and marginalised a genuine voice for the first time in Mexico\u0027s modern history. I\u0027m sure #AMLO will be a president for all Mexicans. Mr Lopez Obrador had pledged to not let Mexico become a pinata battered by the United States and he has rejected Mr Trump\u0027s plan for a border wall while criticising his policies against migrants.  He said he will maintain fiscal discipline and seek friendly relations with the US, and promised to combat poverty and improve the quality of life for Mexicans. He vowed anyone who migrates from Mexico will do so because they want to, not because they have to, under his government. Tensions with the US over migration - including a policy separating migrant children from their parents - border security and talks to revise a free trade deal had loomed over the election, Mr Trump has accused Mexico of sending criminals and rapists into the US and is almost universally disliked in Mexico.  Mr Lopez Obrador is a close ally of Mr Corbyn and his Mexican wife, Laura Alvarez. The pair have met at least twice in the last 18 months - both in Mexico and at the British Houses of Parliament. At the time, Mr Lopez Obrador said: We talked extensively about the beautiful dream of making a world government based on justice and fraternity a reality.” Mr Corbyn regularly spends his holidays in Mexico - once smuggling a bag of English cheese into the country.

Then it’s probably time to upgrade your stereo to something with more features and better performance…\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByHolly Thatcher17:29, 28 JUN 2018Updated17:13, 29 JUN 2018Advertorial\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen you think back to the family car journeys from your childhood, there’s a good chance that many of them were spent listening to the crackle and whine of a sporting event played out on an old-fashioned medium wave radio. Given how much the technology in our homes has advanced, it’s surprising how many of us are still using a last generation radio– particularly as DAB upgrades and wireless connectivity for cars are so affordable. If you think it could be time for an upgrade, here\u0027s some helpful tips for choosing a stereo, and some specific recommendations. Upgrading for sound   Depending on the age of your car, even a modest update could improve the sound. Even if your car came with a digital radio, it might even be worth upgrading to one that supports DAB+ for even better digital quality and more stations. What can your car handle?   Car stereos are usually sold in two sizes: either single or double DIN. As a rule, a double DIN stereo will be able to offer you a bigger screen. It’s far easier to create a stereo that offers built-in navigation in a double DIN socket, and with many modern stereos offering video playback when you’re stationary, it’s useful to have the extra screen size. What to look for in an upgrade   If your car stereo doesn’t have Bluetooth built in, then upgrading will give you access to the music on a Bluetooth-equipped phone. That means you\u0027ll be able to listen to music streamed from Spotify or Apple Music while you drive. Many car stereos have a 3.5mm line-in (headphone jack style), while some now offer USB ports. So even if your phone isn\u0027t Bluetooth enabled, connecting an iPhone, iPod or Android phone will allow you to play music over the USB connection and keep your phone charged at the same time. The Sony MEX-N4200BT offers all of the above and costs just \u0026pound99. There’s even a CD player here for your retro music (so the kids can say, what’s that funny silver circle?). Apple CarPlay and Android Auto   One of the greatest upgrades you can get for your car is to add support for Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Stereos that use these are designed to make your phone an important part of your entertainment system - they allow you to navigate, communicate and play music, with intelligent voice control via Bluetooth (Siri with Apple CarPlay or voice control with Android Auto). You’ll need a recent phone to use either system. CarPlay works on the iPhone 5 and newer, while you need Android Lollipop (version 5) on your phone to use Android Auto. But not all Android phones support Auto, so be sure to check before buying anything. Some stereos support both CarPlay and Android Auto while some only offer one or the other. Again, it’s wise to check before you buy - Halfords experts can help you choose the right stereo for both your car and phone. Once connected to either system, you’ll be presented with a selection of apps: Google Maps for navigation on Android or Apple Maps on an iPhone. You can also access your music and podcasts through the clear and intuitive interface. Many systems will also give you hands-free calling and voice-activated features like Siri. Touching your phone while driving is now illegal, but upgrading allows you to still use your phone while staying within the law. Being able to change songs using Siri or say “OK, Google, send a message to Mum,” is really great if you’re running late and don’t want to stop to safely use your phone.

Most drivers will be familiar with the sweltering heat that comes with climbing into your vehicle on a hot day. Sometimes you barely have time to catch your breath as you struggle to switch your Air Con onto full blast. Thankfully, the Liverpool Echo has put together a list of tips which will hopefully stop your car getting so hot in the first place. If all else fails - will be a helping hand with cooling it down.  How can I stop my car from getting so hot? It\u0027s not an easy task because, you may not have intentionally parked your car in the sun - but the earth moves, so the sun will move with it, becoming really difficult to avoid it altogether. Here\u0027s some advice from the RAC: 1) Park away from direct sunlight - the obvious solution but it might as well be said. The RAC said: Parking in the shade – perhaps under a tree or canopy – is one easy way to prevent your car heating up. If you have a garage, then use it. It will keep your car cool, clean and secure. 2) Use a windscreen sunshade - according to the RAC: A windscreen sunshade keeps the sun\u0027s rays away from your car interior – especially the touch-points, such as the steering wheel and gear lever. They are available from most car accessory shops simply tuck the shade behind the sun visors when you park the car.  3) Cover your seats - the RAC said: Most modern car cabins are black and that\u0027s bad news for keeping cool. Leather seats, in particular, can get uncomfortably hot and sticky – and may degrade and crack if regularly exposed to heat. Fitting light-coloured seat covers is one solution, or you could opt for lighter upholstery in the first place. As a temporary measure, a towel spread over the seat will help keep you cool. 4) Wipe down hot surfaces - the RAC states: On very hot days, the interior door handles, steering wheel, gear lever and handbrake may become painfully hot to touch. Wiping them over with a damp cloth will remedy this. 5) Keep the air-con maintained - it said: Keeping the air conditioning system maintained is vital for cooling your car quickly and effectively. The refrigerant gas will usually become depleted over time and belts may need tightening or replacing. Consult your car handbook and stick to the service schedule.  How can I cool down a hot car? If you\u0027ve not had chance to implement any of the above, then this is a good question - and the RAC has five suggestions to help with this: 1) Fan the interior - it said: Open both the windows on one side of the car, then \u0027fan\u0027 the interior by swinging a door on the opposite side back and forth. Providing you\u0027re not worried about potentially looking a bit weird, repeat this open-close motion at least three times to help expel the hot air. Leave the sunroof shut if the car is parked outside in sunlight, though. 2) Switch on the air conditioning, correctly - the emphasis being on the word correctly, there. The RAC said: Captain state-the-obvious has arrived, but just in case you didn\u0027t already know... Start the engine and switch the air conditioning to its coldest setting. If your car offers the option, select the \u0027external\u0027 air setting (the symbol on the switch usually shows an arrow entering the car), rather than air recirculation (a circular arrow). The air outside the car will be cooler at this point. Open all remaining windows, as the air-con system will take a few minutes to become effective.

The heatwave is no fun for anyone, but there are a few things you can do to at least cool down your home. There\u0027s nothing worse than trying to nod off in your room, or trying to relax, while feeling like you\u0027re in the seventh circle of hell. Being in the midst of a heatwave is not as fun as it first sounds, especially without air con, but there are some things you can do to cool down your home and finally get some shut eye. Before we get to how to use a freezer to your advantage (not sticking your head in it) and getting as low as you can (no this isn\u0027t limbo), we have to acknowledge the quickest way is to get air con. Of course, the bad thing about getting air con is the cost - upfront and then running it - so here are a few quick tips and tricks to drop your home\u0027s temperature without spending too much.  Keep away from the satin and silk and opt for the cooler linen and cotton sheets. Light-coloured bed linen made of light fabrics (take Egyptian cotton for example) are breathable so better to sleep in. The Egyptians had it right, in fact, they even had their own method for keeping cool. Known as The Egyptian Method (original, we know) they\u0027d dampen a towel or sheet in cool water and use it as a blanket. It may be a good idea to lay the damp sheet on top of a towel first, no one likes a wet bed. 2. Freezer tricks Speaking of sheets, you can stick them in the freezer for a few minutes before you\u0027re about to go to sleep. No, we haven\u0027t lost our minds, just make sure you put them in something like a plastic bag before you pop them in. You don\u0027t want your sheets smelling of pizza and ice cream. The trick won\u0027t last all night but it will give you a breather so you can get to sleep. 3. Don\u0027t cook a roast  ...or any hot meal. Summer is never the time to be whipping up a casserole or hot meal. Put the slow cooker away, step away from the stove and have a salad. 4. Use that hot water bottle Buy yourself a hot water bottle. While we\u0027re used to filling them with hot water in the winter to keep toasty, in the summer sticking it in the freezer instead creates a lovely ice pack. 5. Turn your fan around Fans are great in the mild heat, but when it\u0027s cranked up they just blow hot air around so it\u0027s all about strategic placement. If you point them outside, slightly towards the windows, they push out the hot air. If you have a ceiling fan set them counter-clockwise to pull the hot air away. 6. Ice fan  We\u0027ve already mentioned fans, but there\u0027s so much more to be said. At school we used to use those little iceboxes to keep our food cool, so this idea comes from that. It\u0027s sort of a DIY aircon system. Use a roasting pan, or box and fill it with ice and put it in front of a fan. When the ice melts the breeze from the fan picks up the cool air coming from the ice\u0027s surface, creating a nice cool mist. 7. Cross breeze More of the fan tricks. Strategically place numerous fans around a room. Put a fan by the window, and then another further inside the room so they both push the cooler air around the room. 8. How low can you go Hot air rises so sleeping in a room on the ground floor means you\u0027ll feel cooler. If you\u0027re in a one-storey flat you can move your sheet to the ground to make life easier. 9. Don\u0027t get steamy  We imagine you\u0027re continually hopping in the shower to cool down, just make sure the water is tepid rather than warm/hot. Steam hangs about and makes a room that much hotter. 10. No lights This should make sense. Light bulbs - even if they\u0027re environmentally friendly - give off heat, so switch them off. The sun shines for longer now anyway so keeping the lights off not only saves on your energy bill, but cuts down on the extra heat. 11. Hang a wet sheet Yes, you read that right. Hanging a wet sheet in front of an open window will help bring down the room\u0027s temperature. 12. No electronic devices  The same applies here as the lights. Unplug your phone and devices, do not charge them when you are asleep. Everything radiates heat and you don\u0027t need that when you\u0027re trying to catch some zzzs. 13. Use grains Buckwheat pillows don\u0027t absorb heat like cotton does so getting one is a good investment for summer. 14. Closing curtains  In the daytime. If you think about when the sun is at its hottest those rays are coming through the window hotting everything up. Close the curtains and your room is instantly cooler.  15. Use your garden  If you plant the right trees and shrubs around the house they will provide you with much needed shade. Vines work well too. Of course that won\u0027t work for this summer, but next year you\u0027ll be thanking us. 16. Paint it white  Again, maybe one for next year, but painting your house white helps. The white colour reflects the light, cooling the house down. 17. Insulate  Long-term thinking again. When you think of insulation you probably think of keeping warm, but it can work the other way too. Good insulation keeps the heat out as well once the room is cooled down.

The young man was pulled out of the River Derwent on Saturday, it emerged last night - the latest in a succession of deaths during the UK heatwave. Emergency services were called to the area, known locally as Pebble Peach, to help three men in the water. A man who was pulled out by specialist water-rescue crews was later pronounced dead.  Police do not believe the death to be suspicious and issued a warning about the dangers of swimming in open water, Derbyshire Live reports .   Inspector Richard Price, of Derbyshire Police , said: “This was a tragic sequence of events that led to the death of a young man.   “My plea to the public is to stay out of open water in order to remain safe as the hot weather continues.  At least seven people have died in water during a week which saw temperatures soar as Britain experienced a heatwave .  On Sunday, the body of a Lithuanian man in his 20s was pulled out of a lake near Peterborough after going missing the previous day. The young man had reportedly been on a day out with his family at Crown Lakes yesterday when he got into difficulties.   On Monday, a woman drowned while swimming in the sea off Eastbourne on the south coast and the body of a man was recovered from Mercers Lake in Nutfield, Redhill, Surrey.   The same day, 13-year-old Ryan Evans went missing while swimming with two friends at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent.  The alarm was raised at about 5pm, after a witness spotted three boys in distress. The other two boys, aged 12 and 13, managed to get to safety, but Ryan was declared missing.  Following a painstaking joint emergency services effort involving police divers, sonar and sniffer dogs , the operation concluded on Wednesday evening when the boy\u0027s body was recovered from the water.    On Tuesday the body of a 17-year-old boy was pulled from the river after he got into difficulty in the River Aire in Leeds.   Then on Thursday a 20-year-old man drowned in a reservoir, despite a desperate rescue by passersby, the Manchester Evening News reports.  The man was taken to hospital from Audenshaw Reservoir in Greater Manchester, but was later declared dead. A body was also pulled from the River Thames at arund 6am this morning near Iffley Lock, Oxfordshire - but police are treating the death as unexplained. Thames Valley Police rushed to the scene along with Oxfordshire Fire and Rescue Service and South Central Ambulance Service and recovered a man from the river.

Ben Gibbs, 40, grabbed the six-year-old girl from the water and rushed her to the side of the pool as shocked swimmers watched on in horror. The girl - who has not been named - was rushed to hospital after suffering what police described as a medical episode. Dad-of-five Ben was in the water at Windsor Leisure Centre with his daughter Carin Ryall, 21, and one-year-old grandson Finley when he noticed the young girl lying under the water - and not moving. Carin, from High Wycombe, said the pool was really busy when they got there with her mum Annabell and sister Olivia, at around lunchtime today. She told MirrorOnline: We had only been there five to 10 minutes and I was about to go down the water slide with my son when I saw the girl under the water.  A first I thought \u0027she\u0027s just playing under the water\u0027 but I said to my dad about it and within that time we noticed she hadn\u0027t come up or was kicking her legs. My dad rushed over at that point and picked her up. Her body was floppy and I couldn\u0027t see her face as her head just flopped forwards. Ben added: I grabbed the girl by the arm and pulled her out the water. Her lips were blue and her eyes were open. I rushed through the water and carried her up the ladder in my arms before placing her on the side .  Carin said: The lifeguards then evacuated the pool and performed CPR on the girl as everyone stood on the side in complete silence and watched. We were all just hoping she was going to be ok. They got her her breathing but then she fell unconscious again before the paramedics got there and got her breathing again. Police told us she was only six years old. Carin said the little girl\u0027s mum was really upset after the incident and police hailed her dad a hero. But Ben said: I don\u0027t really feel like a hero - I\u0027m just glad she\u0027s ok. To be honest the tears have only just stopped - even though I know it all ended up OK I just keep thinking what if that was my daughter under the water.

Hindu Kaye-Kisambira, 27, gave birth to two identical girls and two boys, called Asma, Hana, Ahmed and Ayub. Lawyer Hindu carried the babies to 32 weeks, and had to have twice-weekly scans to monitor her little ones. She had a complicated pregnancy because the girls were not equally sharing their placenta – leaving one girl receiving a reduced blood flow. But they were all delivered safely by Dr Asma Khalil and a team of more than 30 medics, on June 21.  The foursome were the first set of quads to be born at St George’s Hospital in Tooting, London, in 13 years. Quadruplets are incredibly rare, and only two such births recorded in England and Wales in 2014, three in 2015 and five in 2016. Hindu, from Cobham, Surrey, who already has a two year old son called Haris with her husband Farouk Kisambira, said: “I was so nervous but also really excited. I knew I was in the best hands with Asma. “I can never thank her enough. It was so lovely to see her reaction when I told her that I’d named the first born baby girl, Asma, after her!” During Hindu’s pregnancy, the identical twin girls were not sharing the placenta equally, known as ‘selective fetal growth restriction’. This meant that one of the girls had reduced blood flow through the umbilical cord, meaning she was smaller than the other twin.  Hindu, was transferred to St George’s for specialist multiple birth care from her local hospital at 24 weeks. The identical twin girls were born first, weighing 1.21kg and 1.55kg, followed by the boys, weighing 1.54kg and 1.70kg. Dr Khalil, consultant obstetrician and multiple pregnancy service lead, said: “It was a great achievement to be able to carry on with the pregnancy until 32 weeks despite the complication, which is above the average gestational age for this type of pregnancy. “This is really important as the risk of prematurity, and the associated risk of disability, in multiple pregnancy is increased. “Quadruplets are incredibly rare, so we were all very excited.

Sally Osman, Royal Director of Communications, would be the latest senior figure to leave her post following the resignation of the Queen’s top aide Sir Christopher Geidt, who claimed he was a victim of a power struggle last year. In the past Ms Osman, 57, has led communications for a number of media companies including Sky, Sony and the BBC. She was brought in Clarence House as Communications Secretary for the Prince of Wales in 2013 on a six-figure salary. The departure, revealed by The Mail On Sunday , comes following a series of PR storms for the Royal Family around the marriage of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle.  Speaking to the , Ms Osman refused to comment on her position. She said: We do not comment on speculative diary stories. Any announcement about any staff movements are made in the appropriate way at the proper time. There is no suggestion that the reported departure has anything to do with the recent controversy related to Mr Markle. Yesterday, claims emerged the Duchess of Sussex hasn’t spoken to her father Thomas since his controversial interview with Good Morning Britain in which he revealed Prince Harry’s political views. The 73-year-old, who was handed a \u0026pound7,500 appearance fee, said the Royal was ‘open to Brexit’ and ‘wants people to give Trump a chance.’ He also discussed how his daughter told him she wished to have kids. Mr Markle also made headlines shortly before the wedding when footage emerged of him staging paparazzi shots which were then reportedly sold for \u0026pound100,000. The US former TV lighting director then announced he would not be walking his 36-year-old daughter down the aisle because of his precarious heart conditions.  The breakdown in communications comes a week after Mr Markle took a dig at the Queen over her meeting with US President Donald Trump when he arrives in Britain in a fortnight. He told TMZ on Tuesday: “If the Queen is willing to meet our arrogant and insensitive president she has no excuse not to meet me, I\u0027m nowhere near as bad. Meghan released a poignant statement after news broke her dad wouldn’t attend the wedding. She said: Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.  I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. “Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday, she added.

But how does it all work behind the scenes and what\u0027s it like to work for the fast food giant?       Having digested countless Big Macs over the years, reporter Sam Jones tried his hand working at the 24-hour restaurant in Skelton, Teesside.    From taking orders at the drive thru, to frying chips and cooking quarter pounders. Sam takes us through his two hours in uniform....      My guide for the first stint in the kitchen was crew trainer Dan Mortimer, a young man who has aspergers - a form of autism - but says McDonald’s has been great for him and given him confidence. He told me the clear workflow means he can follow everything efficiently and his condition means he always does everything “the right way.” After putting on my uniform for the day, the handwashing station was the first port of call. Staff have to wash their hands every 30 minutes and sign off whenever they do, which McDonald’s say is safer than wearing gloves. The first thing that strikes you in the back area is the pace of work - it’s hectic and demanding.  But a well thought out system, coupled with clever technology brings organisation to the chaos. Sophisticated screens calculate how many people are in the store and inform staff of how much food they need to have prepared, although this can be adjusted by the manager.  Watching Dan make a Big Mac at the prepping station seemed simple enough - or so I thought.  Two quick orders flashed up on the screen and it was my time to shine! Getting each section of the bun into the right toasting slot is the first challenge which, despite seeming simple enough, takes a bit of practice.  A squirt of the company’s famous Big Mac sauce follows before you grab a dash of onions, some lettuce and a couple of gherkins. A slice of cheese is next, followed by the beef, then comes the tricky bit, piecing it all together, which despite seeming like a jigsaw puzzle at first, gets easier with practice. Dan then challenged me to a competition to see who could make the best one - I’d argue mine was better, although I’m sure he’d disagree - either way, they both set off down a conveyor belt chute to be served to diners. It’s easy to forget when you collect your order what it takes to put a burger together - each one is carefully constructed and brought out nice and fresh.  Learning how to fry the fries No trip to McDonald’s is complete without the chips (I won’t get into the debate of whether you should eat them or the burger first - it’s definitely the burger first). Thankfully for me, the process of cooking them is simple enough. Their journey begins in the freezer before spending a couple of minutes in hot oil in the fryer, they’re then poured into a heated area with care taken to stock rotate and move the older ones along into another section.  A sprinkle of salt and they’re ready to go. I wasn’t quite as fast as the pros when it came to boxing them up, but Dan assured me it gets easier with practice! So much technology keeps the drive thru moving  Perhaps one of the most fascinating things about my time spent in McDonald’s was the drive thru - so much technology makes it as efficient as possible. My guide to the takeout side of the business was Jola Peters, a crew trainer who serves every customer with a smile. Have you ever wondered how your order never gets mixed up when you order at the same time as a car next to you? Well the answer is the system takes a picture of you when you order - something I was slightly alarmed to find out given some of the states I’ve looked when pulling up at the ordering point! The thinking behind it is to ensure that orders do not get confused - when customers come to the window to pay you can check you’re serving the right person.  The cash machine even does the change for you to avoid mistakes and speed up the whole process. After a couple of miserable attempts at taking orders over a headset, I left it to Jola and set about investigating how the whole system works. The drive-thru is split into three key areas which is monitored closely by a computer system - where you order, the cashier and the presenter. Working to the computer targets, staff have 30 seconds to take the order, 20 seconds to take payment and 20 seconds to present the driver with their meal. All of this is monitored on a screen which compares how the store is performing with others in the Middlesbrough area. During my time in Skelton, the restaurant was sitting in first place, closely followed by Eston. “It’s not that we are competitive, but we like to be at the top,” said store manager Louise Probert. How the operation has changed over the years  So much has changed since Louise started working for the company as a 16-year-old in Hartlepool. In her 22 years of service she’s seen the business transform: “When I started we had to use microwaves, it’s completely changed through the years. “Even the drive-thru, we used to serve at the window, now it’s through head sets. “We introduced table service and the customers absolutely love it.” Her route to management saw her climb the ladder internally before later doing a degree alongside her job. “I never went to uni,” she explained. “I did the degree programme through Mcdonald’s and I graduated in 2016 - my kids got to see it and Mcdonald’s were fantastic with it.” Flexibility  The flexibility offered to consultant Leanne Norman, who manages nine stores in the Teesside area, has been helpful after her daughter was diagnosed with autism. “I have to go to quite a lot of appointments, so I went down to four days a week and McDonald’s has been very supportive,” she said. “My parents are really proud of me making a career out of it.” The company has been a big part of Leanne’s life - who also joined aged 16. She met her husband while working there, recently won an award which meant she got the chance to travel to Florida and in the last week climbed Ben Nevis in support of Ronald McDonald House Charities. ‘I have a great amount of respect for the staff’ "},{"url":null,"title":"woman left tears car wash","story":"NewsWoman left in tears as car wash is installed right next to her fence towering over gardenAnne Parker, 79, says she used to enjoy sitting out in her garden but she says her tranquility has been shattered\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByPhilip Dewey09:03, 2 JUL 2018Updated10:14, 2 JUL 2018NewsThe car wash right outside Anne Parker\u0027s home in Pontypridd (Image: Wales Online)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has been left in tears after a car wash was installed just outside her garden.

Police are investigating whether the victims – seven women, two men and two boys aged 15 – committed suicide or were murdered at their home in Delhi, India. Nine were found hanging from an iron grill in the hall of the first floor of a three storey building with cotton and pieces of cloth over their eyes. A woman, who appeared to be in her sixties, was blindfolded and found hanging from a door frame in a room and a woman in her 80s was found dead and without blindfold on the floor of the hall.  They were found alongside several spiritual and mystical handwritten notes at the home in the Burari district. Police in the Indian capital have been left baffled by the deaths and but they confirmed they are investigating it as murder. Joint Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar said: We found handwritten notes detailing how hands and legs are to be tied and are quite similar to the manner in which the bodies of 11 persons were found. They are exhaustive notes and we are studying them.  The notes say if a group of 11 people follow these rituals, all problems would ease out and they would attain salvation. Some notes have dates on which they were written while others don\u0027t. All the notes talk about reaching the end and gaining peace. They bought sedatives and mixed it in the dinner the previous night and served it to the family. Police also found the family’s pet dog on the roof and the investigators are now trying to find fingerprint traces from its leash to deduce who killed who and also used the sedatives.

best.”Robert McConnachie’s take on ‘the mistake’ concerned the other AS, and was: “There must be two Alec Sharps, because the photo is of an Alec Sharp and the same person who worked on my house.“He was the player who had a trial at Rangers, turned up with his boots wrapped in newspaper and proceeded to disrespect Jim Baxter.“Another time, he turned up after the kick-off for a big Downfield

","title":"blether jim mclean signing john bourke just walked never to return for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJim McLean made some great signings in the early years of his tenure as manager of Dundee United.Players such as Paul Hegarty, Eamonn Bannon and Willie Pettigrew came in to the club and immediately made their mark as the Tannadice side improved year on year.This would culminate, of course, with League Cup successes, a championship title, great European runs and countless visits to Hampden on cup semi-final and final duty.However, not all of the manager’s signings worked out.One who got away, literally, was John Bourke.A cutting, dated October 3, 1978, revealed:Dundee United striker John Bourke, who walked out on the club before the start of the season, is to become a Kilmarnock player for a fee of £40,000.This is £20,000 less than United paid for him from Dumbarton a year ago last month.Bourke travelled through to Kilmarnock to meet Rugby Park manager Davie Sneddon last night.All in all, it was quite a day for the lanky 24-year-old for, only yesterday, he started a job as a PE teacher at Holy Cross Academy, Glasgow, having given up a similar post in Dumbarton when he agreed to become a full-time player at Tannadice.As far as Dundee United were concerned, it was a case of cutting their losses and accepting £20,000 less than what they paid for him.When Bourke first walked out on United, he said he would never come back to Tannadice and he intended packing up the game altogether.At that time, United were so annoyed at their player’s attitude that they would have been quite happy to see their £60,000 go right down the drain rather than see him get any benefit from his breach of contract.However, when Kilmarnock came on the scene, they made the decision to relent sufficiently to allow the deal to go through — even at a loss.In his brief spell with the Tangerines, Bourke played 28 league and cup matches and scored six times over a period where he was very unlucky with injuries, especially cuts to the face and head.After over four years at Rugby Park, in which he played around 140 games, Glasgow-born Bourke returned to Dumbarton and completed over a century of games for the Boghead side.Season 1986-87 saw him back in the local area as that season was spent with Brechin City, before he ended his senior career with another stint at Killie.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/05/59118eccdb664-e1530288290685.jpg ","title":"charity pop up shop opens today for two

development.Coldside will soon host a new community campus, alongside redeveloped housing and a proposed women’s custody unit.Some residents fear the unit – which has not yet received planning approval – could lead to a rise in crime in the area.Locals had also speculated that another secure unit for people in care was in the pipeline and were worried about the potential impact of having two units in the same place.However, their fears have been dismissed by Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership.The NHS Tayside and Dundee City Council joint body has denied that any such secure unit is planned.A spokesman told the Tele supported housing is set to be offered to a “small number of people” who are in receipt of care.Supported housing is typically included as part of a package given to someone in long-term care.That can include previously homeless people, those with mental health difficulties or substance addiction issues or those fleeing from domestic violence.The intention with such properties is to help the tenants adjust to living independently in the long term.The spokesman said: “As part of the redevelopment of Alexander Street, which has included wheelchair-adapted units, supported accommodation will be provided for a small number of people through the Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership with appropriate care packages.”The keys were handed to the first residents of new homes on Alexander Street in December following months of construction by Dundee City Council, in partnership with the Hillcrest Housing Association.A number of the properties have been built with wheelchair adaptations, following consultation with occupational therapists to ensure that the homes met the needs of those on the social housing list.Coldside

said: You don’t expect to open your door and a donkey to be there do you?“Maybe flowers or chocolates but I would never have imagined Donkey Bond would be there.“He was so cute. I had always planned to go to the farm to see him but never got round to it so it was amazing that he came to me.“People driving past must have thought I was mad having a donkey in my garden. It was just fantastic – I couldn’t have wished for anything more for my birthday.“We also went out for dinner and visited friends to celebrate but Donkey Bond was an extra special surprise.”Scott said he knew he had to do something special to mark the occasion.“I have been with Sandra for about two and a half years and I was stuck about what to get her for her 50th birthday,” he said.“I was really struggling because she couldn’t tell me anything she wanted and I knew I needed to do something big and a bit different.“My friend’s aunt owns the farm and when we found out there was a donkey being hand-reared in their house because his mother had disowned him, we just thought it was amazing and he was so cute.“Donkey Bond – who is named in honour of James Bond actor Sean Connery – has his own Facebook page and I thought, ‘I wonder if they would bring him to surprise Sandra?’.“We both absolutely love animals anyway and had been following all his social media posts so I knew Sandra would love it.“It was also the first time that Donkey Bond had ever come out for a birthday surprise like this and he was absolutely fantastic.”Scott added: “Sandra is still speaking about it now and I think she will be for the next 10 years.“It really is something for her to remember and I am really glad she liked it.“I also got her a voucher to go up to the farm and walk the alpacas which will be fabulous.“It is even better because I wanted to do it as well so I will able to go along with her.”Nicky said: “Sandra’s reaction when she opened the door was amazing – absolutely brilliant.“Scott got in contact with me because he wanted to do something different for her birthday and he knew my aunt owns Balnuith Farm.“He is a very cute donkey – he lives in the farmhouse kitchen and is toilet-trained like a dog.“There is no chance that Sandra will forget her 50th.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5aa2b6f2b9602.jpg ","title":"dundee housing service gets positive report","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA housing support service has been given a positive report by the Care Inspectorate.Gowrie Care Limited – Tayside East scored a “very good” for the quality of care and support and for quality of staffing.The service provides housing support and care at home for adults largely with a learning disability.The organisation has three centres in Arbroath, Carnoustie and Broughty Ferry where it supports people in its own centres as well as people in the outside communities.The report stated: “The service had a very good quality of care and support.“The inspector was impressed with the flexibility and compassion shown.

I like that about him.“When I knew I was moving, these things were very important to me and that’s why I came here.“The tradition of the club I know and I’ve heard good things about it as well. It should be in the top division and I want to be part of helping the team to go up.”Siegrist confirmed a chat with his team-mate at last club Vaduz, Thomas Konrad, was a big help in him making up his mind to move to Scotland.Where he does disagree with the former Dundee defender is which is the No 1 outfit in his new home city.“I’ve played alongside Thomas for the last two years, so when I did make contact here I called him and asked him about the city.“It’s always good to get some information. He has told me some nice things about the city and he was very complementary about the place.“He tried to tell me the other team was the big one, so I didn’t listen. Obviously he played for them, but it’s all good.“He told me about some derbies but I believe he got sent off in one and did well in others. That’s him.“He did tell me that everyone is football crazy here and, when I arrived in the city myself, I couldn’t believe the stadiums are literally across the road from each other.“It’s good to be in a city where football is really a big thing.”With Slovakian goalie Matej Rakovan also signing up, Siegrist’s first challenge is to claim the No 1 jersey.It’s something he’s up for and believes having two keepers battling for a place in the team will prove a good thing for both men.“You come into a new club and you have to prove yourself. You’ve got to do all you can to earn the shirt. We’ve got to make it as hard as possible for the gaffer to pick one of us.“It’s his decision at the end of the day but I will be putting everything I can into making sure I play.“Everywhere you go you have to have competition. Especially the goalie position, there is only one who can play and, in every time you go, that’s how it is.“It is good to be on your toes, it’s good to have someone pushing you either way, so it makes you train that little bit harder.“It’s a long, tough pre-season and obviously my ambition is to be the No 1 goalkeeper and that’s Matej’s ambition as well. That’s how it should be.”Whether he’s between the sticks or on the bench, his focus is already on what every United fan wants to see – the team getting promotion in the coming season.And after a week working with the new-look squad, he’s feeling optimistic about that.“The main focus of the club is promotion. The first few meetings I had with the gaffer, it’s all about getting promotion.“It’s a hard task, obviously it’s a hard league to get out of, but it’s good to be part of an ambitious club that wants to achieve something.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/AB8U9280.jpg-582x564.jpg ","title":"dundee new boy nathan ralph happy to complete switch but wanted his move sooner","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee new boy Nathan Ralph has revealed if he’d had his way he’d have been at Dens Park at the turn of the year.Back in the January window, the Tele reported the Dark Blues were keen on the left-back after being impressed by his performances at National League South outfit Woking.So, too, were several English league outfits but when he heard there could be a chance to head for the Scottish Premiership, the 25-year-old wanted to jump at it immediately.Rather than take the huff when it didn’t materialise, the former Ipswich Town kid, resolved it would happen this summer.“The thing happened in January when Dundee were interested and I said to my manager at the time, look I want to play higher,” he explained.“I don’t think at the time they were keen on me going, so I just thought if I can get a good season under my belt, hopefully, it will still be there at the end of the season. Thankfully, it was and I’m here now.”Over the past week he’s been getting to know his new team-mates in pre-season training.He’s liked what he’s seen of them and is loving the workouts under his new boss Neil McCann.“I’m enjoying it a lot. The training has been very good. Sometimes you feel you are just running and running during pre-season but, to be fair to the manager, he’s had us doing ball work straight away.“With running as well, of course, but it’s been with the ball and match specific stuff so I am really enjoying it.“You can get that hard work when you have the ball as well and it is important because, at the end of the day, we are footballers.“We need to control the ball and things when we are tired in games, so, to me, it makes perfect sense to be training this way.“And I’ve only been here a few days now but already I’ve been impressed with the players. Technically, and in terms of the morale of the squad, they are very good.”While he wouldn’t claim to be an expert on the Scottish Premiership yet, what he’s already realised is that it’s a good place to be right now.With top English Premier League boss Brendan Rodgers already at Celtic and Liverpool legend Steven Gerrard taking the reins at Rangers, he knows it’s a league that’s being noticed.“I don’t know too much about the Premiership up here yet but what I do know is that it’s a good standard and it’s something I’ve been really looking forward to being a part of.“I’m stepping up and it will be a challenge, for sure, but I don’t think I will be out of my depth and I am looking forward to playing in it.“I’ve been told it’s definitely a good time to be coming to this league. There are a lot of good players and a lot of attention with what’s happened at Rangers.“Even without that it is still a good standard and a top league and this has all the makings of a good season for me.”Fans will got their first chance of a first look at Ralph last night when Dundee’s friendly programme kicked off with the short trip up to Brechin.Having finished playing at Woking back in April, he can’t wait to get back to a game situation.“I’m very keen to get started with the games and I’m looking forward to them, that’s what I came here for.“The Betfred Cup is coming soon but I feel with the fitness work we’ve been doing and, with the friendly games coming, we will be ready for them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1f819d44b02-423x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people customer base like a little community","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChoosing what to have for lunch in a bustling city centre can be a task, however, Brodie’s Takeaway has you covered.The blue-fronted shop on Bell Street is often the go-to place to grab a whole range of tasty homemade grub and it is all thanks to Cate and Ron Brodie who opened the shop almost 14 years ago.Cate said: “We already owned Brodie’s Coffee Shop in Forfar and we wanted to branch out and open another shop.“The premises we are in were already a takeaway when we took over.”After three years of running both businesses the couple decided to sell the coffee shop and focus on their Dundee business and their two children.Cate said: “We found with running two businesses and having two kids that we were just too widespread between the shops and we decided to sell the coffee shop.“It was a really hard decision to make, but with business you have to either go really big and hire managers or stay small and in control so that is what we have done.“It has also allowed us to get our weekends back to spend with our children.”Now the takeaway is thriving with masses of hungry locals heading in five days a week for the huge range of homemade food on offer.Cate appreciates though that the shop is in an ideal location with the High School of Dundee, Abertay University and the DC Thomson offices in close proximity and full of willing customers.“We have a huge amount of regulars now from all the local businesses.“The shop is now like a meeting point with everyone like a little community and we all know each other.“I also like to introduce people to each other while they are waiting in the queues for their food.“It is a way for them to network and meet new people and it’s also great for me getting to know everyone who comes in.”Now after more than a decade the owner couldn’t imagine not having the takeaway shop.“Although it is very hard work with my days lasting easily 12 hours and starting between 5-6am, I couldn’t imagine myself not having Brodie’s.“People may think it is easy, but there is a lot of work that goes on in the background that customers don’t see.Whatever you fancy to eat Brodie’s is more than likely to have it with an extensive menu ranging from homemade soups, sandwiches and burgers to daily specials including chicken curry and stovies, there is something for everyone.But owner Cate says it wouldn’t be possible without her three employees and her 81-year-old dad, Gordon Bruce.She said: “My dad is basically on call whenever we need him.

It was my first real job in coaching and their academy was doing well but the club got relegated to the Conference and couldn’t afford to run their academy.“It’s a big outlay and, unfortunately, it folded and jobs went with it. I would have loved to have stayed, it was a great job and I had an excellent lifestyle.“The job wasn’t there so I came back up the road and there wasn’t much happening. I applied for jobs and I got close to a couple.“I ended up doing a bit of labouring and it was great, it was the best thing for me. I kept myself busy.“I was taking down cabins, near St Andrews funnily enough, and then building. I’d never had any experience of it but enjoyed it. Every day was different and the guys were brilliant. A lot of good people – I still keep in touch.“I always appreciated what I had as a footballer but sometimes you need to go out of it and get back in just to be reminded what you have.“So getting out for a bit was good, it got my appetite back without me realising I’d lost it. And just doing something different, seeing another side of life, meant I learned a lot.”His return to football came at Raith where an excellent record with the youths sparked interest from others.Determined to repay the faith Raith showed in him, he rebuffed the chance of a quick move but when United came calling he admits his affection for the place where his career started made it an offer he couldn’t refuse.“I enjoyed Raith, there were good people, a good club and it was tough to leave but I couldn’t turn this job down.“This is a big responsibility because United have produced some great players over the years. There’s a lot of good players come through and a lot of good people looked after the kids here, so there’s a lot to live up to. I was lucky to work with a lot of those people.”In recent years, the conveyor belt of young talent at Tannadice has slowed but Craig’s confident, along with assistant Scott Robertson, talent will flow.That’s in no small part because the mechanism required to produce players is still in place.“We know how important it is to keep bringing players through at this football club and there is talent here.“There is so much that goes on before us to get it to the stage where we take the players. It’s not about us, it’s about everything that goes before that to get them to the point where Scott and I take them.“Brian Grant (academy head) is on top of that and making it better all the time. It’s about us then doing the extra wee bit to take them to the first team.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"major tayside road closed in both directions after traffic collision","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA major Tayside road is closed in both directions after a traffic collision.The A9 is currently closed in both directions at the Dalguise turn off, about one mile north of Dunkeld, Perthshire.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]  if (d.getElementById(id)) return  js = d.createElement(s) js.id = id  js.src = \u0027https://connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1\u0026version=v3.0\u0027  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs)}(document, \u0027script\u0027, \u0027facebook-jssdk\u0027))A9 CURRENTLY CLOSED AT DALGUISEThe A9 is currently closed inboth directions at the Dalguise turn off, about 1 mile north of Dubkeld, due to a road traffic collision.Posted by Tayside Police Division on\u0026nbspMonday, 2 July 2018Folk are being warned to avoid the area if possible.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man convicted of driving without insurance","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJason Christie, 42, of Leng Street, was fined after admitting a motoring offence.Christie pleaded guilty to a single charge of driving a car without an insurance policy on Strathmore Avenue and on Milton Street on February 5.He was fined £300 for the offence by the justice.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b222ed15f5ad-847x564.jpg ","title":"more summer signings to come promises dundee gaffer mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNeil McCann is delighted with the five summer signings he’s made so far and the Dundee boss is determined more will follow.Monday saw Senegalese striker Jean Alassane Mendy fixed up on a two-year deal from Belgians Lokeren to join fellow-new boys Jack Hamilton, Nathan Ralph, Kharl Madianga and Elton Ngwatala in pre-season training.Neil felt it was import to get the bulk of his transfer business done as early as possible but his aim is to make more moves before the window slams shut at the end of August.“I hope to get one or two more in and we’ve always got targets,” said Neil.“This year we are a bit more advanced than we were this time last year and that’s good because I wanted to get a bit of business done immediately.“Now you go for ones who can probably be a wee bit more troublesome to get in but we are working hard on that and as the pre-season goes on maybe we’ll get a bit more business done.”To that end the gaffer has identified specific players and areas of the team where he wants to add more depth but will be giving nothing away on that until contracts have been signed.“I wouldn’t go into specific areas.

This concern has also been raised by a local member.“It is noted by one of the local members that residents of Invergowrie frequently raise concerns about the volume of traffic that uses the Main Street to avoid the Swallow roundabout in the evening peak. There is concern that the proposed scheme has the potential to cause an increase in vehicles using this route as a rat-run.“The application does not include any traffic flow modelling that could give reassurance in this regard. It is noted that drivers choose their routes based on what ‘appears faster’ and therefore might prefer to cut through Invergowrie rather than risk a relatively short delay at a traffic signal.”Ms Beer said that there had been 24 crashes on Main Street since 1999, which was more than similar villages in the area, and called for traffic surveys to be carried out if the work goes ahead. “This would allow the measurement of any resulting changes in (traffic) flow,” she added.“If there is such a change, with more vehicles travelling through Invergowrie, then a commitment to carry out any remedial works or an appropriate financial contribution should be required.”Councillor Richard McCready, whose West End ward includes the roundabout, said he had asked the council for details on the impact of the upgrade.He said: “Theoretically this should be a good thing but I don’t think the four ways you can go on this roundabout have equal traffic volumes.“I also want to make sure there are no adverse affects to the air quality in the area.”No details have yet been revealed on when the work to upgrade the roundabout will take place.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

care \u0026ndash is being proposed by a newly appointed champion.After months of stinging criticism over its treatment of people with autism NHS Highland has appointed occupational therapist Arlene Johnstone to be its first head of service for learning disabilities and autism.The health board faced a storm of criticism over its decision to withdraw a \u0026pound23,000 grant for the Highland One Stop Shop (HOSS) autism support service last year and it was subsequently criticised by autism expert Dr Sue Fletcher-Watson, of Edinburgh University\u0027s Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences, regarding an equality impact document that showed \"total ignorance\".Ms Johnstone says she is now keen to move on from the past, bringing a determinedly inclusive approach to her work.Acting as an advocate within the health service for autistic people and those with learning disabilities has already seen her challenging NHS colleagues drawing up policy in a range of areas to make sure their needs are properly considered.Beyond what is happening internally within the NHS she says she is also keen to reach out to partners in both the third sector and business.\"I think it is easy to say \u0027the NHS has to change\u0027 and there are things we have to change, absolutely, but there is also lots of things that have to change outside of the health service and the social care world,\" she said.Listing banks, bus companies, cafes and shopping centres as the kinds of private organisations she would like to talk to about boosting their autism-friendly credentials she added: \"I think it is crucial, because most people\u0027s quality of life is not about when they visit the GP it is when they go out with their pals socialising.\"A spokeswoman for Autism Rights Group Highland has given a cautious welcome to Ms Johnstone\u0027s appointment, saying the group knows her well and is eager to find out more about her role.Ms Johnstone is happy to hear from anyone with concerns or

Israeli medical technology firm Insightec has had the blessing of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) which advises British health authorities.Essential tremor (ET) and similar conditions impact people\u0027s ability to perform everyday tasks due to uncontrollable shaking.Sufferers treated at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in London have experienced substantial improvement after access to the equipment, according to senior surgeons.The machine enables ultrasound waves to pass through the skull to the part of the brain responsible for the tremor.Due to the incision-less nature of focused ultrasound, there is no risk of infection and patients recover quickly.Mary Ramsay (61), a lifelong ET sufferer, has had to travel 450 miles to Newcastle \u0026ndash but for an alternative and invasive treatment. No other relevant technology was available anywhere in Scotland.Her case sparked a recent debate in the Scottish Parliament in support of her campaign for specialist equipment nearer home.She said: \"I\u0027m highly delighted. It\u0027s now up to the health boards.\"I\u0027d urge those in the north and east to consider having the focus ultrasound scanner because there\u0027s currently nothing for people with neurological problems, ET or otherwise, in these areas. I don\u0027t feel it\u0027s fair to have everything centralised in one place.\"Highlands and Islands Labour MSP Rhoda Grant, who has worked closely with Mrs Ramsay to secure such specialist equipment for the north, said: \"The waiting list is likely to grow further for treatments south of the border.\"So, Nice\u0027s statement makes it even more important that Scotland has its own treatment programme.

He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate.

McInnes said: “Sometimes you need those forward players to make the difference to turn one point into three.”On a positive day for McInnes, summer signings Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson also delivered solid debuts.Centre-back Mikey Devlin finally made his debut six months after signing on at Pittodrie.Devlin had been out for more than a year with a cruciate ligament damage but cruised through the game against Cobh.But it was Forrester who stole the show with the vital goal.McInnes said: “In terms of his touch and his passing ability the reason we brought Chris here was because he can be the difference.“I think Chris can be that for us either through his assists or his goals.“It is something that is important to him, to be more relevant in the final third rather than just be seen as a good passer.“Against Cobh Ramblers he was the difference with a lovely finish with his left foot.“He just shifts the ball on to it and gives us that bit of quality.“He scored a good goal and it was one that we deserved as we were the better side.”Dubliner Forrester was introduced on the half-hour mark at the Fota Island Resort.With the mercury hitting close to 30 degrees it was decided by both teams to split the match into three half-hour sections.McInnes said: “Chris is a confident boy and has to get used to the demands of us as well.“There were moments when you could see his quality.“His touch is so true, he plays with his head up and the crispness of passing is there.“Chris has some work to do to make sure his game is that bit more rounded for us.“That is the demands we are going to put on him.”Striker Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the team for the friendly having picked up knocks in training.McInnes is confident both will be fit to face Falkirk on Wednesday at Arbroath’s Gayfield stadium.The manager said: “Stevie and Sam are fine.“The ground was rock hard and maybe we over-worked them on Thursday.“Both have worked extremely well and looked sharp in the football work we have done.“It was just at the tail-end of the work on Thursday when we pushed them a wee bit.“The physios have guaranteed they will be good to go for Falkirk.”Aberdeen faced Ramblers just nine days after returning for pre-season training.In contrast the Cork-based side are midway through their domestic league.McInnes was impressed with the centre-back partnership of Devlin and Scott McKenna who never looked troubled by Cobh.However, he accepts the Reds, who hit the post through Adam Rooney, needed to be sharper up front.McInnes said: “There was a lot of good from that game.“It is a step towards where we want to be and we want to make those gradual improvements as we go along.“There was some sloppiness as you would expect.“Even though we were against a team who we were expected to beat you could see they were a bit sharper to the ball.“You could see they were a team in mid- season.“We have to make sure that we make those little steady improvements as we go along.“I can’t be disappointed as a clean sheet was never really in doubt.“We defended well and worked hard enough.“When you make so many changes in a game sometimes it upsets the fluency.“It has been a strong week for some and there is more work for some to get up to where we want.“In terms of what the players have given us since we came back in I am really pleased with their fitness levels.“I was just looking for that wee bit more quality and goal threat from the game. But other than that I have to be pleased.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"038ex0207eea_story__9","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes’ summer rebuilding is already paying off as all three new signings made solid debuts against Cobh Ramblers.So early in the pre-season the new faces integrating into the team so quickly can only bode well for the Battle of Britain with Burnley.This friendly in the searing heat of Cork was the first step on the road to that Europa League showdown with the Premier League Clarets on July 26.McInnes hopes to bring in more new faces before that second qualifying round first leg.However, the ones he has already secured look like they will play key roles for the Reds in the upcoming season.There was also the added bonus of the long-awaited debut of centre-back Mikey Devlin, six months after signing on for the Dons in January.Midfielder Chris Forrester was secured in a £200,000 deal from Peterborough to be a game-changer with a touch of magic or goal.He netted with an impressive finish and was busy in an attacking midfield role.Republic of Ireland international Stephen Gleeson played in the defensive midfield role alongside skipper Graeme Shinnie and brought real bite and controlled aggression.He was also calm in possession and always looked to find attackers with passes.Midfielder Lewis Ferguson, although 18, showed he will be pushing for a start and will not be content with a bit-part role.This match was moved from the original venue of Cobh Ramblers’ St Colman’s Ground to the Dons’ complex at Fota Island Resort.Essentially it was a match on a training field with a hundred or so Dons supporters scattered on a slight incline watching the action in balmy heat.It may have been a glorified bounce game for most but for defender Devlin this match was everything – the end of more than a year of hell.It was his first game action for 406 days and the chance to finally put behind him the cruciate ligament damage sustained in May 2017 while at Hamilton.Devlin signed for the Reds in January but had yet to kick a ball for them having spent his time at Pittodrie completing his rehab.If there was any apprehension about his debut it didn’t show as Devlin coasted through this match.He looked like he had been playing alongside centre-back partner Scott McKenna for seasons such was their understanding and communication.The duo are good friends off the pitch and share a flat. That connection clearly transfers to the pitch.The McKenna-Devlin partnership with Gleeson and Graeme Shinnie in front could be the rock-hard spine of the team next season.Against Cobh there was ring rust as expected as it was the Dons’ first game in nearly six weeks since the Premiership campaign ended.There were chances missed and over-hit passes but that will come during pre-season.Crucially it looked like the Reds were a unit and that the new signings had settled effortlessly into it.Cobh Ramblers are midway through their season and played on the night before this match.They lost 2-1 to Drogheda United 315 miles away and didn’t return back to Cork until 2am.Some of the players from that game faced the Dons.New signing Ferguson was pitched in from the start for his debut following his move from Hamilton.Aberdeen and Hamilton have still to go to an SPFL tribunal for arbitration over the training compensation due for the teen. The Reds offered in excess of £100,000 for the highly-rated player, although it is believed Hamilton place him at around the £900,000 mark.Aberdeen are confident a tribunal will find a figure closer to their valuation.Ferguson impressed with intelligent play and awareness.Strikers Stevie May and Sam Cosgrove were both left out of the squad having picked up minor knocks during training. Both are expected to be fit to face Falkirk in a friendly on Wednesday.Around 100 Dons fans turned up for the friendly. The weather sizzled, but the game action didn’t.Aberdeen created the opening chance in the second minute when Frank Ross found Shinnie with a cross but the skipper’s drive was blocked by keeper Adam Mylod’s legs.In the 17th minute Devlin headed across the face of goal and inches wide after connecting with a cross from Ross on the right.Moments later midfielder Ferguson had a 15-yard powerful low drive blocked at the near post by a defender.Both debutants were unlucky not to find the back of the net in that opening half hour.Such was the heat, touching 30 degrees, the game was broken up into three 30-minute periods.Having put in industrious shifts the youngsters Wright, Ferguson, Ross and Campbell came off on the half-hour mark.The two new signings of Forrester and Gleeson were both introduced with Gary Mackay-Steven and Niall McGinn also coming on.Aberdeen were denied a strong penalty claim in the 32nd minute when Adam Rooney was upended in the box but the referee waved play on.Striker Rooney was in the thick of the action again when his eight-yard header rattled off the keeper’s left post.In the 46th minute Mackay-Steven flighted a cross along the face of goal to find McGinn but the winger’s header was inches wide.Soon after McGinn fired a 25-yard free-kick high over the bar.The performance of Northern Ireland international McGinn was also a positive from this friendly.McGinn missed the final games of last season with a groin problem but looked sharp, fit and revitalised against Cobh.The opener came in the 62nd minute through debutant FORRESTER, who underlined how potent he can be up front.He is renowned for some stunning goals during his time at St Patrick’s Athletic and Peterborough, goals that are popular on Youtube.This wasn’t quite up there with those internet favourites but it was still an excellent finish.Winger Mackay-Steven burst down the flank and passed to Shinnie, who rolled the ball into the path of the summer signing.Midfielder Forrester then confidently fired home from the edge of the penalty area.ABERDEEN (first period): Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Rooney, Wright, Devlin, Ferguson, Ross, Campbell.Aberdeen (second period): Lewis, Logan, Shinnie, Considine, McKenna, Rooney, Forrester, Devlin (Reynolds 45), Mackay-Steven, McGinn, Gleeson.Aberdeen (third period): Rogers, Logan (Harrington 76), Shinnie, Reynolds, Considine, McKenna, Anderson, Forrester, Mackay-Steven, McGinn, Gleeson.COBH RAMBLERS (first period): Mylod, Fleming, O’Connor, Walker, McSureeny, D Murphy, Broderer, Christopher, E Murphy, Cronin, Fernandos.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"46k boost gets show on road for good cause","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA stage school and charity is celebrating after receiving nearly £50,000 in a national funding scheme.Music 4 U was one of five groups in the North Scotland category that reached the final of the People’s Project 2018.The charity, which offers artistic opportunities to young people aged between 16 and 25, has walked away with £46,465.The People’s Project, which is in its 13th year, is run by the Big Lottery Fund along with The National Lottery, STV and ITV.Music 4 U now has the funding in place to start its Music 4 Communities project which will take performances to people who may otherwise struggle to see live stage shows.Debbie Kirkness, founder and director of Music 4 U, said: “We’ve been a charity since 2005 and it has only really been in the last 18 months that people have been finding out about us and what we do.“Getting the funding for our Music 4 Communities project means everything to us.“We will be able to stage showcases with young people and we support people from all walks of life including with learning and physical disabilities.“We will then be able to take our showcases to communities that might not be able to go to live performances or would struggle to visit somewhere like a theatre.

faster.\u0026#8220I look forward to full power later in the summer.”Adam Ezzamel, Vattenfall’s EOWDC project director, said: “We have overcome major engineering and technical challenges to achieve first power on the cutting edge EOWDC thanks to the collective expertise of Vattenfall, and our contractors MHI Vestas, Boskalis and Murphy.\u0026#8220Our priority now is to fully commission the windfarm safely throughout the summer.\u0026#8220First power from EOWDC reinforces north-east Scotland’s status as Europe’s energy capital and will help establish the region as an international centre for offshore wind generation.”Jean Morrison, chair of Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group (AREG) added: “The timescale between the first installation and first power is remarkable.\u0026#8220The techniques and innovations developed at the EOWDC will be hugely significant for the industry and should help to reduce the future costs of offshore wind.\u0026#8220As energy demand grows, we need to maximise the returns from our natural resources and offshore wind can help us do that.”Scottish Government energy minister Paul Wheelhouse said: “This is a very significant milestone for the 93.2MW European Offshore Wind Deployment Centre (EOWDC).\u0026#8220I congratulate the project team at Vattenfall for not only a successful installation but also their achievement in generating electricity from the world’s most powerful offshore wind turbines which, with each rotation at full power, will generate enough energy to power a home for 24 hours.“Once the test and demonstration site is fully operational, not only will this help the offshore wind sector to further reduce its costs through lessons learned during operations, but the output from EOWDC will itself add significantly to Scotland’s renewable electricity generating capacity, building on figures announced last month that showed installed capacity reached a record 10.4GW in the first three months of 2018 and which also provisionally indicated that renewable sources met an equivalent of 69% of Scotland’s electricity demand in 2017.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/06/36333504_856164751242018_4546782074673037312_o-940x529.jpg ","title":"fog forces medical helicopter to land

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland. The last time I crossed Scotland for the appeal I was swimming and running, so cycling has to be easier… right?\u0026#8217He added: \u0026#8216Thanks to everyone who gets involved and I look forward to riding with you.\u0026#8217Mari Slavin of the STV Children’s Appeal said: \u0026#8216Mark is a fantastic ambassador for the Appeal and we are all in awe of the gigantic challenge he’s about to take on, together with cyclists from across the country. STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Would you know who most at risk is, how to protect the area or whether you should remove the helmet of a downed rider?Following the success of the Biker Down courses last year in Oban Community Fire Station, new dates have been set for this summerTwo free sessions will be held in Inveraray Community Fire Station on July 8 and August 26 .As many bikers ride in pairs or in groups, it is often the case that the first person on scene following a collision involving a motorcycle will be a fellow biker.Actions taken in the first few moments after an accident can be crucial in minimising injuries and can make a real difference to the lives of those involved. But there can be some uncertainty about what to do in these situations.Training motorcyclists in how to deal with a casualty can save lives and Biker Down courses include ways of keeping the scene safe, first aid appropriate to common types of injury and the issues of safely removing a helmet.The course \u0026#8211 aimed at motorcyclists of all ages and experience \u0026#8211 uses the expertise of the emergency services to prepare motorcyclists should the worst happen on the roads. Biker Down is not about lecturing riders on the consequences of things going wrong – it is about equipping them to make a difference if they encounter an emergency.The course will show you:How to manage the scene of a bike crash, using the same principles the Fire Service uses. We will show you how to protect yourself and others, how to prioritise your actions, how to collect information for the emergency services and how to make use of the resources you have available to you, including other people.Ways of taking care of a casualty, including basic life support and the why, when and how of removing a crash helmet.What may work (or not work) when it comes to making yourself more visible to other road users. You will also learn about how people look for and recognise objects and how you can help to make sure that other road users see you.Scottish Fire and Rescue Service’s group manager for Argyll and Bute, Stuart McLean said: \u0026#8216Firefighters are frequently called to the scene of collisions and when a report comes through of one involving a biker there’s always great concern. Motorcyclists are particularly vulnerable and a crash that would be likely to cause only minor damage to a car could easily claim their life.

The star of the show for Brian and Janet, however, was a home-bred ewe which took first prize in her class and was reserve female champion.Campbeltown\u0026#8217s John MacLachlan was there showing Blue Faced Leicester sheep for J\u0026ampM Turner, Killdalloig with the help of Gavin Semple and Scott Thomason.He came home with a first place and reserve male champion rosette for his tup lamb, sired by Mossvale Masterplan (AI) from a mother out of a Hazelwood ewe.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s the first time out for this lamb, said John, and this is the first time I\u0026#8217ve won with a male at the Highland Show, it\u0026#8217s normally females we do well with.\u0026#8217Kildalloig also secured sixth places for their tup and ewe lamb and fourth for a shearling tup.In the coloured Bluefaced Leicester ring, Lochgoilhead\u0026#8217s Andrew Campbell came second with a tup lamb and sixth with his ewe.

Collapsing ceilings and water leakage have led to a further deterioration in the fabric of the Victorian pile.  Now it is understood South Ayrshire Council bosses want to step in before it is too late. It is believed a last minute paper may go before councillors at full council in County Buildings on Thursday. The paper would ask politicians to approve the repair work. The council slapped a Dangerous Building Notice on the hotel in March, which gave the owners 21 days to respond. There are fears Ayr train station could end up shut if no action is taken. And it has been slammed a risk to the public. The Post revealed earlier this month how the hotel has been bought by new Malaysian owners from Eng Huat Ung.  Station Hotel Action Group founder Esther Clark believes the hotel could be turned into a community centre and accomodation. She said it should be “split up and dispersed” but must generate an income. She has uncovered research, which reveals the hotel was built to a “high standard” with luxurious materials. One idea mooted by Ayr Renaissance is for a part of the building to be demolished and a new train station built. Others folk have called for the council to adopt the landmark for offices. It was hoped a big hotel group would step in and carry out refurbishment but it has failed to attract interest so far. Network Rail carried out scaffolding work on the building to safeguard the operation of the station and line in 2015. The hotel, a Grade 2 listed building, has remained shut since it closed suddenly in 2013. Glasgow and South-Western Railway Company built the hotel, designed in the style of a French chateau, at a cost of \u0026pound50,000.

And one glance around a packed Troon Town Hall said everything about the young woman Vanessa Riddle had become. Her impact was deep, her reach was far. “Vanessa would wonder why everyone was here for her,” said dad Chris. “That’s just the kind of person she was.” Friends, family, school pals and members of the community all touched by Vanessa’s courage joined for the special service.  Her battle with neuroblastoma had been one that ensured she will never be forgotten by all lucky enough to know her. Speaking to more than 400 people at her memorial service, Chris said: “She lit up our world. “And in her short life, she packed in so much happiness. “Vanessa was a thrillseeker with a soft side – great with old and young alike. “She had the Midas touch.” And he added: “No words can describe how utterly proud we are to have been your father, mother and sister.  “This is not the end for you, you have now moved on to something new.” The emotional speech came as the Town Hall paid tribute to Vanessa, of Loans, who lost her brave battle just days short of her 18th birthday. Some of Vanessa’s closest childhood friends took their feet to recount memories of happy times of the girl with a smile for everyone. And Vanessa’s infamous parking skills and ability to make everyone laugh were just two of the themes to strike a chord. Graham Hobson, deputy head at Marr College, was another to speak warmly of an immensely popular pupil. Chris said afterwards: “I thought the speeches were great, especially Vanessa’s friends, who at only 18 spoke so eloquently and passionately about Vanessa - they belied their age doing this.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"were-so-proud-of-him-parents-of-galashiels-scout-with-adhd-hope-to-inspire-others-to-join-group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

SS took his portion of fish after his family were fed and satisfied.\nLater that same day, SS returned with more fish and he was certainly making up for lost time.\nHe began to feed the youngsters himself while Mrs O was preening. The chicks were visibly stronger and more energised than the day before when they were hungry.\nAfter the first chick was full it lay down on its side while the other chick fed and when it had had enough to eat, chick number one would get up and come back over for seconds.\nThe week progressed into warm weather and scorching sunshine and the chicks ranged from being sleepy and still, to being far too adventurous, toddling about the nest using their budding wings as little stilts to enable them to clamber around.\nThese little excursions led them to venture too far to the edges and the parent birds used distraction with fish to bring them away and back into the middle.\nThey also began to pay more attention to the nest construction, by moving sticks around and building up the edges, like little safety barriers to prevent any toppling over the edge.\nSadly, for one osprey family in the Borders, two chicks did fall to their death from the nest during the recent high winds.\nBut the attentive Mrs O and SS seem to have metaphorically red taped the danger zone by building stick walls just high enough to prevent any earnest climbing from a curious young osprey wanting to peer over the side.\nvar panels = panels || []var panel = {    name: \u0027RelatedArticles\u0027,    target: \u0027related-articles\u0027,    params: {ns: \u0027redesign\u0027, \u0027article_ids\u0027: \u002716326935,16326589,16326578,16326073,16323973\u0027, \u0027more_articles_heading\u0027: \u0027More articles\u0027}}panels.push(panel)\nBy now, the young ospreys have grown stronger and the fluffy down is spotted with the onset of growing feathers.\nThey no longer look feeble and weak and their fortunes have rapidly turned around since the fish supply has picked up.\nWe finally have news of PX1 (Paxman\u0027s bird) whose satellite tracker alerted us to the fact that he had died in the north of Scotland near to the Helmsdale River.\nThe carcass and tag have been recovered and it seems that his neck was broken, we believe, from colliding into newly erected deer fencing along the side of a forestry plantation.\nIt is such a terrible shame to lose this wonderful, healthy, two-year-old male osprey.\nJeremy Paxman was very saddened to hear of the loss of this bird and we are very grateful to him for his interest and support for the Tweed Valley Osprey Project.\nHe has agreed that his involvement will continue in the future, through the tracking of further ospreys.\nThe volunteers for the osprey project were invited to attend the ringing of goshawk chicks this week in Tweed Valley Forest Park and they were privileged to witness them being fitted with red darvic rings with white letters of JP and PL, by Tony Lightley, after Eve Schulte climbed the fir tree to lower them to the forest floor.\nRhona Anderson took some great photos of these magnificent birds and she has also been filming pine martens in the forest.\nThe captured footage of the whole pine marten family together and the antics of the three little kits with their mum and dad can be viewed in the video above or at \nhttps://www.flickr/photos/borderslass/28099626057/in/photostream/\nRead the latest Tweed Valley Osprey News every week throughout the summer in the Border  and Peeblesshire News newspapers\n"},{"url":null,"title":"500-mile-cycle-across-scotland-raises-20k-for-charity","story":"AN INNERLEITHEN man has cycled 516 miles in five days \u0026ndash raising \u0026pound21,000 for charity.\nMountain biker Kevin Marshall recently completed the mammoth challenge around the north Scottish coastline \u0026ndash all in aid of a cause close to his heart.\nThe idea to take on the challenge originated during a mountain biking trip to Glencoe last August, when Kevin, and his friend Steve, both agreed they wanted to do something to support the charities Macmillan and Friends of Anchor, who helped Steve\u0026rsquos mum and dad, and Kevin\u0026rsquos mum, before they passed away.\nKevin said: \u0026ldquoWe agreed that the North Coast 500 (NC500) was a suitably tough challenge, both to raise awareness and hopefully raise a reasonable amount of cash.\n\u0026ldquoThe team that completed the ride with me are all very close friends, the majority of us met when we were 18 when we started university in Aberdeen and have been close friends ever since.

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

Graham Esq. of Skipness.The little church, decorated with white marguerites and ferns picked by the children attending Skipness school, was full of friendly well-wishers, many of whom had known the bride from her infancy.The bride wore a simple white georgette gown trimmed with Italian lace given by her aunt, Lady Monkswell, and a veil of old Brussels lace over a wreath of small white roses.Round her neck was a necklace of lapis lazuli and gold, the gift of her brother, Mr R.F. Graham, and she carried a large bouquet of wild flowers, gathered by the boys of the place.She was attended by seven little girls from the village as bridesmaids.In spite of the war and the tempestuous weather, many flags had appeared and the village was gay with sunshine, flowers and bunting as Mr and Mrs R.G.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-pub-seeking-new-owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Organised by the darts team at The Riverside Tavern, the event was one of several held throughout the year which raised a total of \u0026pound7,787.  The cash was divided between Prostate Scotland, which helps prostate cancer sufferers, and ward 1, unit 4, oncology, for patients with cancer at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh \u0026ndash each receiving \u0026pound3,893.  The latter was chosen as the darts team\u0026rsquos captain, Michael Burgess, was treated there for leukaemia.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to give something back as they really looked after us, he said.  The walk was the pub\u0026rsquos fourth and final charity event of the year and followed a bowls competition, eight-hour darts marathon and darts competition. Participants walked six miles from The Riverside to Portobello via the promenade.  In April, a thief stole the pub\u0026rsquos collection bottle containing about \u0026pound400 but local taxi owner John Cullen stepped in to hold a bonus ball fundraiser when he heard about the break-in.  Over 32 years, the pub\u0026rsquos darts team has raised more than \u0026pound100,000 for different charities. Led by John Campbell from Whitecraig, the players have held everything from collections to 12-hour darts marathons and competitions, and annual fancy dress sponsored walks during their time based at the Deantown Bowling Club and former Dolphin Inn at Whitecraig, and now The Riverside.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

North Berwick\u0026rsquos Law Primary School P6 pupils were looking forward to the trip to Yellowcraig, by Dirleton, where one class was due to camp out tonight (Wednesday) and another tomorrow (Thursday).  Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.  The school is still going ahead with the daytime activities planned as part of the camp but asked parents to pick up their children from Yellowcraig at 7pm.  Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out. This has various implications for our risk assessments for the trip and, having taken advice from a number of sources, we have decided not to stay overnight at the site this week.  \u0026ldquoWe realise this will be disappointing news and apologise for any inconvenience, but we will look into the possibility of the pupils having a night in tents at another venue after the summer.  The camping trip is usually held in a field on the left of the road leading into the car parks at Yellowcraig.  An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWhile the pupils will be taking part in all of the planned activities, arrangements are being made for them to be picked up at 7pm instead of camping overnight.  \u0026ldquoThis decision has been taken as the school understands there may be a number of people already using the area.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes. It\u0026rsquos important that we listen to the views of staff, pupils, parents, carers and other stakeholders. That\u0026rsquos why I\u0026rsquom pleased cabinet has agreed that the council will hold a consultation and carry out a feasibility study. This will be launched in due course.

They say they are being overlooked by customers at the supermarket car park who can see through the fence into the communal garden area in front of their ground-floor properties at Mill House on Eskmills Road, which is managed by Dunedin Canmore Housing Association.  Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.

We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.

Residents such as Seona Mason-Chadburn, who lives in Dunbar town centre, contacted the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Tarmac, which operates Dunbar Cement Plant to the south-east of the town, about the discharge.  She told the Courier how she had attempted to use her window wipers to clear her front windscreen, only to discover the dust.  She said her windscreen felt like \u0026ldquosandpaper and compared the dust to the \u0026ldquobloom on a black grape.  A spokesman for SEPA added: \u0026ldquoEvery day SEPA works to protect and enhance Scotland\u0026rsquos environment and we are clear that compliance is non-negotiable.  \u0026ldquoIn response to local complaints, SEPA officers responded to reports of significant dust in the Dunbar area.  \u0026ldquoOfficers identified the source of the dust and are working with Tarmac to prevent a re-occurrence.  \u0026ldquoWe would advise members of the public to contact our 24-hour pollution hotline on 0800 807060 to report pollution events.  Tarmac has confirmed that the dust escaped, with an internal investigation being carried out.  Oliver Curtin, plant manager, said: \u0026ldquoIn the early hours of May 24 we experienced an isolated and brief incident where a small amount of limestone-based dust escaped from the site.  \u0026ldquoWe took action quickly and have been working with SEPA and conducting our own investigations to prevent a recurrence. We\u0026rsquore committed to minimising our environmental impact and apologise for any inconvenience caused. If anyone has any concerns or queries they can contact us at dunbar.feedback@tarmac  The incident took place when some clinker (nodules of cement) was being loaded into a store.  As soon as the discharge was detected, the process was \u0026ldquoimmediately shut down but \u0026ldquounfortunately some dust had already escaped into the atmosphere, said Tarmac.  The dry weather and wind direction resulted in the dust being carried towards Dunbar.  Tarmac has sent out a letter to residents and offered to arrange for cars to be washed at the company\u0026rsquos expense.  Additional CCTV cameras have now been installed on site to improve the company\u0026rsquos ability to gain an external view of its operations."},{"url":null,"title":"flag-ceremony-held-to-mark-armed-forces-day","story":"              A SPECIAL flag to mark Armed Forces Day was raised at Haddington Town House on Monday as East Lothian Provost John McMillan was joined by Lord Lieutenant Michael Williams and members of his cadets.  The ceremony marked the start of a week of celebrations across Scotland to mark the contribution members of the armed forces make.  Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"              A NORTH Berwick-based butcher is celebrating after it was judged the makers of Scotland\u0026rsquos finest black pudding.

The debate during Health Question Time at Holyrood last Wednesday followed a recent public meeting which was organised by East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield and Lothian MSP Kezia Dugdale (both Labour) at the Fisherrow Centre, which attracted more than 200 people.  Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"              VIKTOR Krum, Percy Weasley and Malfoy\u0027s sidekick Goyle are all heading to Musselburgh this summer to join in the fun as Harry Potter\u0027s \u0026lsquoSchool of Witchcraft \u0026amp Wizardry\u0026rsquo arrives in the town.

WE ALL know that tadpoles turn into frogs. Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"              SCOTTISH Ministers are to be urged to refuse planning permission for an electrical substation on the former Cockenzie Power Station site because it could prejudice future development there.  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"              MUSSELBURGH\u0026rsquoS \u0026lsquoglory days\u0026rsquo in the history of golf are shared with visitors to the town\u0026rsquos museum this summer.  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"              THE A198 has been closed and emergency services are at the scene after a car accident near Gullane.

The 27-year-old singer-songwriter, who announced his engagement to long-time girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn, in January, had submitted a planning application for the Saxon-style structure to Suffolk Coastal District Council.  However, permission was refused by planning officers under delegated powers, with a report stating this was due to the \u0026ldquoprinciple of the unsustainable form of development in the countryside.  It said the proposed 48ft (14.6m) church tower would be \u0026ldquoin conflict with the prevailing landscape character, creating the impression of a second village church.  Suffolk Wildlife Trust had also voiced concerns about the possible impact on great crested newts.  The proposed flint chapel would have held a congregation of around 24.  The application stated there was a need for the chapel as \u0026ldquoit is every person\u0026rsquos right to be able to have a place of retreat for contemplation and prayer, for religious observance, celebration of key life and family milestones, marriages, christenings and so forth."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8007311.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"facebook-rolls-out-advertising-transparency-tools","story":"              Facebook says it is making advertising on the social network more \u0026ldquotransparent by publishing more information about the adverts firms are running on the site.

On Thursday, Glasgow recorded its hottest day since records began as another sweltering day saw the temperature peak at 31.9C (89.4F).  The city beat Wednesday\u0026rsquos high of 31.3C (88.3F) in Aviemore in the Highlands, and came close to matching the hottest June day ever recorded in Scotland - 32.2C (89.9F) at Ochtertyre in Perth and Kinross in 1893.  As tens of thousands of music lovers flock to Glasgow for TRNSMT at Glasgow Green and Fiesta x Fold in Kelvingrove Park, revellers are being urged to stock up on sunscreen and water.  Temperatures in the city will dip slightly, but it will still be warm for the week ahead with plenty of sunshine and temperatures around the 25C mark.  The first hosepipe ban is likely to come into place in Northern Ireland this weekend.  Northern Ireland Water said demand is outstripping supply, leaving them with no option but to bring in the ban in order to save water.  Scottish Water said it is managing supplies across the country and will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Only two localised areas in Scotland have been issued with advice to \u0026ldquouse water wisely - parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis.  Other parts of the UK have urged water consumers to take simple steps to reduce the amount they use.  Top tips include taking a shorter shower, not leaving the taps running and re-using paddling pool water for plants in the garden.  Met Office spokesman Grahame Madge said: \u0026ldquoWe are going to see a continuation of the current warm spell, but the temperatures over the next few days are not likely to be the warmest of the year so far.  \u0026ldquoI think, for now, temperatures have peaked and we are not expecting to see any records today.  \u0026ldquoWe will begin to have a slightly fresher feel, bringing the temperatures down, not by much, by one or two degrees.  Gritters have been deployed in some areas, spreading crushed rock dust onto melting roads to create a non-stick layer between the surface and vehicles.  Motorists have been advised to use warm soapy water to wash sticky tar from their vehicles.  Some railway tracks have soared to nearly 50C (122F), leading them to expand and bend.  ScotRail customers have seen massive disruption across the Glasgow network for three days now as the railway lines buckle in the hot weather, with many speed restriction in place for train drivers.  The Met Office\u0026rsquos heat-health watch alert has remained at level two all week, meaning social and healthcare services are at the ready to reduce harm from a potential heatwave.  This week is the first time since 2013 all four nations in the UK have seen temperatures of 30C or above, the Met Office said.  The rising temperatures have also come with warnings to be careful near water and in the countryside, where fire crews have been tackling wildfires, including one in Bathgate.  The heat has already claimed casualties.  The family of 13-year-old Ryan Evans, whose body was recovered on Wednesday, two days after he got into difficulty at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, warned of the dangers of playing and swimming in open water.  They said: \u0026ldquoWe just cannot emphasise enough the dangers of swimming in open water, especially where young children are concerned.  \u0026ldquoOur message is simple: please don\u0027t do it.  A 17-year-old boy was found dead in the River Aire in Leeds in the early hours of Wednesday morning following a search and rescue operation.  It is believed he got into difficulties while swimming on Tuesday evening.  The body of a man was also recovered from a lake in Nutfield, Surrey, on Monday.  The RNLI has urged those heading to the seaside to seek out beaches with a lifeguard.  There is bad news for farmers growing crops and the firefighters and soldiers battling the ongoing incident on Saddleworth Moor in north-west England as no significant rainfall is forecast in the coming days.  Parts of the Moor have been alight for six days, with firefighters saying it could take weeks to extinguish.  A new moorland blaze - on Winter Hill, near Rivington, Lancashire - broke out on Thursday with huge plumes of smoke visible from the area surrounding the moorland.  Firefighters are also still fighting a 500-metre long gorse fire on the Glenshane Pass in County Londonderry, more than 48 hours after it first broke out.  The RSPCA called on pet owners to keep a close eye on their animals in the heat after receiving 625 calls about animals in hot environments between June 11 and 24 - the majority about dogs in hot cars."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7996889.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"trnsmt-2018-bar-prices-at-glasgow-festival-revealed","story":"              THE bar prices have been revealed for TRNSMT festival.

Picking a favourite Scottish album from such a packed field was always going to be a tough task, and so it proved when we asked readers to do just that.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For more than 25 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

Whilst travelling\u0026nbspthrough India he came across an old British school satchel\u0026nbspand taken by the design, he decided to get a few made by local artisans. He sold these satchels from the attic in his home, as well as a few vintage furniture pieces from India. These satchels and vintage furniture proved to be quiet popular as they were items people couldn\u0027t get anywhere else.  Things started to grow.\u0026nbspToday,\u0026nbspScaramanga is made up of a team of 10 and has become a globally recognized brand that sells online as well as out of their shop in Cupar. They\u0026nbsphave expanded a\u0026nbsprange of bags to over 50 popular designs and have had their vintage and antique furniture featured in major Hollywood films and television shows.    The design team still gets inspiration from the traditional old school satchel. You\u0027ll see the qualities of a timeless style met with top quality leather in all the bag designs. Men and women of all ages can find a style\u0026nbspthat suits them whether it\u0027s for work, adventure or travel.

The team are proud to get reviews such as \u0027I\u0027ve had my bag for 7 years now and it still keeps better and better with age!\u0027. The signature Hunter leather\u0026nbsplasts for years, thanks to it being\u0026nbspdurable, thick, naturally distressed and it gets better with age. It\u0027s also ethically sourced and comes from the same suppliers we\u0027ve been working with for over 11 years now.\u0026nbsp  The vintage furniture is unique, original and not reproduced. Because of this, we\u0027ve become a go-to for props buyers and set designers in film and television.

Here the sun always shines, the men have six packs, the women have curves in all the right places and the only thing you need to worry about is how much grafting (to use the show\u0027s lingo) you have to put into attracting the opposite sex.  Unless you\u0027ve been living in deep freeze, it\u0027s hard to escape the cultural phenomenon that is the Bafta-winning, dating reality TV show, Love Island. It revolves around a dizzying array of \u0026ldquosexy singles who purport to be looking for true love, along with the \u0026pound50,000 prize money (or, let\u0027s be honest, a launch pad for a celeb career), and spend up to eight weeks in a luxury villa in Mallorca trying to convince audiences that they\u0027ve found the man, or woman, of their dreams. It\u0027s knowingly narrated for laughs by Scottish comedian Iain Stirling and hosted by reality TV veteran Caroline Flack.  Whether or not it\u0027s working out for contestants, Love Island\u0027s fourth series is certainly pulling in the audiences of ITV2\u0027s dreams. An average 2.9 million people tuned in for the launch episode on June 4, more than double that of the first episode in 2017. Last week it was the highest-rating TV show at 9pm, with audiences \u0026ndash more than half of whom are in the 16-34 age range (the holy grail of TV producers) \u0026ndash peaking at 3.4million viewers. It has an overall audience share of 16 percent, that rises to almost 50 percent of younger viewers, and a whole range of merch.  Even if it sounds closer to your version of hell than paradise, there is no denying its widespread influence. But it\u0027s only a daft game show, right? As with any mainstream hit there\u0027s been plenty of sneering, about those who watch as much as those on-screen. In some ways you can see why.  In a month in which Donald Trump\u0027s immigration policies at the US border saw toddlers ripped from their mothers\u0027 arms and children kept in cages, while others were bombed in Yemen, could we really feel justified in worrying about whether Wes Nelson would be best off sticking with 29-year-old air hostess Laura Anderson or cracking on with surgically enhanced Megan Barton-Hanson? As Brexit negotiations continued to hurtle towards the cliff-edge, dragging us all towards who-knows-what, was it really OK to stuff our fingers in our ears until 9pm when we could relax into wondering if increasingly uptight and awkward A\u0026ampE doctor Alex George would finally convince a girl to fancy him?  Dr Faye Woods, lecturer in film and television at Reading University, dismisses this either/or view. She points out that while audiences of this female-targeted series are met with derision, it\u0027s not just socially acceptable, but actively expected, that men will down tools to watch the World Cup.  \u0026ldquoThis is an event bringing the nation together that isn\u0026rsquot terrible men\u0026rsquos footie, she says. \u0026ldquoLove Island gives us that space to breathe and focus on something else, a little oasis of pleasure amidst our current darkness. We can hold multiple thoughts in our brain simultaneously, and refocusing for a while every night is healthy for our well-being.  Which seems fair enough. And who doesn\u0027t like watching beautiful people? There\u0027s a fascination not just in their symmetrical features and gym-fit bodies, but in the amount of effort that goes into grooming \u0026ndash the carefully layered tans and whitened teeth, shaved chests, perfectly arched brows and painted nails (which mostly happens off camera, as if by magic).  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s a kind of vicarious pleasure, reckons Gladeana McMahon, a psychological adviser for reality shows such as the early Big Brother series, and the driving force behind the production of the \u0026ldquoEthical Guidelines for Reality TV produced by the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy. \u0026ldquoThis is the gladiatorial pit without the violence.  But as she points out, ITV2 has set out to get big audiences by going for a winning formula, that is, in many ways, nostalgic and safe. While it\u0027s supposedly all about glamour and sexual sizzle \u0026ndash once you\u0027re coupled up with someone you share a double bed in the dorm and see what you can get away with under the duvet \u0026ndash this dream seems in some ways weirdly old-fashioned.  In an age in which woke millennials are seemingly increasingly accepting of gender as a fluid rather than a binary concept, the stereotypes on display \u0026ndash where men talk about treating women like queens, being \u0026ldquogentlemen, and some of the girls play dumb to get the guy \u0026ndash pull progressive views up short.  It\u0027s all about the archetypes. Adam Collard \u0026ndash trading on Garden of Eden associations and looking for temptation \u0026ndash describes himself as tall, dark and handsome, with great abs. What more could anyone want, he wonders aloud? (A little bit of respect and common decency it turns out, but more of that later.)  As Nicola Bishop, a researcher in English and television at Manchester politan University, notes: \u0026ldquoThis is \u0026lsquopin-up\u0026rsquo TV with little diversity of body types. There is a lot of readable anxiety among the male competitors about measuring up against perceived physical ideals of masculinity.  The love on this heteronormative island is not for everyone. There are lots of reality TV shows that have been very positive about representing LGBT contestants \u0026ndash Brian Dowling, winner of Big Brother\u0027s second series, is testament to that. This isn\u0027t one of them. While last year\u0027s Love Island did include a short bisexual romance between two of the women, and host Caroline Flack hinted there may be gay contestants in the future, bosses are clear. It\u0027s a dating show for straight couples and everyone needs to fancy each other. They claim they wouldn\u0027t rule out a standalone show but none is forthcoming so far.  As versions of romance go, despite the bed-swapping, it\u0027s an interestingly traditional one. Several commentators have pointed out that with its claustrophobic sense of ennui, codified courting behaviour and double-crossing, the dream on offer has more than a whiff of Jane Austen about it all.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0027s the Diana story, it\u0027s Cinderella, adds McMahon. Considering the number of people getting married in the UK is at an all-time low, there\u0027s an awful lot of talk about it. Adam claims there\u0027s not a girl in the house that he wouldn\u0027t want as a wife, while Laura hints to 20-year-old Wes, after sharing a bed with him for a few weeks, that she\u0027s on the look-out for a husband.  While in the real world there might be an increasing acceptance of less traditional relationships, or even non-monogamous ones, what\u0027s on offer here is what writer and columnist Laurie Penny refers to as Love TM. This search for Mr or Mrs Right is what she calls \u0026ldquothe narrow romantic fantasy that trumps all other forms of love, which is put on a pedestal as the answer to all our life problems and insecurities and never questioned. As beautiful lawyer Rosie Williams, ditched by Adam, cries to the other girls \u0026ldquoI just want to be enough, you wish she already knew she was.  It is her experience too that shows the darker side of the fairytale \u0026ndash Hans Christian Andersen rather than Disney \u0026ndash with Women\u0027s Aid going as far as issuing a warning about spotting the signs of abuse in response to Adam\u0027s \u0026ldquogaslighting of her (a term used to describe psychological manipulation aimed at making someone question their version of reality). The charity said there were clear warning signs in Adam\u0027s behaviour of emotional abuse and called on viewers to speak out against unhealthy relationships.  Faye Woods claims that though it\u0027s \u0026ldquodistressing emotionally to watch this play out on television, it\u0027s been valuable \u0026ldquoin terms of understanding and awareness of everyday behaviour. She adds: \u0026ldquoI think of all the people who may have dismissed coercive control, but then saw it in practice with Adam and Rosie and then understood it.  Then there\u0027s the issue of race. From the off it was not lost on black women writers and commentators such as Danielle Dash who noticed the way the statuesquely beautiful Samira Mighty \u0026ndash the only black woman in the house \u0026ndash was over-looked by all the boys and ended up with Alex because he\u0027d been usurped in his first choice by another man. On Friday, with another cohort of boys arriving in the villa resolutely uninterested in her, she finally broke down claiming to be \u0026ldquoso confused.  On the outside there is less confusion as people fit the pieces together. There\u0027s the way the public \u0026ldquoforgot to vote for singer Alexandra Burke, who outdanced all her competitors week after week on Strictly Come Dancing and repeatedly ended up in the dance off, the black girls passed over in dating show Take Me Out, the racist incidents in Big Brother House\u0027s gone by. Reality TV, argue many, has form.  Dr Kehinde Andrews, professor of Black Studies at Birmingham City University, hasn\u0027t watched it but isn\u0027t surprised by the concerns. \u0026ldquoReality TV is popular because it resonates with people, he says. \u0026ldquoSo we shouldn\u0027t be surprised when it replicates the racism that we see in society. Actually television often shows a world that is artificially equal. It\u0027s very rare now that something like Midsomer Murders \u0026ndash showing an all-white world \u0026ndash will be commissioned. So we sometimes get a distorted view when in actual fact the country is really segregated. In reality TV we see the reality that society is dominated by ideas of white supremacy.  It\u0027s not just the way the characters interact \u0026ndash it\u0027s also the way it\u0027s cast and edited, he claims. \u0026ldquoIf you look at who made the show, who picked the characters, who commissioned it in the first place, you\u0027ll probably find that it reflects a bias, he adds. \u0026ldquoThey [producers] should be mindful of that, more responsible. But fixing Love Island isn\u0027t going to do anything. It\u0027s a symptom of the problem.  Though unlikely to start viewing now, he admits it\u0027s probably more important than some give it credit for. It\u0027s certainly important to the millions of fans, following contestants\u0027 Instagram accounts in their droves, live-tweeting their own social commentary, or dissecting it with their mates on group chat. On Twitter there\u0027s support for Samira, complaints about Adam and other men\u0027s behaviour towards the women, and of course the inevitable backlash, calling out double standards. Discussion around the \u0026ldquosexual shaming of the women, when contestants were asked to share the number of people they\u0027d slept with, was red hot. On screen Laura\u0027s 30 was initially met with embarrassed silence, while Adam\u0027s 200 with backslapping.  Yet writing in the Times earlier this month Caitlin Moran claimed it is that interaction that makes Love Island an unlikely vehicle for feminism \u0026ldquobecause we live in an era when every one of the classic tactics used by these men \u0026ndash gaslighting, denial, coercion, guilt \u0026ndash is met with a fabulous deconstruction on social media. For the first time we have live, rolling footage of total ledges trying the kind of mindf***y shenanigans that previously have happened in the privacy of bars or the back of cabs ... That smirk! If you see a man smirk like that, leave immediately by the nearest exit, for you are dealing with a human trash-fire.  Online chat is also about spotting who is genuine (ie the loveable Dani Dyer and her boyfriend, stationery salesman Jack Fincham, whose loyalty during separation had hearts melting) and who is faking it. Who is merely playing the game? It\u0027s a rolling audience commentary that underlines the fact that just being young doesn\u0027t make you dumb.  As Faye Woods says: \u0026ldquoReality TV is never real, and all viewers know this. It is non-viewers who attempt to dismiss them as gullible. Reality TV is built for savvy, sophisticated viewers, who are able to pivot effortlessly between awareness of this as constructed process and an emotional immersion.  Paradise, then, might be a great way to switch off. But, it turns out, Paradise deconstructed might have plenty to tell us about our society and youth culture today, as long as we\u0027re ready to listen."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-aide-says-nicola-sturgeons-reshuffle-lacked-due-diligence","story":"              THE chief of staff to Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos predecessor has criticised the lack of \u0026ldquodue diligence in advance of last week\u0026rsquos botched reshuffle.  Geoff Aberdein said the First Minister\u0026rsquos inner circle would be \u0026ldquokicking themselves over the on-off appointment of Gillian Martin as a minister.  Ms Sturgeon gave Ms Martin the further and higher education brief on Wednesday, but was forced to cancel her appointment the following day over her past blog writings.  In 2007, Ms Martin, then a college lecturer, had mocked transgender people and written in unflattering terms about \u0026ldquoAmerican Jews and \u0026ldquoAmerican blacks.  Ms Sturgeon had previously been aware of some of the transgender comments, including the notion of a \u0026ldquotranny trove of EU cash, as the blog was widely reported in 2016.  However more offensive material surfaced after Ms Martin was named a minister, including a remark about \u0026ldquohairy knuckled lipstick-wearing transitional transgender Laydees in colleges.  One of Ms Martin\u0026rsquos roles would have been to promote widening access to minorities.  Opposition parties said the episode had highlighted Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos poor judgment.  On BBC Sunday Politics Scotland, Mr Aberdein, who who was Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos top adviser from 2011 to 2014, was asked whether the reshuffle showed the SNP government was losing its previous sure-footedness.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt was unfortunate.  \u0026ldquoThe whole purpose of this reshuffle was to enter the summer recess on a high, with a bit of momentum, and of course the Gillian Martin saga has tarnished that.  \u0026ldquoI think the people around Ms Sturgeon will be kind of kicking themselves about the lack of due diligence here. Perhaps not as sure-footed as before.  \u0026ldquoBut you\u0026rsquove got to remember these things come and go very quickly, and in a couple of days we\u0026rsquoll forget about this, and the focus will be on the ministerial [team].  He suggested that if there had been better planning, the SNP could have headed off the media stories that followed the appointment.  Now global head of public affairs at Standard Life Aberdeen, Mr Aberdein said: \u0026ldquoHad that due diligence been done, then perhaps they might have been able to proactively, the SNP, deal with that, maybe spike it... as a political mechanism to see where the land lies beforehand, but of course that wasn\u0026rsquot done.  \u0026ldquoIt came as a surprise, and the result was there for all to see.  The U-turn on Ms Martin\u0026rsquos appointment means there will be no further and higher education minister until after the Holyrood recess, as MSPs must confirm the post.  However Ms Sturgeon could appoint a minister-designate over the summer, who could learn the brief in readiness for confirmation in September.

In 563 AD the Irish monk, St Columba set up a monastic community on the tiny isle of Iona.  Since then it has become a haven for pilgrims, welcoming some 1,500 guests to its Hebridean shores every year.  However recently the fate of the historical abbey precinct has been plunged into doubt after the Christian group based on the island said it has veered dangerously into disrepair.  The Iona Community has said that years of heavy use have taken their toll on the residential facilities at the island\u0027s abbey, with a recent survey revealing that \"without some urgent repairs and long-term major investment, they would be unfit for purpose within seven years\".    It is now launching a final push of its Iona Abbey Capital project to help raise the last \u0026pound500,000 by the end of this year.  On its completion, the project will deliver improved access, new bedrooms and fully accessible shower rooms and toilets, as well as improved insulation and washing facilities at the centrer.  Current \u0026lsquoprivate\u0026rsquo spaces in Iona Abbey will also become accessible to the public as part of the project.  Reverend Kathy Galloway, the joint leader of the Iona Community, said the group had now completed phase one of the works, and now needed more help to fully fund phase two.  She said: \"We want to adapt the living areas to be accessible for wheelchair users and people with mobility issues.  \"We also want to install a renewable energy heating system and winter proof the building so that we can extend our season to welcome more visitors and volunteers each year. At the moment, many rooms are too cold to use past October.\"    Iona Abbey in 1953  Already, \u0026pound3 million has been raised for the project, including \u0026pound300,000 in the month of May alone.  Working in partnership with Historic Environment Scotland and Iona Renewables, it also aims to provide a renewable energy heating system, through a progressive, community-led energy project.  The group said they are now in the position to begin phase two earlier than expected, which will lead to substantial savings, meaning the refurbished project will be ready to open a year early in 2020.  Reverend Galloway said: \"The Iona Community wants to continue to welcome people to share life in community for generations to come, and to make sure we are accessible for all.  \"This complex, exciting project will ensure people from around the world can continue to share in the community\u0026rsquos life within the historic setting and beauty of Iona,\" she said.  In 1938, the Reverend George MacLeod established the Iona Community in the docklands of Govan and on Iona in order to rebuild the monastic quarters of the medieval abbey.  Set in the context of the poverty of the Depression, he brought together unemployed skilled craftsmen and young trainee clergy to serve as a sign of hopeful rebuilding of community in urban Scotland, aiming to rebuild \"the common life by working and living together, sharing skills and effort as well as joys and achievement\".  This has shaped the practice and principles of the group, which acts as an ecumenical Christian community of men and women from different walks of life and different traditions in the Church engaged together.    Outside Iona Abbey in 1953  Since its completion in 1965, the monastery remains a centre for pilgrimage and tourism, with the community now running three residential centres on Iona and the nearby island of Mull.  Now, there is a year-round population of more than 100, including long-established island families as well as more recent arrivals, including those who work for the Iona Community in its centres as staff or volunteers.  Guests come to stay on the island to contemplate and pray, and play a significant role in the island\u0026rsquos economy.  Daily services of the Iona Community are undertaken in the Abbey church, with abbey itself managed by Historic Environment Scotland  Built of stone and slate, the buildings of the Iona Abbey Centre were originally the living quarters of the monks and have retained a distinctly monastic feel.  However, in a report sent to the Church of Scotland\u0026rsquos general assembly two years ago, the Iona Community said that \"piecemeal maintenance and sporadic upgrading of internal services, electrical, water, sewerage and heating have led to constant and uneconomic patchwork repairs.\"  As of this year, both the Abbey Centre and the MacLeod centre -- a newer building on the island, have been closed to residential guests.  Reverend Galloway said the group was hopeful that \"people in Scotland and beyond will recognise the great need to safeguard Iona Abbey as a living place of hospitality, and ensure that thousands more people can visit this special place seeking sanctuary and inspiration\".    The Refectory  In 563AD, the Irish monk Columba (Columkille) established a monastic settlement on the island of Iona, leading to large parts of Scotland and the north of England to become evangelised.  As an important centre of European Christianity, it became the site of a Benedictine abbey in the Middle Ages and for centuries it has attracted thousands of people on their own pilgrim journeys.  The Abbey also has a substantial collection of stone crosses which date back to within 200 years of its founding, some of which show Celtic influences thought to come from Ireland.  The carved stones include St John\u0027s Cross and St Oran\u0027s Cross, and a cross slab created 100 years later.  The crosses are thought to be among the finest examples of such sculpture to survive.  Others bear the stamp of the Vikings who first raided Iona in 794 AD."},{"url":null,"title":"learner-drivers-should-have-to-spot-potholes-to-pass-test","story":"              Learner drivers should have to prove they can spot potholes to pass the test, according to a motoring firm.  The AA wants poor road surfaces to be included in the hazard perception test because of the damage they cause to vehicles.  It also called for advice on what to do when drivers encounter a pothole to be added to the Highway Code.  One in five local roads in England and Wales is in a poor condition as councils face a huge funding deficit to tackle potholes, a recent report by the Asphalt Industry Alliance warned.  Hazard perception is part of the theory driving test and involves candidates identifying something that would cause them to take action such as slow down or change direction in 14 video clips.  The pass rate of the practical driving test fell to a nine-year low of 45% after changes to make the exam more realistic were introduced in December last year.  The AA advises motorists who spot a pothole to:  - Slow down if necessary but keep an eye on the rear view mirror  - Stay in lane  - Avoid big swerves  A survey of a small sample of driving instructors found that the majority have broken down during a lesson at least once in the past 12 months because of pothole-related damage, and many have to adapt lessons to avoid certain roads where there are too many potholes.  Some learners have even had to abandon a practical driving test because their car was damaged by a pothole, the AA was told.  Damage to tyres, wheels and suspension are the most common problems.  AA president Edmund King said: \"It is a sad indictment of our poor road conditions that instructors are having to adapt their lessons to avoid potholed roads.  \"More troubling is the fact that lessons and tests are being abandoned because of pothole related breakdowns.  \"This is damaging to learners\u0027 confidence and to instructors whose livelihoods depend on having a fit-for-purpose road network and an undamaged car.  \"The situation is so serious that the hazard perception test and Highway Code need to change to reflect the state of the roads that learner drivers have to learn on.  \"There is no advice for drivers about potholes anywhere in the Highway Code yet it is one of the most common hazards they encounter.\"  Drivers are being urged to photograph potholes and send them to the responsible highway authority and the Department for Transport to demonstrate the scale of the issue as part of the AA\u0027s #FlagitFunditFillit campaign.  The Government said the DVSA keeps the driving test under constant review to make it as effective as possible.  It said in a statement: \"We have listened to the concerns of road users and are already providing councils in England with over \u0026pound6 billion to help improve the condition of our local highways.  \"This funding includes a record \u0026pound296 million through the Pothole Action Fund - enough to fix around six million potholes.\""},{"url":null,"title":"uk-business-secretary-hints-brexit-transition-period-could-be-extended-beyond-2020","story":"              THE Business Secretary has added to the tensions inside Theresa May\u0026rsquos divided cabinet by suggesting the post-Brexit transition may have to be extended.  Greg Clark said the status-quo period, which is due to end in December 2020, some 21 months after the UK formally leaves the EU, should be set by \u0026ldquofacts and evidence.  He suggested new computer systems and other border controls might not be ready by 2020.  On Ridge on Sunday on Sky News, Mr Clark, who has said practical business concerns must come before ideology on Brexit, refused to rule out an extension.  He said: \"At all times we need to be guided by the evidence on this. Speaking to the people that run [the port of Dover and Eurotunnel]... there are things that would need to be put in place, computer systems for example posts at the border, even if they checked, automatically number plates.  \"What we need assess is how long it would reasonably take to put in practice. It seems to me that any reasonable person would have to be guided by the facts and the evidence.  His comments were echoed by Andrea Leadsom, who said 2020 was \u0026ldquonot a magical date.  The leader of the Commons said 2020 \u0026ldquoshould be long enough but \u0026ldquoremains under review.  She told told HuffPost UK: \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos been agreed is the end of December 2020. And it\u0026rsquos not a magical figure, a magical date. It\u0026rsquos just what has been agreed with the EU.  \u0026ldquoI personally think it should be long enough. That\u0026rsquos my view. It\u0026rsquos fine as it is. We don\u0026rsquot need for any particular reason to extend it.  \u0026ldquoBut I think it remains under review. As all sides make very clear, nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.  The idea of extending the period the UK in which maintains much of its relationship with the EU, while losing influence in Brussels, is an incendiary one for Brexiters, who fear it would postpone new trade deals and prolong freedom of movement, creating \u0026lsquoBrino\u0026rsquo, or Brexit in name only.  It is also likely to worsen the break-down in cabinet discipline ahead of this Friday\u0026rsquos crunch meeting at Chequers, where Mrs May hopes to finalise the UK blueprint for Brexit.  Brexiteers oppose the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos favoured option of a customs partnership with the EU, which would see the UK collect tariffs set by the EU customs union on goods entering the country on behalf of the bloc.  However both options have been dismissed by the EU.  It emerged at the weekend that Brexiter Environment Secretary Michael Gove had physically ripped up an official report suggesting he had come round to the customers partnership plan.  Asked if the customs partnership option was still on the table, Mr Clark said: \"Yes.\"  The chair of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, Sir Graham Brady, publicly pleaded for government unity.  Writing in the Observer, he said his party risked looking divided and letting in Labour.  He said: \u0026ldquoElectorates these days are volatile, but one thing is certain: they do not vote for divided parties. They rejected decisively the divided Tory party in 1997.  \u0026ldquoIf we were to let Labour in again, it would be a disaster for this country.  Damian Green, Mrs May\u0026rsquos former deputy, also attacked the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos fractious cabinet.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have seen threats against her, attacks on business, and cabinet ministers taking the proverbial out of each other\u0026rsquos policies. All of this in full public gaze. It has been an unedifying spectacle of oversized egos showing they are not fit to be officers.  Housing minister James Brokenshire admitted there were \u0026ldquostrong views on either side of the cabinet over Brexit, but he remained confident the Friday meeting at Chequers would end with a \u0026ldquoclear direction and a white paper published the week after.  There are now effectively only six weeks of negotiating time before the UK is supposed to agree a final deal on trade and other aspects of Brexit with the other 27 EU countries.  On Sky News, Jeremy Corbyn said he would be content with a longer transition period  Asked if he would accept it going past 2020, the Labour leader said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove got a feeling it might go beyond that\u0026hellip Yes."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8006151.jpg?type=article-full","title":"music-lovers-feel-the-heat-as-big-acts-turn-up-the-volume","story":"              Thousands of revellers soaked up the sunshine over the weekend as Glasgow played host to some of the biggest names in music.

A CT scan at the University of Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies revealed the screw in her stomach and vets quickly removed it with the help of a miniature camera.  Vet Dr Bronwyn Koterwas, of the Exotic Animal and Wildlife Medicine and Surgery service at the university, said: \u0026ldquoElvis was very poorly when she came to us.  \u0026ldquoThanks to our advanced scanning equipment and dedicated team of experts working across departments we were able to rapidly spot what was wrong.  \u0026ldquoWe are delighted that Elvis has left the building and has returned safely to Blair Drummond.

Sheila Walker, Animal Collection Manager at Blair Drummond, said: \u0026ldquoIt is imperative that when any of our animals are sick that they are seen by vets with expertise and the experience necessary to treat the species and we are very fortunate that the Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies is only a short drive away.  \u0026ldquoElvis does a short walk from her aviary to the presentation ground and we think that is where she possibly picked up the screw.  \u0026ldquoOur keepers now do a quick sweep of the track before bringing her out."},{"url":null,"title":"italian-league-leader-eu-election-to-be-referendum-on-migration","story":"              The leader of the right-wing party in Italy\u0026rsquos populist government has told tens of thousands of supporters he wants to turn next year\u0026rsquos European Parliament election into a referendum on immigration and job security.  Italian interior minister Matteo Salvini also told his League party\u0026rsquos annual gathering of a vision of uniting the political movements in several European countries which say they want to prevent national interests from being eclipsed by European Union agendas.  Mr Salvini said at the event held in sweltering heat in Pontida, northern Italy: \u0026ldquoI am thinking of a League of Leagues that will put together all the free, sovereign movements.  The League leader enjoys a rapport with French far-right leader Marine Le Pen and former Ukip leader Nigel Farage.  He said the 2019 election for the EU\u0026rsquos legislature should be tantamount to a \u0026ldquoreferendum between the elite, the banks, finance, immigration and job security and the Europe of the peoples and of work.  The League has long railed against EU strictures on national spending and has expressed scepticism about whether it is worth it for Italy to remain in the eurozone.  \u0026ldquoThe happiness of the people comes first, Mr Salvini proclaimed, drawing rousing cheers from League rank-and-file.  He asked supporters if they would \u0026ldquoswear, yes or no, to liberate the people from this Europe.  \u0026ldquoYes, came the resounding reply from the crowd.  Since taking office in Italy\u0026rsquos month-old coalition government, Mr Salvini has made good on a campaign pledge to crack down on humanitarian groups that rescue migrants from smugglers\u0026rsquo boats in the Mediterranean Sea and then ferry the asylum-seekers to Italian ports.  Several hundred thousand rescued passengers, many of them economic migrants ineligible for asylum, have flooded Italy in the last few years.  Mr Salvini announced on Saturday that Italy is refusing to allow a rescue ship to dock in an Italian port, the third such denial in three weeks.  Spain stepped in to offer safe harbour, and the vessel operated by Spanish aid group Proactiva Open Arms is headed to Barcelona.  Mr Salvini told the rally: \u0026ldquoToday, there\u0026rsquos a third ship that will head to another country, and there will also be a fourth and a fifth and so on.  He reiterated his stance that \u0026ldquothe doors of Italy will be wide open for women and children who flee war, but \u0026ldquofor the others, no.  The League is junior partner in the coalition government with the anti-EU 5-Star Movement. In the weeks since, League candidates have triumphed in a series of mayoral elections, sometimes at the expense of the 5-Stars.  A survey of eligible voters published in Saturday\u0026rsquos Corriere della Sera newspaper found support for the League polling at 31.2%, compared to the Movement\u0026rsquos 29.8%.  A prominent 5-Star figure, Roberto Fico, who is president of the Italian parliament\u0026rsquos lower Chamber, has opposed Mr Salvini\u0026rsquos policy of denying safe harbour to humanitarian rescue boats.  Mr Salvini said that was Mr Fico\u0026rsquos personal opinion. Similarly dismissing any talk of a coalition rift was 5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio, who, like Mr Salvini, serves as deputy premier.  The League has been transformed from from a north-based regional movement into a national force, attracting anti-migrant voters in the south, a region the party once denigrated as an unproductive drain on national coffers."},{"url":null,"title":"cheryl-and-liam-payne-announce-split","story":"              Cheryl and Liam Payne have split up after a two-and-a-half-year relationship.

Immature eggs have been shown for the first time in a laboratory to survive on ovarian tissue which was removed from cancer patients before treatment and stripped of cells, researchers said.  It is hoped this engineered structure could be re-implanted into women and restore fertility after they have completed chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Scientists from the Rigshospitalet, in Copenhagen, Denmark, proved the graft worked when using human tissue transplanted into mice.  Experts said the research, presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) annual meeting in Barcelona, \u0026ldquoholds much promise for the future.  Many cancer treatments can damage the ovaries, stopping the body from producing eggs and meaning a woman cannot get pregnant. Women dealing with a diagnosis can choose to have their eggs frozen, while some doctors may offer to remove or freeze all or part of an ovary so it can be transplanted back after treatment.  However, there is a small chance that grafted ovarian tissue could reintroduce cancer cells.  A \u0026ldquobio-engineered ovary would reduce this risk, the research team from Rigshospitalet said.  Their experiments used ovarian tissue removed from women trying to preserve their fertility before cancer treatment. The cells from the tissue were eliminated using chemicals, leaving behind a \u0026ldquobio-engineered scaffold on which the early-stage egg-containing follicles were reseeded.  Dr Susanne Pors, who presented the research, said: \u0026ldquoThis is the first time that isolated human follicles have survived in a decellularised human scaffold and, as a proof-of-concept, it could offer a new strategy in fertility preservation without risk of malignant cell recurrence.  Experiments in which the structure was transplanted into mice showed it could support the survival and growth of the follicles.  Commenting on the research, Professor Nick Macklon, medical director at London Women\u0026rsquos Clinic, said it was an \u0026ldquoexciting development.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove been able to show that they can then introduce back into that tissue stored follicles and early-growth eggs, that then appear to grow in that material that\u0026rsquos had all the cells removed, he said.  \u0026ldquoAnd, that this can then be placed back into the body and hopefully allow women to re-establish their cycles to possibly conceive, either naturally or with IVF, while reducing this risk of cancer.  He said the technique was \u0026ldquolikely to develop into something that will be potentially useful, but said further research was needed to prove it will work in humans.  Stuart Lavery, consultant gynaecologist at Hammersmith Hospital, said \u0026ldquoIf this is shown to be effective, it offers huge advantages over IVF and egg freezing."},{"url":null,"title":"loki-and-heseltine-to-headline-festival-of-politics","story":"              THE rapper Loki is to appear at this year\u0026rsquos Festival of Politics at the Scottish Parliament.

Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing.

Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

Universal Credit is simplifying the system and revolutionising welfare by making work pay. It also helps those who are in work to increase their hours and earnings.                                                     Universal Credit replaces six benefits with one monthly payment and is already being claimed by single jobseekers. And from today, people who would previously have made a claim to Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income support, Working and Child Tax Credit and Housing Benefit will instead claim Universal Credit.        A £1.5bn package of improvements making it easier for people moving onto Universal Credit was announced in the Budget. People applying to Universal Credit can now receive a 100% advance on their first payment and the 7-day waiting period for new claimants was removed earlier this year. Among other improvements, from April 2018 the Government also continues to pay Housing Benefit claimants’ rent for two weeks - which is non-recoverable - when moving onto Universal Credit.Minister for Employment Alok Sharma said: “Universal Credit is central to our commitment to help families improve their lives by moving into work. We know it’s working – with Universal Credit people are moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system. “And now we are rolling it out to a wider range of people in a safe and controlled way. From today, more people, including families and disabled people, can claim Universal Credit and access the extra help it provides.”Single jobseekers are already receiving support from their dedicated work coach to find employment or increase their hours and earnings. Now, all types of claimants will be able to benefit from the improved, personalised, one-to-one support that Universal Credit offers.                                                                                                        Carol Sadler, from Jobcentre Plus said: “Universal Credit offers tailored support, which includes more personalised help from a work coach. The new system is also more flexible, which means people can take on short-term work to develop their skills and build up their experience. “Our staff are trained to support people throughout the claim process. We’d encourage anyone who needs extra help or information to come and talk to their work coach.”Those on Universal Credit will now have 24-hour access to an online account that they can use to manage their claim, including reporting changes of circumstances, checking the details of their claim and date of their next Universal Credit payment. With the application process now completely online, Universal Credit streamlines the system, making benefits simpler to navigate and easier to understand.

It is the right product at the right time.The Statoil order will include pipeline bundles and control umbilicals required for the development.The Snorre field is sited within the Tampen area of the Norwegian North Sea.Since the last pipeline was launched in Caithness in March last year, the company has refurbished the rail track which is used to transport the bundles to the sea and on to the tugs before being taken to their destination.Monday 2 Jul 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116349.jpg","title":"Technical issues force delay to new Pulteney post office service","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe long-established Pulteneytown Post Office in Smith Terrace closed its doors for the last time on Thursday.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Monday 2 Jul 2018 10:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

His first order of priority, however, must be the unfinished business of implementing cheaper ferry fares on ferry routes serving Orkney and Shetland.“Having already waited a decade since the government first introduced RET on west coast routes, people in the Northern Isles should not have to wait any longer.“The First Minister promised RET in the first half of 2018. That means Michael Matheson must deliver before parliament rises for the summer recess at the end of this week.”Mr Halcro Johnston says that the Northern Isles have been left in limbo by the RET uncertainties, adding that he has written to Mr Matheson in a bid to see the RET commitment delivered.He said: “The new transport secretary has just days to implement RET for ferry fares to Orkney and Shetland, in line with commitment made by his predecessor and after years of promises from the SNP.“The constant delays we have seen regarding RET have caused real uncertainty in the Northern Isles and have left residents and visitors unable to plan journeys knowing what the eventual costs will be.\u0026#8221\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All we are now waiting for is confirmation that it’s fully legal and then we can get on with implementing it. Our lawyers have told us that because we are a commercial operation and currently receive no subsidy whatsoever, we have to be 100 per cent sure that this scheme complies otherwise our whole business is at risk. We are not sure why it is taking so long to get simple confirmation.“Although not one penny of the proposed subsidy comes to us, it goes directly to the passenger, we would be forced to pay it all back if it doesn’t comply, that could ruin us and we can’t take that risk. All we are asking for is for the Scottish Government to check that it’s legal with the EU and UK and then we can get on with it. We have written to the new Minister Michael Matheson MSP and invited him to visit the island and meet our staff so we can share our concerns with him directly and hopefully he will visit soon so we can get this unlocked.“We have also today asked for a meeting with our local MSP Liam McArthur to see if he can do anything to get things moving forward on our behalf. This is extremely frustrating but as a family run, fully commercial Orcadian business, employing 70 people and with exciting expansion plans, we cannot put at risk our business until we are certain the Scottish Government’s proposal fully comply.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It also found that 62 per cent of posts are in professional occupations.Eilean Siar, Glasgow and Highland are the three areas with the highest number of jobs in which Gaelic is considered essential, together accounting for 93 per cent of the Scottish total.The study was welcomed by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney, who commented that the growth in desirable and essential jobs making use of Gaelic language would provide young people with a wealth of exciting career choices.\"I hope that this report will encourage more people to consider learning Gaelic,\" he added.As well as looking at the demand for Gaelic language skills, the report looks at Gaelic education, analyses the opportunities and challenges, and suggests future action.Damien Yeates, chief Executive of SDS, said: \"Developing a detailed evidence base of current and future skills demand is essential for all parts of our economy, and the Gaelic language labour market is no exception.\"Last year SDS published the second edition of its Gaelic language plan, and this study was one of the key commitments contained in that plan.\"The evidence will help inform future investment aimed at promoting the Gaelic language and culture.\"Shona MacLennan, chief executive of B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig, commented: \"B\u0026ograverd na G\u0026agraveidhlig is clear that growing the number of Gaelic-essential jobs and jobs which use Gaelic is important in ensuring that Gaelic is used more often, by more people and in a wider range of situations.\"The key challenge is to ensure that the flow of people with high quality Gaelic language skills entering the labour market is matched to the demand from employers across the public, private and third sectors, and from across Scotland.\"\u0026nbspFuture actions proposed in the report include forming a national group with responsibility for Gaelic language skills, and increased monitoring and evaluation of the activities supporting the language.Charlotte Wright, Chief Executive of Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), said: \"Gaelic is fundamental to HIE\u0026rsquos unique remit which integrates economic and community development throughout the Highlands and Islands.\"Our support has helped numerous organisations which enable Gaelic to flourish, and we look forward to continuing to work with businesses, social enterprises and community organisations that can add value through using Gaelic to help realise its full potential.\"Monday 2 Jul 2018 10:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Most damaging of all, Loganair noted, was the announcement by Flybe that it was entering a new franchise agreement with Eastern Airways and would compete head-to-head on six routes.            Despite the turbulence, Loganair booked record turnover of £110.7m, a rise of 7 per cent. Passenger numbers were up 6.2 per cent to an all-time high of 812,541, but the load factor – the percentage of seats filled on scheduled flights – fell from 62.8 per cent to 59.8 per cent, due to the overcapacity on routes with Flybe competition. Just under 78 per cent of flights ran on time.Chairman David Harrison said: “This year’s results bring to an end 17 consecutive years in profit for Loganair, and the fact that we forecast last year that we would be loss-making in 2017/18 makes it no less painful.“The extent of the loss is a direct result of competition on six of our eight largest routes, and from the outset we maintained that the markets on these routes were simply not big enough to sustain the level of seat capacity being introduced. This indeed proved to the case.“However, these costs are non-recurring, and Loganair is now on the front foot and ready for a successful year ahead.”Managing director Jonathan Hinkles added: “In a challenging year, I’m delighted to say that the transition from franchise partner to an airline operating in its own right was completed on schedule.            “In the last 12 months we have transformed our operation with wholesale changes to our reservations, revenue accounting and check-in systems.“We have carried out a full rebrand, repainted our aircraft in tartan livery, introduced new crew and ground staff uniform, brought in a comprehensive system of service improvements for our customers and launched a significant sales and marketing programme.“I’m equally pleased to be able to report that the response from our customers to these developments has been extremely positive.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762286.1530442869!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures liam gallagher closes day 2 of trnsmt festival","story":"\t\tTens of thousands of music lovers once again flocked to a sold out Glasgow Green for day two of Scotland\u0026#8217s biggest music festival, and as TRNSMT fans bathed in glorious temperatures - with Glasgow reaching higher temperatures than Madrid \u0026#8211 acts like Gerry Cinnamon, Kyle Falconer, Courteeners and Krept and Konan took to the stage.\t\t\t\t• VIEW THE FULL GALLERY HERE            Kicking things off on the Main Stage were Glasgow’s very own The LaFontaines with frontman Kerr Okan delighting the crowd as the band made their second consecutive appearance at the festival.

Thanks for watching us, you are part of this band!”Shed Seven followed with hits including ‘Disco Down’ and ‘Going for Gold’ as well as a cover of Stone Roses ‘I Am the Resurrection’ Krept x Konan, the London-based hip-hop duo who have seen a gradual rise to prominence over the last few years, took to the stage before the arrival  of possibly the most anticipated performance of TRNSMT’s first weekend - Gerry Cinnamon’s Main Stage set. Just one year ago the local star took to the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage, now a year later thousands of fans displayed their adoration for the one man show with just an acoustic guitar the singer-songwriter from Castlemilk once again had the crowd eating out of his hands.             Fans over on the King Tut’s Powered by Utilita Stage were also treated to a strong line-up of both promising and established acts throughout the day, including openers The Night Café, BAS, The Academic, Scottish natives The Snuts and Kyle Falconer, who provided an insight into his upcoming solo album. Ramz and IAMDDB continued the party into the early evening, before The Sherlocks closed proceedings with their straight-down-the-line indie sound.As the evening rocked on, Wolf Alice’s performed hits such as ‘Silk’ and newer material including ‘Don’t Delete the Kisses’, before the Courteeners took the Main Stage.Ten years on from the release of their, now iconic, debut album St Jude, Courteeners wowed their fans with tunes like ‘Not Nineteen Forever’, ‘Notion’ and ‘Cavorting’.            Headline act Liam Gallagher then arrived stating: “So this is the famous Glasgow Green then? I’ve heard a lot about it.” The former Oasis frontman’s performance then documented his 25-year career as one of the country’s most popular figures, with solo tunes such as ‘Wall of Glass’ and ‘Greedy Soul’ tucked between Oasis classics such as ‘Morning Glory’ and ‘Wonderwall’.Geoff Ellis, Festival Director said: “Today has had so many highlights from the mass Shed Seven singalong to the absolute class of Liam Gallagher’s set. One of the biggest moments for me was watching local boy Gerry Cinnamon completely command the Main Stage in front of his biggest ever crowd. This felt like a real tipping point performance that people will be talking about for years to come.

I am a unionist with a lower case “u”.             By that I mean I am not committed to any one unionist party and am willing to give non-unionist parties a fair hearing if they apply liberal, low tax, small government policies in Scotland, because I believe these are what will most likely deliver as harmonious and prosperous a Scotland for the vast majority of its people as is practicably possible.            Nor do I support unionism because I think an independent Scotland could not succeed one just has to look at other smaller countries to see that if Denmark or Norway can do well then surely so could Scotland – if it lived within its means.No, I am unionist because I am at home with being Scottish and British. It was in my mother’s milk that I suckled on it was in my rearing through infancy and schooldays and my travelling around the UK as a youth and then an undergraduate. I have rejoiced in our rich and diverse cultural history during my British holidays, just as I enjoy the internal home nations’ rivalries or competition between Scotland’s cities or the Highlands and Lowlands. I can see the good in them and the faults in them, but I do see and feel a tangible unifying oneness, a bond that I cannot let go of.So when I see the bitter divisions that came out of the first independence referendum – the splitting of families, the loss of friends and the rising tide of implied or discreet threats, sometimes with genuine menace – then I fear what another independence referendum could do to our country. At the age of 60 this year, I do not think the psychological wounds of 2014 will be healed before I leave this Earth – were there to be a second referendum then I have absolutely no doubt it will be ugly and the scarring divisions that much greater. Yet I have to tell you I also believe there will be another and it will not be pretty, and whatever the outcome it will need real leadership to bring about a healing. Sadly, there are few leaders of any humility or calibre that I think could achieve such a highly desirable role.I believe there will be another independence referendum because all the signs point to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wishing and now needing it to be so, and for good or ill she will instigate it.             The original SNP strategy was that if, when in government, it could show a SNP-run Scotland was no worse or maybe even slightly better than the Labour-Liberal Democrat administrations before, then independence might not seem such an undesirable leap. On many issues this meant the SNP actually did very little it promised for instance, the council tax was not abolished in favour of a local income tax, nor were students loans written off.When in 2011 the SNP won its overall majority it still did not seek to frighten the horses for fear of losing potential supporters for independence. Other than centralising institutions (under the mistaken guise of saving money), public service reform was studiously avoided. Scotland was in stasis while the independence White Paper, Scotland’s Future, was published, and following the 55-45 defeat no ­serious public service reform has followed.The SNP is essentially averse to challenging the vested interests in health and education, for to do so must force some people to be against them when they need to build a coalition for Yes (or more likely “Leave”) the second time round.After 11 years of SNP government we are therefore at a point where, under its watch, education is much worse with falling numeracy and literacy and collapsing international rankings expose the truth of this the Scottish NHS too is failing with the worst cancer treatment times in history and four health boards now requiring emergency loans totalling over £70 million just to get by meanwhile the iconic Queensferry Crossing yet again requires further remedial work that will disrupt traffic all summer and our public roads now have more craters than the surface of the Moon.             These are just some examples, for when you turn over any Scottish Government stone the problems come crawling out like clipshears and wood lice.Last week Sturgeon had a shambolic ministerial reshuffle that was bad on two counts. Firstly, she appointed a narcissist tweeter with a criminal conviction as Justice Secretary, when the role requires a solemn and judicious politician with a character, like Caesar’s wife, that is beyond suspicion. Secondly she not only retained her financial secretary, Derek Mackay, who has presided over a growing black hole that no quantum physicist can explain, she actually added to his brief. Ultimately this void will swallow up her government. Then she retained her Education Secretary, John Swinney, when by the evidence of his own inactions he has utterly failed to deliver the necessary reforms for what is claimed to be her “number one priority” of schooling.That was before the wheels came of the reshuffle tea trolley with the withdrawal of Gillian Martin as education minister.             The strategy for a second independence referendum was originally to use any and every grievance with Westminster – and where none existed, to create some – so momentum for a referendum could then be held. That is clearly not working. Nor by 20,000 leagues is the original model of demonstrating competence.All that is now left is for Sturgeon to take us into a second referendum – with or without Westminster’s necessary legal consent – so she can polarise the country and thus galvanise personal support to have any chance of the SNP remaining the largest party after the next Holyrood elections in 2021.Glorious victory – or more likely, glorious defeat whatever the cost to Scotland – is worth it if it means remaining in control of government. No longer is a second referendum about winning independence, it is about retaining power. Scotland will be thrown to the wolves to whip up division so in the aftermath disappointed supporters will flock to the SNP. Sturgeon cares not for the country’s harmony, prosperity or public services – she cares only for the SNP being in position to have a third tilt at independence.Such is the sorry state of our nation. I hope and pray I am wrong.• Brian Monteith is editor of ThinkScotland.org"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4762404.1530479246!/image/image.jpg","title":"lesley riddoch snp need to solve highlands housing shortage","story":"\t\tThis summer will be one of the best ever for Scotland\u0026#8217s tourist industry. The weakness of the pre-Brexit pound, the trend for staycationing, the discovery of home-grown treasures like the North Coast 500 and weeks of heatwave weather mean foreign and English tourists have been joined by Scots deciding to holiday at home.    \t\t\t\tBut while tourism will undoubtedly hit new heights in 2018, it may also finally expose the housing crisis in remote and rural Scotland, which affects every facet of life and means locals cannot benefit as they should from this seasonal windfall.            Alison Macleod has been community development officer on the Applecross Peninsula for seven years. She and her fisherman husband Alasdair had lived there for 35 years until his tragic death late last year. Now, for lots of reasons, she plans to leave. Obviously, there are personal issues. But there’s also the fact that for long wearying decades the tiny community has been banging its collective head off the brick wall of the Applecross Trust – the landowner which owns most of the 60,000 acres on the peninsula.             Despite a succession of schemes, pleas and campaigns, next to no land has been made available for any kind of community development, including affordable houses. The cost of accommodation has risen rapidly over the last 15 years because of scarcity and the demand for holiday houses. Local people – often dependent on seasonal tourism-related jobs – struggle to get mortgages and cannot compete. Without houses, busy local businesses struggle to recruit and retain staff. Anyone who wants to live on the peninsula must live in a caravan all year round or in shared hotel staff accommodation.  The situation is hardly any better than when Alison took up the job. Despite the vast emptiness of Applecross, there is no land for housing. It’s a disgrace. Thanks to a herculean effort, the community energy scheme, Apple Juice, did squeak home just before the UK government cut meaningful subsidies. At least that will attract a worthwhile income to the community – over time. But right now, tourism is placing an extra burden on the doughty DIY community. Instead of devoting all their energies to finding the land to build affordable homes, the volunteers who staff the Applecross Community Company must spend their precious time catering for the near-constant avalanche of tourists. Effectively, the community of 200 people must clean, maintain and run toilet facilities, also used by dozens of camper vans and caravans to empty waste. Highland Council has withdrawn most of the cash for toilet facilities and there is no properly organised place to dispose of caravan waste locally. Alison says: “Our local tourist businesses will always welcome visitors to Applecross and make sure they enjoy their time here. We know our local economy is dependent on tourism but our infrastructure needs a lot of investment to cope and we cannot be expected to do it all ourselves. The powers that be expect volunteers to put in an enormous amount of time and effort to ensure communities are sustainable, but there is a limit to what can be done voluntarily with fewer than 200 adults, no matter how able and determined. The result is volunteer burnout and disillusion, not community empowerment.”Now this may be where the urban majority shrugs, turns over the page or tunes out. I’ve no doubt that, from a city perspective, country folk seem stubbornly unwilling to recognise the facts of life. Of course housing, roads, broadband and basic facilities are poor in the Highlands – that’s what happens when you don’t live in a city. On Radio Scotland last week, a report about the NHS at 70 highlighted the drastic shortage of doctors, nurses, surgeons and GPs in rural Scotland. The reporter suggested this was inevitable because young people wanting to specialise don’t have a large or wide enough caseload in small towns or rural areas. That may be a problem for some. But for many NHS staff, keen to live a more sustainable life in beautiful surroundings, the problem is far simpler: no housing, no land for housing and no expectation that modest housing schemes will get through planning. It’s the same story across the Highlands. Rural Scotland is not a basket case destined for unavoidable decline. But resourceful Highland, island and rural folk have their hands tied behind their backs when it comes to building the infrastructure that supports life.             According to Argyll builder and former MSP Mike Mackenzie: “There are struggling farmers and crofters aplenty who would happily turn a corner of a field into a high-quality camper van site. Visual impact might be easily mitigated by dry stane dykes and a few native trees. Decent laybys at appropriate intervals could relieve many of the road problems without turning single-track roads into motorways. With less than 2 per cent of the Highlands under development, we have land aplenty. The reluctance embodied in the planning system to use this resource is simply perverse.”The Highlands’ chronic housing shortage is also making schools become unviable – in Argyll and Bute, the 26 village and island schools saved ten years ago may soon close because of falling rolls. Local youngsters, about to start families, are the most desperate. Four years ago a group of young adults  in Aviemore planned to club together, buy a field and hope they would win planning permission to build houses co-operatively using sweat labour to make it affordable. But despite expert help, nothing happened and most have left the area and some even the country. This haemorrhaging has to stop.  What’s the big problem? Some suggest housing associations seek economies of scale and opt to build blocks of 50 houses in urban areas rather than five to ten houses in rural areas. Others suggest the process is bureaucratic, cumbersome and so slow that the demand for housing has generally fled long before the houses are ready. Community houses built near Ulva took almost ten years to complete. There are very few people who can maintain their energy, enthusiasm and patience over this kind of timescale. Funding evaporates and any vestige of entrepreneurial spirit withers away.            The situation demands urgent action – the Planning Bill currently before Holyrood offers a vehicle for bold solutions. Let’s not continue the pretence one summer longer. Extra tourists alone cannot save rural Scotland.

But an MSP wants Souness, 65, to abandon the multi-­million-pound project after the company submitted plans to build 2,600 homes on the sprawling site.            In a letter to the former Ibrox boss, Scottish Conservative MSP Graham Simpson said: “I urge you to reconsider destroying this protected piece of green space.”Campaign group Save Woodhall and Faskine said the development will ruin “irreplaceable” countryside, harm wildlife and cause pollution.But Mr Simpson also believes preserving the site is important for the health of local residents.In his letter to Souness, Mr Simpson adds: “You will be aware of the site and its importance both environmentally and culturally.“What you may not be so aware of is its significance to the local community and their health and wellbeing.            “However, as a former sportsman I am certain that people’s physical and mental health are at the forefront of your thoughts.“Scottish Government figures show that in 2016, 65 per cent of adults over the age of 16 were overweight and 29 per cent were obese. “I am sure you would agree that these are shocking statistics. The value of green space to people’s health and wellbeing is well-documented.“Unfortunately, if this application gets approval we will be losing open space and woodland.”            Souness’s son Fraser Souness, 37, and Scott Gillespie, 44, are directors of Orchard Brae Ltd which has applied to build on the land between the villages of Carnbroe and ­Calderbank.Their company – 40.5 per cent owned by the Souness family – lodged its application with North Lanarkshire Council last month. The company previously received a loan from a company owned by Scotland’s richest woman Ann Gloag. The land is owned by two daughters of former Conservative home secretary Willie Whitelaw.The plans also include shops, educational and leisure facilities, restaurants, a pub, a garden centre and a hotel.A 3,000-signature petition opposing development was presented to Holyrood in March when Mr Simpson led a debate calling for the greenbelt to be saved.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"health board in talks for better airport waiting area in aberdeen ","story":"NHS Shetland has been in talks to look at an alternative waiting area for patients flying back from Aberdeen Airport – rather than what has been described by a councillor as \u0026#8220a drafty corridor\u0026#8221.\nHealth board chief executive Ralph Roberts raised the issue during a Zetland Transport Partnership meeting on Tuesday afternoon.\nMr Roberts said there had been discussions with Loganair to look an alternative and he was having more talks about the matter on Friday.\nHe said there had been a suggestion that NHS Shetland should be obliged to pay for a lounge for passengers, but added in his own view it was a matter for all passengers travelling to Shetland.\nMr Roberts argued if the waiting area were adequate for all passengers it would be adequate for patients too.\nZetTrans chairman Ryan Thomson thanked Mr Roberts for bringing it to members\u0026#8217 attention.\nMr Thomson added \u0026#8220it\u0026#8217s a drafty corridor\u0026#8221, the issue had been raised at other transport meetings and Loganair was aware of the issue.\n\n \u0026raquo\nYet again, this is just so typical.  When are NHS Shetland going to ask patients what they want?  Do I want to be separated and singled out as an NHS patient travelling?  No, I don\u0026#8217t.\nAll airports are draughty to an extent (so is the Gilbert Bain Hospital, for that matter, in places).  I can\u0026#8217t see Loganair paying to be on a premium gate.\nAre NHS Shetland also going to be in discussions regarding draughty Sumburgh Airport then?\nPerhaps if NHS Shetland staff have so much time on their hands to discuss matters such as this, they could give Patient Travel a hand so they can re-open to the public on Thursday afternoons.\nI just wanted to make it clear that progressing this discussion is in fact in response to numerous comments we have received from patients who have provided feedback about the inadequacy of facilities at Aberdeen airport. As is perfectly right we have therefore responded to this by looking at how we can respond to these concerns.\nIf this does result in improved facilities for our patients then obviously any individual who doesn’t want to use them would be perfectly entitled to make that choice.\n@ Ralph Roberts \u0026#8211 Thank you for that insight, it\u0026#8217s a shame it wasn\u0026#8217t mentioned in the original press report here as it came across (to me) that you were responding only to a councillor.  However, I can\u0026#8217t help but wonder if someone can\u0026#8217t cope with the facilities available at Aberdeen, whether they should have been (in certain circumstances) discharged from the hospital in the first place.  Of course, if NHS Shetland had argued over the years for improved hospital facilities here, we wouldn\u0026#8217t have such a need to travel to the mainland.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"6 herrisdale park tingwal ","story":"Offers over £145,000\n nursery.\nIn addition to the two double bedrooms, the accommodation includes a single bedroom, dining kitchen, livingroom, shower room and separate toilet.
