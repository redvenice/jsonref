I\u0027m very happy that such an important person is using my blanket because it means there will be more orders for the company and continued work for us.\u0027Mrs Regar lives in a decrepit, half-built brick house on the outskirts of Bagru, an area which specialises in textile hand printing. She shares it with her husband, two sons, their wives and two grandchildren. It cost £7,000 to build but there was not enough money to complete construction. The family of eight live in two rooms, which are poorly lit due to intermittent electricity while there is also a limited water supply. A hole in the ground passes for a toilet while the bathroom is composed of a bucket and tap. The half-paved roads surrounding their home have been flooded lately due to the monsoon while pigs and cows rummage through rubbish searching for food.Meghan and Prince Harry, who pride themselves on their social activism and philanthropy, will be disturbed to learn of the pay and living conditions of those who made Archie\u0027s organic blanket. It has also been reported that the couple, who have championed a number of green initiatives to help save the planet, are keen to raise their son in an eco-conscious way.         Staff at the factory said they were delighted that Meghan and Harry (pictured) had chosen the Malabar Baby Indian blanket to cradle baby Archie because it resulted in 2,000 more orders              The duchess was pictured with the £33 dohar which is sold by a Hong Kong based brand called Malabar Baby, which specialises in organic baby clothes and accessories for affluent mothersMrs Regar, who is affectionately known as Aruna Devi amongst her colleagues and friends, said: \u0027You can see how we live. It is a basic existence. We work all the hours that God sends because we have to.\u0027We do not understand things about saving the planet or what is or is not organic. For us it is all about work and survival.\u0027         Malabar Baby was founded by wealthy Indian-American Anjali Harjani-Hardasani in 2014, after she moved from New York to Hong KongMrs Regar\u0027s husband Ram Gopal also works at Nayika where his duties include cutting the organic cotton for the blanket Archie was wrapped in. As a master cloth cutter, he earns more than his wife, taking home around 15,000 rupees per month (£176).The couple start work at 9.30am and finish at 5.30pm, six days per week. They are only given 25 minutes for lunch and are not provided with any formal contracts.Their salaries may seem low by western standards but in Mr Gopal\u0027s case, he earns above the national average monthly salary of 13,000 rupees (£154). His wife however falls below this threshold meaning their combined income is barely enough for a family of eight. Neither of their sons are in full-time employment and have just started their own hand printing business from home. The family survives on a mainly vegetarian diet of rice, lentils and vegetables, which have increased in price in recent times. A kilo of lentils, for example, can cost anything up to 200 rupees (£2.37) while most vegetables are less than half that. The average price of a bottle of beer is also 200 rupees.Mr Gopal, aged 55, said: \u0027Even though by Indian standards my salary is just above average as a family, if you combine our income, we are poor and things are very hard. We do not know about the world of the rich and famous who buy the things we make. We do not even know which countries it is being sent to. \u0027My job is very demanding and requires a lot of skill but it is not very well paid. Sadly, it is all I know, this is the only thing that I\u0027ve done all my life.\u0027When shown a picture of Meghan holding baby Archie in the blanket he helped make, Mr Gopal beamed with pride.

These are then stuffed with mulmul, fine, soft cotton and then stitched to complete the blanket. Since Meghan appeared in public with Archie wrapped in it, orders have gone through the roof and around 2,000 are currently being made to meet demand. The hand-crafted blanket has sold out on the Malabar Baby website and is available for pre-order only.

Mr Woodford refused to go into detail about the tax bill he sold the shares to pay.His problems began when he pumped billions of pounds of savers’ cash into risky investments that were hard to sell in a hurry. At the start of June, he was hit with a demand by customer Kent County Council to repay £263million but was unable to sell enough shares.Equity Income was forced to block withdrawals and start a massive sell-off.Link Fund Solutions, an independent company tasked with making sure Equity Income follows the rules, has now told investors this suspension is likely to last until early December for Mr Woodford to complete ‘a measured and orderly repositioning of the fund’s portfolio of assets’.In a defiant update on his website, Mr Woodford apologised but insisted he will be proved right. He said his investing strategy is based on a view that the world economy is heading for the rocks.‘Admittedly, this strategy has not delivered the returns we had anticipated over the past couple of years,’ he said.‘I understand the frustration, inconvenience and anxiety the continued suspension of the fund will be causing.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Fed land owner leaves notices cars parked ground","story":"Share this article He said: \u0027People are parking here during the day because they think it is \u0027no man\u0027s land.\u0027I have even gone to the extreme of putting the land registry detail on the notices so they can see it is private land.\u0027A few people have responded to it but the rest of them have not.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sure none of the people who are parking without payment would let me park on their driveway at home without payment or permission,\u0027 says Keith\u0027s note.

There was a minor injury to his pinky finger.He needed 11 hours of surgery to reattach the severed finger which is no longer functional.Farriss is seeking special damages – which aren’t quantified – for loss of earnings and future loss of earnings, as well as out-of-pocket expenses.Montana Productions – which is owned by Farriss and his wife Beth and controls his publishing rights and royalty income – is also seeking damages.“I find my reattached ring finger to be an annoyance and unsightly. I have considered having it amputated,” Farriss said.“I am no longer able to play guitar other than a few beginner-level chords.”The plaintiffs on Tuesday sought to amend their statement of claim in the supreme court but the defence opposed the move.Associate Justice Joanne Harrison reserved her judgment with directions to be issued on Friday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16d63ded0f53a2bacd30abde9b584ea4f33c6879/0_291_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4768c9d3654cb36e08bd47b34f417093","title":"womens work megan stack review","story":"“You should write about all of this,” suggests Megan Stack’s husband, Tom, in a well-meaning attempt to defuse yet another argument in the early weeks of their first son’s life. “This” meaning motherhood, domesticity, the perennial subject of a woman’s struggle to find some equilibrium between the old, professional version of herself and the new, dismantled by childbirth.Stack – a Pulitzer-nominated war reporter for the Los Angeles Times – is scathing about her husband’s ability to understand: “Tom, of course, was still at large in the world… He had become a parent and kept his career without making any degrading compromises.”The very idea of writing about motherhood appals her, conjuring the image of a “mommy blogger”. “Never would I absent myself from the broader world and its serious abstractions like politics and economics,” she writes. “I had beaten the boys before and I wouldn’t stop now. My writings would not be set among refrigerators and cribs would not smell of rubber ducks and diaper creams.”And yet here is Women’s Work, and every woman who has experienced the conflicts of motherhood, or is contemplating them, should be grateful for her unflinching addition to the contemporary literature on the subject.The landscape of motherhood has changed significantly even in a generation: when Stack is laid low by sleeplessness and suspected postnatal depression after the birth of her first son, she looks to her mother and mother-in-law for advice both, though sympathetic, tell her they don’t recognise the existential despair she describes. Perhaps it is a question of expectations. Rachel Cusk, in her 2001 memoir A Life’s Work, railed against the ways in which women like her (middle-class, educated) who have been raised to have the same expectations as their brothers are only brought face to face with the brute injustice of biology in motherhood.Women’s Work owes much to Cusk’s book, and echoes it often, since it is principally an examination of class, privilege and the apportioning of labour, with these distinctions writ larger because of the setting. Tom’s work as a foreign correspondent means that Stack has her first son in Beijing and her second in New Delhi, where – as all the expats keep telling her – “help is cheap”. But the affordability of poor women’s labour does not make the transaction straightforward, as Stack discovers when she employs a succession of nannies and housekeepers to free up time for her own writing, only to find that her home has become a “job site” and she a manager of employees, whom her conscience and gender solidarity will not allow her to disregard as simply “the maid”, the way her husband does.“A nanny, I was learning… was not a gadget who showed up and simplified life without complication. Xiao Li was a human being, and her problems had become my own.”All the women Stack employs are mothers themselves, who have left their own children behind in rural villages to earn a living caring for western babies in the city. When Xiao Li’s daughter is hospitalised with a heart condition, Stack, feeling guilty, gives her indefinite leave, while Tom’s instinct is to find another nanny who will turn up to work.Later, in India, their housekeeper Pooja is beaten up by her husband again, Tom wants to replace her with someone who will not bring her own mess into the lives of their children, while Stack struggles to find the right balance between authority and empathy when it comes to their servants. “The fragile membrane that had separated the harrowing existence of the vulnerable women we employed from our quiet domestic life had finally burst.”Stack is brutally honest in these pages, about her own shortcomings, as both mother and employer, her frequent discomfort in both roles, and in the fault lines that parenthood and its inequalities expose in her marriage. Her prose style is elegant, witty, self-lacerating, and she draws the characters of her household with the sharp eye of a novelist.The final chapter strikes a more sombre, journalistic note she throws out statistics about women’s domestic labour around the world, and comes to the somewhat banal conclusion that: “In the end, the answer is the men. They have to do the damn work!” Well, duh – this epiphany is not in itself an answer, and she knows it. But Women’s Work adds to the conversation about how we might move towards a better understanding of what that answer might be. The challenge will be getting the men to read it.This review is from the Observer• Women’s Work by Megan K Stack is published by Scribe (£14.99). To order a copy go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

Complex family dynamics and the corrupting influence of power drive a thrilling, twisting plot told through a series of flashbacks. This may be the fifth novel in the sequence, but razor-sharp commentary on current events – from the far right to race and media bias – makes it as relevant as ever. The ending will enthral and infuriate fans in equal measure.Equally topical is The Boxer (Hodder) by The Good Immigrant author Nikesh Shukla, a story of fear, hope and identity in Bristol. After being the victim of a racist attack on his way home from school, Sunny joins a boxing club, which brings him the confidence and community he craves. When a far-right march turns violent, Sunny risks losing his new friend, Keir, to radicalisation. The book is cleverly structured around a fight between the two boys.Identity is also at the heart of Kit de Waal’s YA debut, Becoming Dinah (Orion), part of the new Bellatrix series reimagining classics from a feminist perspective. Here, Moby-Dick becomes the resonant and original coming-of-age story of a teenage girl, although readers do not need to be familiar with Herman Melville’s classic novel. The story opens with protagonist Dinah shaving her hair as she prepares to run away from the commune where she has grown up. This metamorphosis sets the tone as Dinah heads off on a road trip of self-discovery.Laura Wood’s Under a Dancing Star (Scholastic) also takes inspiration from a classic, Shakespeare’s Much Ado About Nothing. In 1930s England, 17-year-old Bea is stifled by parental and societal expectations. A chance invitation to her uncle’s Tuscan home heralds an exciting, bohemian summer and the charms of Benedick, a handsome but maddening young artist. Sparky bickering leads to a challenge: can the pair enjoy the perfect holiday fling without falling in love? Heady, sun-drenched and achingly romantic.Darker but equally delicious is Deirdre Sullivan’s Perfectly Preventable Deaths (Hot Key). A move to the small Irish town of Ballyfrann initially intrigues twins Madeline and Catlin, with its quirky inhabitants and dramatic mountain scenery. But this is a place of secrets, where teenage girls have gone missing over the past 60 years. Sullivan’s prose bewitches in a tale featuring dark magic, supernatural predators and a plot worthy of Angela Carter.Tamsin Winter is fast becoming a favourite for younger teenagers, chronicling those first years at secondary school with warmth and honesty. In Jemima Small Versus the Universe (Usborne) Winter tells an empowering story about body confidence. Jemima is funny and smart but feels defined by her size, not least when she is made to join the school’s Healthy Lifestyle club. When she has the chance to take part in a TV quiz show, it seems an opportunity to overcome the bullying and insecurity and find her voice.• To order any of these books for a special price click on the titles, go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

We need your learned opinions to winnow this down to a shortlist next weekThis year’s Booker longlist has been described as “an absolute gift for bookselling” and seems popular with critics and the book-buying public alike, which is excellent. I hope it’s going to be a vintage year. But still: it isn’t as long as our longlist.This year, a mighty 170 books have been nominated for the Not the Booker prize. That’s an impressive indication of the scale of publishing in English-language fiction and of the enthusiasm you guys have for reading. But now, it’s time to start talking about how good some of these books are. To do that, we need to produce our shortlist.The first part of that process is to whittle down 163 books to a far more manageable three, which we will then add to three more – one selected by last year’s judges and one from each of our two nominated book champions for this year, Storyhouse library in Chester and Golden Hare Books in Edinburgh.And when I say “we”, I really mean “you”. This is part of the competition that you control, because it’s your vote that will help decide which three books go forward into the next round.Voting is easy – or it will be if you read the following instructions carefully:In order for your vote to be counted and comply with our all killer, no filler terms and conditions, you need to choose two books from the longlist below, from two different publishers, and accompany those choices with a short review of at least one of your chosen books. It would also be very helpful if you could include the word “vote”.We’re hoping for a minimum of 100 words in the review. We won’t be counting all that carefully, as there are only so many hours in the day – but at the very least make it look like you care and please give us your honest feelings.That’s it.

Annual results published more than 10 hours late on Friday revealed that Sports Direct was struggling during tough trading conditions on the high street.The delay was caused by the sudden arrival of a €674m initial bill from the Belgian authorities, relating to VAT charges on goods moved within the EU. Sports Direct only has 35 stores in Belgium but has two warehouses in the country.Sports Direct defended its handling of the matter after the stock market closed on Monday. The company said it received notice of the tax bill at midday on Thursday and contacted its lawyers immediately. It did not receive further details of the demand until 11pm on Thursday, meaning its auditor Grant Thornton had to update its audit the next day.The Financial Times reported that Grant Thornton has told regulators it intends to quit as Sports Direct’s auditor after the retailer’s annual general meeting in September, after concern over the delay in passing on information about the tax bill. In its statement on Friday, Sports Direct made clear it wanted Grant Thornton to stay on . Logistics experts said the VAT bill could relate to either the movement of goods between Belgium and the retailer’s main distribution centre in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, or online sales.“The home truths about the core Sports Direct business were pretty shocking and management seems to be out of ideas,” said analysts at the brokerage firm Peel Hunt. “Whilst Sports Direct may have done all the likes of Nike and Adidas asked them to do in the flagship stores, the premium product that maybe it was expecting as a consequence has not emerged. And it doesn’t sound like that is about to change.”“Sports Direct now seems to be strategically snookered, checkmated and clean bowled. The shares are hard to value, but are surely only for the very brave.”David Cumming, the chief investment officer for equities and head of UK equities at Aviva Investors, told the BBC on Monday: “Sports Direct is almost a case study in failed corporate governance.” He said Ashley “has obviously got retail talent – or had retail talent”, but the firm had “lost its way”.In the annual results, Ashley said the state of House of Fraser, which his company bought out of administration, had created “significant uncertainty” as to the future profitability of the entire group. He warned of further store closures at the department store chain and said he regretted the acquisition. The results also revealed that a consultancy business owned by Michael Murray, the fiancé of Ashley’s daughter, Anna, will be paid £5.35m for “value created” for Sports Direct last year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f31f399908f1d7e20d25065a9b7a1c116190548/0_118_2531_1518/master/2531.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69eecc2318deb5949d466687fd48fe40","title":"british gas owner centrica loss iain conn","story":"Company cuts idend as it announces Iain Conn will leave next yearCentrica, the owner of British Gas, has said its chief executive, Iain Conn, is to step down next year, as it slashed its idend after a first-half loss.Charles Berry, the chairman, said: “Iain has led the strategic repositioning of Centrica since 2015 and has been the driving force behind our plan to turn Centrica into a sustainable business.”Centrica blamed an “exceptionally challenging” environment in the first half of 2019, including the government price cap on standard energy tariffs and additional pension contributions.The group took a pretax charge of £346m in the first half. This included £257m of restructuring costs, £64m one-off pension costs and asset writedowns of nearly £90m, partly due to the fall in near-term gas prices.It said the outlook was more positive for the second half of the year and this would continue into 2020.

Despite being a previous bookies’ favourite, Carney is not on a shortlist drawn up by France’s finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, who is organising the process of selecting Europe’s candidate.European countries will face a choice from a list that includes Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the former Dutch finance minister Bulgaria’s Kristalina Georgieva, number two at the World Bank Olli Rehn, the head of Finland’s central bank Portugal’s Mario Cénteno, chair of the Eurogroup of finance ministers and Spain’s finance minister, Nadia Calviño. The French finance ministry on Monday denied reports that Cénteno and Calviño had been cut from the shortlist.Despite reports that George Osborne was interested in the job, one European diplomat said the former UK chancellor and current editor of the Evening Standard had “never been a candidate”.By longstanding agreement, Europe chooses the head of the IMF while the US picks the leader of the World Bank, although that Bretton Woods-era convention is increasingly questioned by the rest of the world. The IMF wants countries to nominate candidates by early September, with the aim of naming Lagarde’s replacement the following month.The IMF lends to troubled economies and played a crucial role in the eurozone crisis, as part of the so-called troika – of the IMF, European Central Bank and European commission – that oversaw bailouts of Greece, Portugal, Ireland and Cyprus.Georgieva, a former European commissioner, is seen as France’s choice. The 65-year-old can only succeed if the IMF scraps an age limit that means its managing directors are appointed before their 65th birthday.Dijsselbloem, an ex-head of the Eurogroup who once said indebted EU countries had wasted money on “drinks and women”, would have to overcome doubts in southern Europe about his economic approach.Rehn, a former European commissioner for the euro, has been Finland’s central bank governor since 2018. He is likely to compete with Dijsselbloem for the backing of north European countries.Cénteno and Calviño complete the list.Carney is Canadian by birth but has British and Irish passports. However, there is doubt whether that will ever be enough for him to be considered as “European” in this race.Europe hopes to unite around a candidate at the end of the summer, shortly before Lagarde’s official departure on 12 September. The outgoing head of the IMF has already ceased to make speeches and policy pronouncements, since her appointment this month as the first woman to lead the European Central Bank. The new managing director will be expected to oversee a change in approach by the IMF, which has been criticised in the past for imposing spending cuts on governments facing financial crises. The Fund came in for particularly fierce criticism during the Greek bailout.However, one of Lagarde’s last acts as IMF head was to announce a shift in policy. She said the IMF would now urge countries to protect spending on health, education and vulnerable groups amid growing concern among its members about excessive levels of inequality."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c0a367a4815792bd854a37c4dfefcc7b4f8596e/0_34_3539_2126/master/3539.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21f83c82db7bf8312bbc6e05b4cc794e","title":"redesigning delhis champs elysees it represents all thats complex about urban india","story":"From heaving traffic and dense crowds to car-free and tranquil: that’s the vision for Chandni Chowk. But is it achievable?The Champs Élysées is one of the most famous streets in the world, but you could say the French were beaten to it by the Mughals. About 15 years before the avenue was laid out in 1667 in Paris, India’s Mughal emperor Shah Jehan built a grand mile-long street in his capital to reflect the glory of the empire at its height.It ran from Fatehpuri mosque at one end to the colossal Red Fort at the other and was lined with trees, elegant mansions, mosques and gardens. Provisions for the Red Fort, the imperial residence, were carried down the boulevard by elephants, camels and horse-drawn carriages.In the centre ran the clear waters of a canal, reflecting the moonlight, or chandni – giving the street its name, Chandni Chowk (chowk means open market space). On hot summer evenings, the Bishti, a tribe of water carriers, would sprinkle water from their goat-hide canteens to cool the street.But while the Champs Élysées has retained its grandeur, Chandi Chowk and the area around it have degenerated into a mess of heaving crowds, dense traffic, decrepit buildings, pavements taken over by hawkers, tangled overhead electrical wires and general mayhem. The area known as the Walled City, or Old Delhi, is probably the most congested place in India.In a cool, tranquil studio in Aya Nagar, far away from the chaos, an architect is working to restore the Mughal splendour of Chandni Chowk. Pradeep Sachdeva’s firm, commissioned by the Delhi government, began work in December. The area has already been dug up and work is under way in an effort to meet the January 2020 completion date.On his computer screen is an image of how it will look. The most striking feature is the absence of cars. His design shows a calm street lined with trees, benches and lights, with wide pavements on either side of a green central lane. The electrical and telecom cables and water lines are buried underground.Since this is one of the busiest market areas in India (the Khari Baoli spice market by Fatehpuri mosque is Asia’s oldest), vehicles have to be allowed in to unload goods – but this will be restricted to the early hours of the morning.“This is one of the most important street designs in the world because few streets are this old and few embody so much urban complexity,” says Sachdeva. “It represents all that is complex about urban India and if we get the transformation right it will become an example for hundreds of such precincts across the country.”He says western designs don’t work in India because they lack the cycle rickshaws, the street hawkers and the high density of people.One of the first decisions he made was to not recreate the canal. “We know from our other projects that we can’t look after bodies of water in India. They get full of waste. So we have symbolised the canal by placing water-like patterns in the central median.”Another tricky decision was where to place public toilets and police kiosks. He settled on placing them in the central strip, rather than on the footpaths where they would have been an obstruction.Sachdeva is acutely aware of how important the redevelopment of Chandi Chowk is for the residents of Old Delhi, the historic old quarter where the majority of residents are Muslim. For decades, they have felt neglected by the authorities who seemed to care more for other areas of the capital over the of part which, ironically, boasts all the heritage.Over the years, affluent Hindu families fed up with the congestion and pollution vacated their havelis – mansions featuring a courtyard, fluted columns and doors high enough for elephants to enter – and moved to modern houses in south Delhi.Many Muslim residents, emotionally attached to the Walled City and its Mughal heritage, stayed on. The Walled City was, after all, the capital of the Mughals until the last emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar, was deposed and exiled by the British in 1858. In 1911, the British transferred the capital from Kolkata to Delhi and built a new city – New Delhi – on the south side of Old Delhi.Old Delhi lost its status, but residents still derive pride from its historical importance and the fact that Chandi Chowk was once one of the most beautiful streets in the world. Most living here want it preserved as a beautiful historic quarter where visitors can walk without fear of being run over and where residents can enjoy a good quality of life.“It’s about restoring the original beauty of Old Delhi but it’s also about being good for business,” says Santosh Verma, the owner of a stationery shop. “We need a total facelift to create order and cleanliness out of this chaos.”The revamp of the entire area has been discussed for more than 15 years but no government has had the will to push it through. Sachdeva believes the Chandni Chowk project will kickstart the transformation of the whole Old Delhi area, but he has run into his own problems.A group of conservationists and architects have filed petitions in the Delhi high court objecting to one major feature of Sachdeva’s design: the placing of utilities in the central median. They claim this will act as a “wall” between the two sides of the street and destroy the area’s visual integrity.“In redeveloping an area you must respect its heritage, but the spirit of this processional avenue is being destroyed with this design,” says AG Krishna Menon, an architect and urban planner. “You can’t put electrical transformers and public toilets in the middle. It breaks up the whole vista. They need to be somewhere else.”In his studio on the fringes of the capital, Sachdeva sounds weary rather than angry. His design has already been through numerous consultations with multiple stakeholders. While he respects the need for democratic debate, he insists there is no other suitable location for the toilets. As for the transformers, if he had placed them away from the central median and closer to the shops and pavements, the shopkeepers would have been up in arms.“They would have objected. It’s also a safety hazard. Transformers have caught fire in the area. We have to keep them away from the shops and sidewalks,” he says. “Moreover, this is not a conservation project. It is not conserving a monument like the Taj Mahal. This is about re-developing a living street where people live and work. You have to strike a balance between heritage and their needs.”Sachdeva hopes the high court judge will let the scheme proceed. “People here have been waiting a long time for this transformation,” he adds. “We can’t disappoint them.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27be089055186ed1d08f1a62d944fd3e7b2b0dbb/0_152_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3eb95e5df7a936645e895aa33d191440","title":"jeremy corbyn labour party brexit","story":"Though I would win my appeal against expulsion, your losing mentality and lack of Brexit leadership mean I won’t returnBritain is in a moment of peril, the UK facing an existential crisis, a combination of Brexit and Boris Johnson reducing our country to a global laughing stock. I see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it. Whatever the denials, Johnson has embarked on a crash and burn strategy deliberately aimed at creating the circumstances for a general election – setting up the EU, parliament and the civil service, in a grotesque perversion of the truth, as the reasons he has no option but to call one.He rightly fears that if the people were given a straight choice in a referendum, “no deal v no Brexit”, no Brexit would win comfortably. But Johnson is confident that in an election choice between him and you he would win, and so get the mandate for the hardest form of Brexit he would otherwise not legitimately be able to claim. It means we could be weeks from an election in which, on any current analysis, you are unlikely to be in a position to win a majority.The future of the country is a million times more important than my membership of the Labour party. But the above situation has developed at a time this has been the subject of some public debate, as well as intense personal reflection.Having spent several weeks trying without success to have explained to me the process under which I was expelled for voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections, I finally informed the party I felt I had no option but to start proceedings. I was recently told that my case had been discussed with senior members of your team and that they saw two ways it might be addressed: 1. By a suspension of my auto-exclusion under cover of the broader possible review of the whole auto-exclusion system in relation to antisemitism and other offences. 2. That I make some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election. On the first, I was not asking for a suspension of my exclusion, but a reversal. On the second, while with the one exception that led to my expulsion I have voted Labour in every election in my life and would prefer to do so for the rest of my days, I did not feel comfortable about making a blanket commitment when politics is in such flux, and my concern about your stance on Brexit still acute.With the distance provided by my being away from the UK in Australia, I have reflected deeply on all of the above. And, with some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, even if I should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.The culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain. I see no strategy in place that remotely meets the electoral or policy challenges ahead. On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose.I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister. I do not blame you for Brexit and the mess the UK is in. David Cameron and Theresa May, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, Nigel Farage, and the UK media, they are all ahead of you in the queue on that one. But I do believe your half-hearted approach to the referendum campaign three years ago had a role in leave winning. Your failure to provide consistent leadership on the issue since then has been a huge disappointment. I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election, and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends. It is not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision. What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril. To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause – though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters. I have in the past, in various troubled eras for our party, always argued that it is better to stay and fight from the inside. My fear right now is that without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power. With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election.If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you. I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.• Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair’s director of communications this is an edited version of an article written for The New European"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bff07d3bd1aae370791acf4211334d9e893838c2/288_48_4032_2420/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da5125c4836f1914e842994f1eeb1664","title":"dont worry prime minister women have got your message loud and clear","story":"We saw it. We didn’t just hear it. It wasn’t a “domestic” that euphemism for the way men terrorise women every day. We saw Mark Field, the MP for Cities of London and Westminster, with his red face and bulging angry eyes, push a female activist up against a wall, put his hand around the back of her neck and then manhandle her out of a posh dinner. He later said he thought she might have been armed.There needs to be no further investigation into Field’s behaviour, according to our new prime minister. The case has been dropped. New broom and all just don’t hit me with it. Boris Johnson, of course, had to face down his own behaviour when the police were called because of an incident between him and his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds. We don’t know what happened, except that the police did not take any action. Then, there was a picture of them sitting in a field. What more is there to say, except we also know there is a recording of Johnson conspiring with a friend to get a journalist beaten up? But what’s a few cracked ribs?The message is frightening and clear. It is about who is in charge and about what kinds of behaviour are tolerated. Male violence, the violence that all women internalise as if by osmosis, exists to shut us up and shut us down. Don’t fuss. Don’t call the police. It’s all in the past or a private matter.Two women every week are killed by men who profess to love them. Sometimes, they are strangled to death in “sex games that go wrong”, the burgeoning new defence for murder.Either violence against women is a priority or it isn’t.

But why not reward work with local communities instead?We have drifted into a university system in which economic growth is valued over everything else. In many universities, I would argue that this has overtaken the focus on achieving a positive impact on society. This marketised system risks becoming further entrenched if the Augar review of post-18 education is implemented, particularly through the focus on graduate salaries as a measure of a university’s success. It’s been suggested that to remedy this we should overhaul the university system entirely, but that’s not the only solution.Universities are autonomous institutions in which academic freedom is the fundamental principle. In today’s world, in which half the nation attends a university, it is also clear that they carry a civic responsibility to engage with society – yet it’s hard to argue that either is the case in the UK anymore.Universities now often have to mimic business practices in order to survive, and many end up spending millions simply to attract fee-paying students. Universities are forced to compete with each other to offer courses that provide “value for money”. At a time when Britain faces pressing social problems including growing inequality, the educational sector has an important role to play. The problem with the Augar recommendations is that they are a missed opportunity to provide a clear vision for how universities could do more to help confront societal challenges.A new sector-wide strategic agenda focused on social impact could find genuine cross-party endorsement, unlike the isive issue of tuition fees. But how would it work in practice? The government could introduce a new social impact survey of universities’ work in this area, perhaps by integrating it into an existing initiative that assesses the impact of their work, such as the research excellence framework. This would measure not only teaching and research, but also the other projects that students and staff engage in.Two key measures would be the extent to which university projects engage with the public, and how successfully they focus on social challenges in the local area. The government could consider providing funding to universities which perform well to enable them to expand their work.This may sound costly and impractical, but some universities are already doing it. King’s College London, for example, is currently conducting a survey of students and the public aimed at identifying its social impact. The survey uses the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a benchmark. One of the areas where the university is currently achieving the most is in addressing the air quality exposure of children.The SDGs are 17 global policy aims adopted at a United Nations summit in 2015 which aim to solve the world’s biggest problems by 2030, and could provide a useful framework for a government-backed national survey scheme. They are already transforming the way universities operate elsewhere. In Japan, Hokkaido University’s Graduate School of Infectious Diseases is using SDG3 – the goal on good health and wellbeing – to guide its research. In Ghana, meanwhile, All Nations University College’s work on empowering women through education is based on SDG5 on gender equality.No matter what exact assessment methodology is used, the first step is to get social impact on the agenda in the UK. As Geoff Mulgan, chief executive at innovation agency Nesta, has pointed out, universities can benefit from being more “challenge-driven” and focused on real-life problems in their curriculum.A century ago, when universities were only for the select few, it did not matter whether they prioritised scholarly freedom or benefited broader society. Now that they split the country into two camps, in terms of who goes and who doesn’t, society has a stake in the matter. With the next general election looming, it’s time the public demanded universities focus more on social impact. Only then will party leaders and vice-chancellors have to sit up and take note."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d73d77f91782db48258dde26e27f8870759045e9/108_0_2986_1791/master/2986.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026a027058170744c519a5b17e7035f3","title":"posh bristol university expanding wrong side of tracks","story":"Bristol University, part of the Russell Group and a favourite among private school students, has long been at the privileged heart of Clifton. But it has radical plans to pull in the deprived communities to the south and east: starting with a campus on what its management calls “the wrong side of the tracks”.The university was one of the first to introduce “contextual offers” – lower grade requirements to students from a list of schools – back in 2009. Now it wants to go further by introducing flexible courses designed to appeal to people in deprived local districts, even if they haven’t performed well at school.The new Temple Quarter campus will be built on the urban east side of Bristol Temple Meads station, on the site of a well-known local eyesore– a post sorting office that had lain derelict for 20 years. “People on that side of the city don’t have access to the city centre, and many kids will grow up never going there,” says Orpen. “Transport is fragmented and poor. Many young people don’t have a sixth form they can get to. It is just a few miles away from us in the west of the city but it is a different world.”Bristol was the first university to announce plans to expand significantly when the government removed the recruitment cap in 2015. The new campus, which will house 3,000 students, represents a second big expansion. It will be eyed with trepidation by other nearby universities that already accept students – and their £9,250 a year fees – with lower grades.Joanna Holmes, CEO of the Barton Hill Settlement, a community centre offering services from legal advice to bringing people together for barbecues, says that over in Clifton the university is unreachable in more ways than one. “It is symbolically posh,” she says. “This new campus feels like the university coming down the hill to the rest of us.”Holmes’s settlement was actually set up by the university in 1911. The idea then was that Bristol staff and students would live there and spread enlightenment: it was a radically liberal community, supporting campaigns such as votes for women and feeding the families of local workers when they went on strike. But the relationship dwindled and the university hasn’t had anything to do with Barton Hill since the 1970s.That is all about to change. In addition to the new campus, due to open in 2022, the university is planning a “micro-campus” in brightly painted shipping containers within the Barton Hill settlement for people who still find the whole idea of university a step too far.It will have three containers in which to teach its students. Upstairs will be tiny bedsits for people who want to study but need a place with a stable low rent, or time away from complicated situations at home, to make that possible.Holmes says people in her community aren’t short of aspirations. “A lot of our families have two adults working three jobs between them working all hours of the day and night. They get basic qualifications and then drop out of the system because there is nothing that fits their lives. It makes it hard to break out,” she says.“We are saying to local mums, ‘Don’t just do as many cleaning jobs as you can so your kids can go to university. You can go too.’”Tom Sperlinger, professor of literature and engaged pedagogy at Bristol, has been tasked with finding ways of pulling people from deprived communities such as Barton Hill and Hartcliffe into the new Temple Quarter campus. He is working on a business case for a new flexible degree for local people. The plan is that you could take a short course in one of the Barton Hill shipping containers – or in the local library in Hartcliffe – and get 30 credits that count towards a degree.“If you do that in your local library and find it’s achievable and not all that scary, it maybe seems less scary to think about going to the main campus,” he says.Bristol has already experimented with access courses, which are not common in Russell Group universities. Ninety per cent of students on its year-long foundation programme in the arts and humanities don’t have A-levels – and the university says three-quarters of them go on to study a degree at Bristol or elsewhere. The course is publicised widely in local media and the university runs taster courses with community organisations, including Bristol Refugee Rights and the Single Parent Action Network.Myla Lloyd was part of the first year of this foundation course in 2013 and now works for a local MP. “I got good results in my GCSEs, but my Dad passed away and that started a trajectory where everything was knocked off course for me,” she says.She left home at 17 with no A-levels and worked mainly in coffee shops until she started the foundation course at 21, going on to gain a first-class degree in history of art at the university and says the foundation course changed her life.Lloyd hopes Bristol’s new project will open up the university to local people who have found themselves shut out from education. “The university is this big fancy building and it must seem very far removed if you live on an estate in Hartcliffe,” she says. “People often can’t even afford a bus ticket to get into the centre. And if you haven’t ever been to a youth centre, let alone a museum, why would it occur to you to go to university?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eed85854ae54350d1327e1249b4f898709c83e52/25_0_3210_1927/master/3210.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b08783102510b991aa025781a119283d","title":"us soccer equal pay womens players mens players uswnt","story":"US Soccer says the players on USA’s Women’s World Cup champions were paid more than their male counterparts from 2010 through 2018.According to a letter released on Monday by the US Soccer president, Carlos Cordeiro, the federation has paid out $34.1m in salary and game bonuses to the women as opposed to $26.4m paid to the men. Those figures do not include benefits received only by the women, like healthcare.The federation released the figures as it moves toward mediating a federal lawsuit in which players for the women’s team accused US Soccer of “institutionalized gender discrimination” that includes inequitable compensation when compared to players on the men’s team.Comparing compensation between the two teams is difficult because the pay structure is based on different collective bargaining agreements. For example, players for the women’s team have a base salary while the men are paid based on matches and performance.“In the weeks ahead, we’ll focus on preparing for mediation and resolving this matter in the best interests of the WNT and US Soccer. I want you to know that US Soccer is committed to doing right by our players, and I’ve been encouraged by the public comments from players expressing their desire for a cooperative approach. I remain optimistic that we can find common ground,” Cordeiro wrote. “Together, I believe we can get this done.”Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players in matters involving the lawsuit, called the letter “a sad attempt by USSF to quell the overwhelming tide of support the USWNT has received from everyone from fans to sponsors to the United States Congress.“The USSF has repeatedly admitted that it does not pay the women equally and that it does not believe the women even deserve to be paid equally,” Levinson said. “This is why they use words like ‘fair and equitable,’ not equal in describing pay.”Cordeiro said the federation recently conducted an extensive analysis of its finances over the past 10 years, seeking to clear up what he called confusion based on the pay structures for both teams.US Soccer said it pays the women’s national team players a base salary of $100,000 per year, and an additional $67,500 to $72,500 per player as a salary for playing in the National Women’s Soccer League. The women also have healthcare benefits and a retirement plan.Conversely, players on the men’s national team are paid by training camp call-ups, game appearances and through performance bonuses. The federation says the men have the ability to earn higher bonuses that the women. The collective bargaining agreements are not made public, and US Soccer did not provide details about the men’s bonus structure.USSF also says the men’s team generates more revenue. The women’s team generated $101.3 m over the course of 238 games between 2009 and 2019 while the men generated $185.7m over 191 games, according to the federation.The analysis did not include prize money for tournaments like the World Cup, because those funds are determined by Fifa, soccer’s international governing body, and not US Soccer.The letter comes amid increasing pressure on US Soccer in the wake of the women’s victory at the World Cup earlier this month. After the United States defeated the Netherlands to win a second straight title, the crowd at the stadium chanted “Equal Pay! Equal Pay!”During the World Cup, more than 50 members of Congress also sent a letter to US Soccer “to express our disappointment of the inequities in pay, publicity, and investment that the US Women’s National Team has continued to face.” Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia introduced a bill that would withhold federal funding that would go toward hosting the 2026 men’s World Cup until the issue was resolved.Cordeiro said in the letter that the federation decided to focus on winning the World Cup rather than debate the lawsuit.“Now that the Women’s World Cup is behind us, a common understanding of key facts will also help advance our shared work to grow women’s soccer in America as well as the larger national discussion about equality,” he wrote.Levinson maintains the figures provided by US Soccer are misleading. “The USSF fact sheet is not a ‘clarification.’ It is a ruse. Here is what they cannot deny. For every game a man plays on the MNT he makes a higher base salary payment than a woman on the WNT. For every comparable win or tie, his bonus is higher. That is the very definition of gender discrimination,” Levinson said in a statement. “For the USSF to believe otherwise, is disheartening but it only increases our determination to obtain true equal pay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdbc469ed0968bb6abb39c730156c987e61a9809/290_241_2264_1358/master/2264.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8480fa3f39f7df562f94554606a9b667","title":"idrissa gueye move everton psg joins transfer","story":"Idrissa Gueye has completed his move from Everton to Paris Saint-Germain for a fee understood to be €32m (£29m).The midfielder has sealed the transfer after Everton rejected a £21.5m offer from PSG in January.

Instead, Ibrahim is making sure people in Yammawar Kafawa, in northern Nigeria’s Kano state, are using toilets.Last October, the villagers agreed to stop defecating in fields, bushes and streets, and instead use the newly-built toilets, as part of the Nigerian government’s drive to end open defecation by 2025.“My message to our people is simple: use your toilets and make sure you wash your hands after,” said 36-year-old Ibrahim, who belongs to a community committee working to create awareness around good sanitation and encourage residents to use and build better latrines.The government has acknowledged the dire situation, with Muhammadu Buhari, the Nigerian president, declaring a state of emergency on water, sanitation and hygiene in November 2018. This was followed by a national campaign – Clean Nigeria: Use the Toilet – launched in April 2019 to jumpstart the implementation of a national action plan to reach the 2025 target.The government is working with the UN children’s agency, Unicef, the UK’s Department for International Development (DfID), the EU, and NGO WaterAid.Ibrahim, a father of six, admitted to practising open defecation until government officials visited the village and explained how the habit endangered health. The visit had an instant effect. Villagers worked as a group to improve sanitation and to encourage families to dig pit latrines. Now, anyone found defecating in the open faces a fine.Hand-pump boreholes were also dug with the support of Unicef and DfID to encourage people to wash their hands after going to the toilet, and villagers built a hand-washing site.In April, Yammawar Kafawa became open-defecation free, a status that state authorities are working to certify officially.Community-led projects like those in Yammawar Kafawa are proving effective elsewhere in Nigeria.A four-year evaluation of WaterAid schemes in 247 communities in Enugu and Ekiti states, by the London-based Institute of Fiscal Studies and Royal Holloway, University of London, found that community-led total sanitation programmes increased toilet ownership by 10 percentage points, and decreased open defecation by 9–10 percentage points.“Our evaluation of the Nigerian programme implies that resources can be used in a more efficient manner by targeting sanitation programmes at poorer rural areas where they are more likely to be effective,” they wrote. “Better targeting of sanitation policies such as CLTS (community-led total sanitation) should take into account the fact that there are no silver bullets and that these approaches may not be appropriate in all contexts.”However, only 13 of the 774 local government areas in Nigeria have been certified as being free of open defecation so far.“We need to take the message to the public, we need to take the message to communities, and to households, so people can buy into the campaign and own it,” said Bayo Ogunjobi, a water and sanitation specialist with Unicef Nigeria.Ogunjobi added that more money and better collaboration between the government and local communities were needed, as was better access to safe water and improved sanitation in markets, motor parks, highways, religious centres, schools, and health facilities.“From all I know, the government is putting important steps into place to improve their strategy and ensure financing for the same,” she said. “And this is important as I believe that business as usual, would not get them to meet their target.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fa385bea765299e54eb4db88662c459596fc594/0_187_4688_2813/master/4688.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d21773c3a9959dfb51516aab258fcaa1","title":"how we met she gave me what i call the electric hug i felt my hair stand up","story":"Kate Minchin, 44, a writer, and Sue Stark, 58, who works for a solar energy company, live in New York. They met on an all-women motorcycle trip‘We got to the front of the pack and sped off,” says Kate. She and Sue had reached the highest point on one of the highest motorable roads in the world, in the Ladakh region of northern India, and were alone for the first time. “It’s a tough bike ride to do – it’s not just a gravel path, they are like boulders,” says Kate. “So the adrenaline was flowing, but I was also chuffed because I was on my own with Sue. I was like a teenager.”They had met at a hotel in Delhi 10 days earlier, in July 2015, where nine of them had gathered for an all-women motorcycle trip. Neither made much of an impression on each other – they just got on with the trip, riding all day and meeting at hotels and camps in the evening. It was in Leh, northern India, where they had stopped for a couple of days before the final, highest leg of the journey, that Sue and Kate got talking. “We had more time to hang out, have a beer, get to know each other,” says Kate. “That was the point at which I started to think: ‘Oh bugger, I think I fancy her.’” She laughs. “Sue was adventurous, keen on biking, gorgeous. Also, she can be a bit of a tough cookie, initially, and I like a bit of a challenge. I found that mysterious and appealing. When we started chatting, she was great fun.”Sue hadn’t thought of Kate in that way, except to mention to a single friend on the trip that Kate was also single and attractive. “She is adventurous, travel-loving, smart, and she has that wonderful British wit,” says Sue, who is from the US. “And I thought she was cute.”Although it was romantic up there on that road alone – they slid down snowbanks and threw snowballs at each other – Kate didn’t make a move. “I knew Sue was single, but she hadn’t given any indicators that she was looking for anyone, or interested in me. We had started to get on really well, but I assumed that those feelings were one-sided – and if they weren’t going to be reciprocated, I didn’t want to risk spoiling the trip.”A few days later, everyone was hugging goodbye at the hotel in Delhi. Kate says: “I stood next to her thinking: ‘That can’t be the last hug – I need to do that again.’”Sue continues: “I was about to walk out the door and she comes back over and gives me what I call the electric hug. I felt the hair stand up on my head. It was such an intimate moment that I looked around thinking: ‘Did anyone see that?’ I spent the entire trip back to the airport thinking: ‘Oh my God, I think I’m attracted to Kate and I left her in India.’”Sue headed back to the US and Kate came home to the UK. They messaged each other for a couple of weeks, then started video calling soon they were talking for several hours a day.In December 2015, Kate flew out to the US. “We’d already decided that we were going to give it a go at being a couple,” says Sue. When she picked up Kate at the airport, the feeling “was instant”, she says. Kate adds: “From that point on, it was perfect.” They had agreed that airport arrivals was not a suitably memorable place for their first kiss. “So we walked out to my car hand in hand,” Sue remembers. “And then I couldn’t wait any longer.”Kate stayed for nine days, then they began a two-year long-distance relationship, meeting up every eight weeks. When Kate left her job, she spent a couple of months in the US, where they got engaged, then applied for a visa. “After two years, I needed to know what was happening,” says Sue. “We needed to be together or starting the process of getting together, because it was just too hard.”Last year, they were married by one of the women on their motorcycle trip another friend from the trip was maid of honour, as was Sue’s adult daughter. They are planning lots more motorcycle adventures.Want to share your story?

It resembles the trunk of a young palm tree, but is a nauseous yellow. Could it be an elephantine tube of calamari? Or a rotating spit of alien corn? Or a California roll made of rubber bogeys? It looks as if Shrek has attempted to treat some variety of ogre lupus by cutting off his forearm. You wouldn’t feel compelled to rub any of these on your body, but I discover, with a sense of lumbering, Boris-Johnson-like inevitability, that this is exactly what I must do.The USP is that it vibrates. Hard. When I switch on the dismembered croc leg, it starts shifting eerily across the floor. Occasionally turning over, mostly it slides laterally, as if a poltergeist cat is toying with it. It has LEDs that correspond to three strength settings, a mini USB port to charge and … that’s it. I like that it doesn’t tack on any extras: no app that tracks you via satellite no default connectivity that lets it post trash on your Facebook wall. It does what it says on the tin – the tin being a pineapple-textured pipe of lime eyesore.And it does it well, if a spleen-juddering blood-shake is what you are after. Its most powerful setting is so immense that, when I roll my waist over it, my ears feel tickly. Resting my weight on it, the amplifications transmitted through the floor vibrate glasses on a table on the other side of the room. I try thigh rolls and shoulder presses from the handbook. The vibrations travel through my back, rippling the muscles across a large area. The motor keeps pumping robustly under my weight without slowing. It is uncomfortable, and difficult to endure for long, but that is how I feel about exercise generally. One of the exercises details a happy man sitting on his vibrating log. When I recreate the pose, it is an experience I find ... most interesting. I could imagine staying there a while.After I have finished rolling my legs, sides and other parts, my fingers feel tingly and my brain takes a while to regain equilibrium, like a rattled blancmange. I feel less stressed out by the state of the world, which is handy. I could have a long nap. Exercise is great, isn’t it? I try using the roller after a few long swims, but eventually I stop applying it to sore muscles and leave it to slither around on the floor. It is hypnotic to watch it hide under the sofa and jimmy into nooks like a long terrapin.I don’t do enough hard exercise to justify this chartreuse battery. Those who do will find it a balm for the bigger muscles and cheaper than a massage, if less precise. But they could also use a squash ball. Not that I am throwing my roller away, you understand. I don’t have much use for it, but I have enough. It is interesting.Fights sore thighs.

Three people in their 40s, 50s and 60s share insights they’ve gleaned from their journey through adulthoodWhat do you wish you’d known growing up?You don’t necessarily have to be in an intimate relationship to be happy in life.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?The quality of your thoughts reflect your life. If you’re laid-back by nature you tend to breeze through things. If you’re not, you should work at becoming more relaxed.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?How to ride a bike safely on the road. Conversely, drivers should know how to respect vulnerable road users.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’d spend more quality time with friends and family than working long hours.What do you wish children understood about adults?I wish they appreciated how hard it is to relate to them sometimes. It’s not their fault or ours, but you tend to lose touch with your childhood the older you get and it can become difficult to understand each other.What do you wish you’d known growing up?When you’re young you don’t have much confidence. I wish I’d realised that appearing to be confident often makes people take you more seriously. How you engage with people really makes a huge difference.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?If there’s something you want to do, don’t back out. People who are successful aren’t always the best at what they’re doing, they’re just the ones who push themselves. Don’t think about it, do it. It also helps to be optimistic and positive.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?I find anything to do with plumbing really complicated, but I recently learned how to bleed a radiator. Instead of sitting in a cold room for years I could have done something about it – so that’s a good skill to have.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?Before I had a family I had a lot of disposable income, but I didn’t save any of it. I wish I’d put some aside for later life.What do you wish children understood about adults?What gives you authority as an adult is that you’re regarded as omniscient, but it would be nice if children appreciated that you haven’t got the answer to everything.What do you wish you’d known growing up?The importance of learning. I treated education as a passive thing and assumed that other people who were clever were just naturally gifted – I didn’t appreciate the fact that you could educate and improve yourself.What’s your golden tip for how to breeze through life?Smile, be helpful and think of others. Because, as they say, what goes around comes around.What simple skill do you think everyone should know?Everyone should be able to recite a poem or sing a song from memory.And if you lived your adult life again, what would you do differently?I’m contented to have got to where I am. Maybe I should have speculated and I would live in a bigger house now, but I’m just not like that.What do you wish children understood about adults?I don’t think they have to understand adults – I certainly didn’t. Perhaps I still don’t. Adults shouldn’t lose sight of their inner child.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

Here, she shares how she stays on top of money, the mortgage and managing billsRuth Young, 26, is a marketing manager in Newbury, Berkshire. She bought her first home, a two-bedroom apartment at Newbury racecourse, through the national shared ownership scheme just over a year ago.I have a relaxed, yet healthy, approach to money. I know when to treat myself and when to be more frivolous, but I also know what I can afford and when I should put the debit card away. It hasn’t always been this way. A few years ago I was scared to even look at my bank balance and would try to avoid it at all costs, until I decided to get on top of things. Just knowing what my bank balance was has made a big difference.Until I bought my own place, I was a commitment-phobe when it came to my living situation. I travelled for nearly two years, lived at home for a while, rented a room with an ex-boyfriend, then rented a lovely two-bedroom apartment with a friend for nine months – until she decided to move in with a partner. Rather than carry on renting, I finally plucked up the courage to try and get on the property ladder and discovered that there were some shared ownership apartments coming up on the development where we lived.Now, my main monthly outgoings are my mortgage (for half my home), rent (on the other half) and a service charge. Bills – such as electricity, heating and water – also take up a large proportion of my expenditure, which I manage and pay for myself. Properly managing bills was one of the many things I was nervous about when buying my property. I avoided it at first, but then I realised that the longer I left it, the more expensive they were getting. It’s best to set payment plans up as soon as you move in, to make sure that outgoings are manageable and even throughout the year.Because I live in a new-build house on a new development, I’m limited in the suppliers that I can choose for electricity and heating, but I always make sure I’m on the most cost-effective tariff available. After bills, my money goes towards things such as wifi, Netflix, Amazon Prime, petrol and my mobile phone. Eating out and Asos are my two biggest non-necessities.I use several apps to simplify my money. I used to work with clients in the fintech industry and would always try to keep on top of new finance apps. I set up a Monzo account as soon as I heard of it (who can resist a shiny new card where you can categorise spending with emojis?). But it was also great to track my spending by category, set up budgets in the app, track against these and to be able to change my pin and block my card instantly.I’ve also recently stopped doing a weekly food shop, to save money. I live alone and often spontaneously see friends, family, and my boyfriend throughout the week in the evenings, so I used to end up wasting food and money with a weekly shop. I now only buy food when I know I’m going to be eating at home, which actually saves me money. I can’t be trusted in the aisles of Tesco alone! However, years of living with my cost-conscious parents means I’m good at turning off the heating and lights whenever I leave the house. I also love my smart meter, which sits in my kitchen and not only tells me the time that I’m making a cuppa in the evening, but also how much I’ve spent that day on electricity. It’s usually a good sign that I need to get out of the house if it ever goes over £1 in a day! I also swear by Giffgaff to keep my phone costs down.Living on your own comes with pressures, and managing a house and the bills that are associated with it can feel daunting. But if you take them in manageable steps and keep on top of your bank balance with what’s available – or not! – it can actually be really enjoyable.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

Here, she shares their budgeting dos and dont’s …Full-time hospital catering assistant Rachael Howe, 31, and her boyfriend, Pete Walch, an industrial chemist, have been together for three years. They live in a terraced house in Bolton with Rachael’s rescue cat, Winston.Generally, I have a cautious approach to spending money. I’m fortunate that Pete earns more than the minimum wage, so on the occasions where we’re faced with an unexpected expense, he kindly helps out where he can. I wouldn’t say we have a particularly frugal lifestyle, but I definitely try to be careful.I attempt to simplify my money as much as possible. I have a mobile banking app, which I love because it means I know exactly what’s going on with my account at any time. I keep my statements paperless so I’m not sifting through papers to track down transactions and if I have any expenditure that I can’t set up a direct debit for, I’ll either schedule the payment through my banking app or set a reminder on my phone for 48 hours before the payment is due, to remind myself so that I can avoid any late fees.Our main outgoings are rent, utility bills and food. Pete also runs a car, so expenses such as fuel and car maintenance are a fairly regular outgoing for him. I also set myself a weekly budget.I keep track of the hours that I work, round my hourly wage down to the nearest pound to roughly compensate for national insurance and tax and take off the cost of my main outgoings – rent, utility bills, phone bill, etc – then ide my remaining total by the number of weeks between pay days to give myself a ballpark figure. I usually err on the side of caution and reduce the weekly amount by £10 to £20 to give myself some emergency funds in case I need them, and so that I can hopefully accumulate some savings.I find that taking the time to write outgoings down in a notebook gives me more of an incentive to stick to my budget. For some reason, just working them out on a calculator without writing it down just doesn’t stick with me as well.We have also had a smart meter fitted recently and we switched our gas and electricity supplier a few months back, having compared several companies to work out who provided the best value for money. Simple things, such as turning lights off and half-filling the kettle when you’re only making a couple of coffees, all add up to us having cheaper bills.I have a few other regular routines to help me save money. The first is that I always put any loose change – smaller than 50p – from my purse into a money box when I get home. We also check the reduced sections of the supermarket for items we can either put straight into the freezer or use towards making a large batch of something that we then split into portions and freeze for a later date. We always make a meal plan at the weekend for the following week, so we know exactly what food we need to buy. I think it’s important to make a list before you go food shopping as well, and try not to deviate from it. Local markets can be a great way of getting the right amount of fruit and vegetables for you, rather than buying pre-packaged foods from a supermarket which can cost more money or mean that you waste more food. Also, never go food shopping when you’re hungry!If I was to give any advice to young couples who are setting up home, it would be to always try to plan ahead. By planning your meals and other purchases, such as clothing and even entertainment, you can save a fortune. Try not to buy “bargains” on impulse if they aren’t something you’ll definitely use. Keep an eye on your favourite retailers’ websites to check for upcoming sales, and most cinemas, pub chains and other entertainment businesses have offers that can help save you cash, especially if you’re going out with friends.Download the Meerkat app and use our Credit Card EligibilityCheck to find the right credit card to meet your needs.

I didn’t realise it was about the prohibition of teenage sex – but we got away with it’When I was a kid I used to sing everywhere – the bathroom, the grocery store. When some musician friends of my parents had a party, my dad suggested I get up and sing. People went: “Wow. That voice. She sounds like a 30-year-old woman.” Before I knew it, I was singing on bills with people like Little Richard and Jerry Lee Lewis.When I was 15, someone told a producer, George Tobin, about this “girl with a great voice”. George helped me get a record deal and things started to roll pretty quickly. I Think We’re Alone Now had been a hit for Tommy James and the Shondells in the 60s. I didn’t know the song, and it didn’t sound so modern. When I came back the next day, they’d remade it as a dance track. I didn’t want to record it, but I took the song home and my girlfriends were dancing around the room. My producer said: “Trust me on this.”I went back to the studio and did the vocals in maybe four takes. I don’t think I realised that the song was about the prohibition of teenage sex, but we got away with it. The lyrics are what teenagers think about: going behind a bush and kissing and whatever. People have since told me: “Oh me and my husband were in the car listening to it and …” And I think: “Way too much information!”The song took off when I sang it live. Because I was too young for clubs, we did a tour of shopping malls and shot some of it for the video. At first, I could go and have a pizza afterwards, but soon there were so many people that I could barely even get into the mall. Having a No 1 hit at 15 was a wild ride. I met Michael Jackson. Girls copied my earrings and my crimped hair. I still have “Children behave” – the first words of I Think We’re Alone Now – on my T-shirts. I love the song now and never tire of singing it.I Think We’re Alone Now was presented to me as a slow ballad by my producers, Richie Cordell and Bo Gentry. I was 19, but I heard the hook and thought it sounded like a hit. We did a quick demo, souping it up and making it much faster. When we played it to Morris Levy, the head of Roulette Records, he loved it, so we went back in the studio to record it properly. I recorded the vocal on Christmas Eve 1966, so we could get the song on the street for the new year.Morris was right out of the movies. At first we had no idea that his Roulette label was a front for the Genovese crime family. He was a mob associate and these mafia guys would hang around Roulette like it was a social club. We soon learned to tiptoe around and not eavesdrop on too many conversations. But Morris could hear hits and if it hadn’t been for him nobody would have heard much more of Tommy James.I Think We’re Alone Now was the first of what became known as our bubblegum hits. Richie and Bo would come to me with these really simple, almost nursery rhyme-type songs. I’d say, “I’m not singing that!” and half an hour later I couldn’t get the tune out of my head. I learned how to make records with I Think We’re Alone Now. We did the bass and drums first and then layered the rest – which we’d never done before – and made the choruses quieter so that the verses would explode out of a radio speaker. It became a signature sound for many other records.Twenty years later, I watched in disbelief as Tiffany’s version of I Think We’re Alone Now and Billy Idol’s version of Mony Mony – another of our songs – flew up the charts together like they were holding hands. Neither of them knew about the other before they were released. Tiffany came up to me at a convention to apologise for covering us. I said: “Are you nuts? I should be thanking you.” She did a great job, and she’s a real sweet girl.• Tiffany plays Rewind Festival South, Henley-on-Thames, on 17 August. Her album Pieces of Me is out now. Tommy James has recorded a new version of I Think We’re Alone Now for the forthcoming biopic, Me, the Mob and the Music."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8800782287458cbc0cc3b258f04671b06b465a70/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a49e66ee70820d279abf08520660bb0","title":"amazon 25 powerful jeff bezos podcast","story":"In 1994, Jeff Bezos founded Amazon, the company that has since made him the richest man in the world.

On the contrary, in so far as I ascertain a strategy at all, it is one that looks more designed to lose. I fear the country may already have decided that it does not intend to make you prime minister.”Campbell has been appealing against his expulsion since he was ejected under an automatic process designed to deal with those expressing support for another party. It caused mixed reactions at the time, with Charles Clarke, a former home secretary, revealing that he too had opted for the Lib Dems in the European elections because of their pro-remain policy, and Tom Watson, the deputy Labour leader, saying the move to kick out Campbell was “spiteful”.Others within Labour described the decision to expel Campbell as merely a matter of applying party rules consistently, while Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, celebrated his departure saying that “being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves” for his role in Blair’s government and the Iraq war.In his letter, Campbell said a member of Corbyn’s team had more recently suggested there could be two possible routes to him being let back into the party, one of which was a suspension of his auto-exclusion during a review of the party’s whole disciplinary system, and the other some kind of public commitment to voting Labour at the next election.However, he said he felt unable to give a commitment to voting Labour while his concern about Corbyn’s stance on Brexit was “still acute”.“I do not know at this stage how I will vote at the next election and I have made this decision after discussing it with nobody apart from family and a small number of close personal friends,” he said, adding that this was not part of some bigger plan but a deeply personal decision.“What I do know is that this is indeed a moment of real peril,” he wrote. “To have any chance of stopping Johnson and stopping a hard Brexit, you need to step up now, and signal leadership of the anti-Brexit, anti-populist cause, though it may be that loss of trust in your approach to Brexit means it is too late to win back many former supporters.”Corbyn said at the weekend he was “raring to go” and ready for an election against Johnson, which could come as early as this autumn if the EU is not open to changing the withdrawal agreement and parliament blocks a no-deal Brexit.Labour has changed its policy to call for a second referendum on any deal and to avoid no deal, but some Labour MPs are still pushing for a more unequivocally pro-remain position in all circumstances to head off the threat of the resurgent Lib Dems and win over anti-Brexit swing voters.Since Johnson came to power, his government has enjoyed a modest boost in the polls, with some putting the Conservatives neck-and-neck with Labour and others putting the Tories ahead.Campbell said he did not feel Corbyn’s shift towards supporting a second referendum went far enough, arguing: “Without real change, there will be nothing left to fight for, and that your place in history will be as the leader who destroyed Labour as a serious political force capable of winning power.“With a government this bad, pursuing a ruinous form of Brexit that will so damage our economy, society and standing in the world, Labour should be poised to win an election,. If the public could see that clear, credible and coherent alternative across the despatch box, ably led, we would be. That the country does not see it is, I am afraid, very substantially down to you.“I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few, that can win again the kind of majority needed to improve the life chances of those who will be damaged by Brexit. In the meantime, please, for the sake of the party and especially for the sake of the country, think beyond the messenger, and think seriously about the message.”Labour had no comment on Campbell’s letter. It comes after Peter Mandelson, another former Labour strategist under Blair, gave an interview over the weekend calling for a new party leader, although he said he would not leave the party.“We are now in a situation where many people will react with horror against what Johnson plans to do – defying parliament to take Britain out of the EU without a deal to safeguard our trade and jobs – but have no faith in Corbyn’s desire or ability to block this,” Mandelson told Alain Elkann for La Stampa and other European newspapers.“Corbyn is not the leader that Labour needs at this time. He cannot deliver. Even his supporters are realising this. We need an alternative who can stand up to Johnson and lead the country against the disaster which is in the making.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ec9e6464b8f367655d0fa7cfcc75fd8e7b37053/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=900d47fb96c9e2bca14984fea8791696","title":"lib dems quiet bollocks to brexit brecon and radnorshire byelection","story":"Party is hoping a byelection win in leave constituency can kickstart its Westminster revivalIt may seem odd to omit what has become the Lib Dems’ defining selling point from the literature of its candidate, Jane Dodds, though in between pledging investment in health and social care and delivering for farmers, she promises to “fix our broken and ided politics” – code for disillusion with the major parties and the failure of Westminster to break the Brexit impasse.Dodds is cautious in the way she talks to voters about Brexit, restricting herself to discussing the perils of no deal and its effect on the constituency’s sheep farming and automotive workers, though she says the party’s stance is hardly a secret.Unlike many MPs, and some of the activists who have come to the constituency to campaign, hoping to help stop Brexit, she says the 2016 referendum made her resolve to listen more.“The referendum result was a shock, it made me think more than anything though that we need to get out more and talk to more people,” says Dodds, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats.In Brecon and Radnorshire, she says she has found a deep disconnect between its inhabitants and Westminster politics, often a physical one because of a loss of local services and frustration with issues such as broadband infrastructure. No deal will “potentially decimate” sheep farming, the economic and cultural lifeblood of many communities, she says.“The first thing that I’m clear about is that a no-deal Brexit must be taken off the table,” says Dodds, drinking coffee in the sunshine in Crickhowell before a day of canvassing. “But beyond that, people do know what the Lib Dem position is, though – we aren’t dishonest about that – and they know we are a remain party who will campaign for a ‘people’s vote’.”Though Dodds is keen to keep issues local, the vote on Thursday will have huge national significance. Chris Davies, the ousted Conservative MP convicted of expenses fraud, is fighting again for the seat after a byelection was triggered by a recall petition.Should Dodds win, the Conservative majority will dwindle to just one seat, just a week after Boris Johnson was installed as prime minister. Conservative campaigning has been low key, though Johnson is scheduled to visit on Tuesday. There are some nerves about a “Boris bounce”, but Lib Dems are outwardly confident of taking the seat, believing that Davies’ reselection as a candidate is a sign that CCHQ wants a convenient excuse for a loss. The Brexit party will also stand, making it more likely the leave vote will split.Nigel Dances, 62, a project engineer in the car industry, is a particularly receptive punter on the doorstep. For him, a no-deal Brexit would be personal, though he is wary about stopping Brexit entirely. “I’ve always believed it was better to stay in and particularly for my business it would be catastrophic if we had no deal,” he tells Dodds. “The extra taxes make a huge difference to the margins of the business. But I do believe we need to respect democracy and people voted to come out. I don’t know if they ever realised the implications, that’s the thing.”Antonia Harrison, an activist who travelled from Portsmouth to campaign, has had to temper her pro-European enthusiasm when speaking to voters. “I’m a European first and foremost: it’s my identity, it made me determined to try and stop this,” she says. “But it is different here, I find a lot of people are saying they voted to leave. Some have said they would vote Lib Dem but because they voted leave, then they can’t this time.”One of the biggest challenges is getting around a constituency the size of Luxembourg mostly crossed by winding country lanes. Dodds says she is walking about 20km a day and driving between districts as much as three hours apart. On election day, activists will need to cover a huge area as turnout could make the difference.The Lib Dems have attracted campaigners from across the UK, as well as two who have flown over from Hong Kong and Toronto. Local organisers claim volunteers include former Tory members from London and current Labour members.On Crickhowell’s high street, opinion is ided. Robin Masefield, 33, the owner of Natural Weigh, which sells food and household products without packaging, is keen for a Dodds victory. “I hope she gets it, I just don’t support the Conservatives’ political views whatsoever,” he says. “Boris is a character, there’s no doubt about that but I do think he is likely to keep his promises. I think he’s for us: Britain will come first.”Many residents are amused, more than anything else, that the media circus is now making its way to Brecon. Marianne, a pensioner travelling down Crickhowell high street, said she had been surprised to find the former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron ringing her doorbell. “I couldn’t believe it,” she says. Though it is local issues that will affect her vote, she says many people have found Davies to be personable and effective. “Local people are so fed up about Brexit I think they won’t want to think about it and will vote for whoever they would usually vote for. It is local things that matter more.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e56b5c4baf16bd0b38bfbc2d46beb8950a683f7a/0_71_4832_2899/master/4832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fb988966a0a35273c5d5332740d35420","title":"what vote leave leaders really said about no deal brexit","story":"Dominic Raab’s comments on Monday’s Radio 4 Today have come under scrutinyIt was a contentious suggestion – but the new foreign secretary, Dominic Raab was adamant. During an interview on BBC’s Today programme, he seemed to say the 2016 referendum result gave a mandate for a no-deal Brexit.In a testy exchange, he insisted it was made “clear” by “those on the campaign” that “we should strive for a good deal, but if that wasn’t available that we should go on and make a success of Brexit”.When repeatedly challenged on Monday about the claim and asked to provide proof, he added: “I was questioned on it by the BBC almost every time I appeared and so was Michael Gove.”Raab’s comments provoked the People’s Vote campaign to accuse him of trying to rewrite history. It said: “The reality is that neither the official Vote Leave campaign or any of its prominent spokespeople – including Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab – promised anything other than a deal with Europe and a continuation of free trade.”As the country heads towards the 31 October deadline, the  has analysed the previous stated positions of some of the key players in the Vote Leave camp.Most, including Boris Johnson, focused on the ease with which the UK would get a free trade deal.Two months before the June 2016 referendum vote, Raab told Andrew Neil on BBC Sunday Politics: “We’re very well placed, and mutual self-interest suggests we’d cut a very good deal and it’s certainly not in the European’s interests to erect trade barriers.”During an appearance on the BBC’s Daily Politics in April 2016, Raab added: “The idea that Britain would be apocalyptically off the cliff edge if we left the EU is silly.”In March 2017, Raab wrote in the : “If there’s no deal within two years, it won’t be for lack of an ambitious UK offer. It would represent the triumph of the EU’s rather inward-looking politics over the reality of the outside world. That would be a shame, but only serve to vindicate Britain’s decision to leave.”Invited to provide evidence for Raab’s comments to the BBC, a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: “This is not for the civil service to answer.”Johnson told the Treasury select committee in March 2016: “Our relationship with the EU is already very well developed. It doesn’t seem to me to be very hard … to do a free trade deal very rapidly indeed.”Speaking at a Vote Leave event in March 2016, Johnson said: “I put it to you, all those who say that there would be barriers to trade with Europe if we were to do a Brexit, do you seriously believe that they would put up tariffs against UK produce of any kind, when they know how much they want to sell us their cake, their champagne, their cheese from France? It is totally and utterly absurd.”He sought to reassure remain voters that the UK would still have access to the single market: “EU citizens living in this country will have their rights fully protected, and the same goes for British citizens living in the EU. British people will still be able to go and work in the EU to live to travel to study to buy homes and to settle down,” he said. “The only change – and it will not come in any great rush – is that the UK will extricate itself from the EU’s extraordinary and opaque system of legislation.”Johnson, then foreign secretary, told the House of Commons in July 2017: “There is no plan for no deal because we are going to get a great deal.”In April 2016, Michael Gove said the UK would have the best of both worlds. “Outside the EU, we would still benefit from the free trade zone which stretches from Iceland to the Russian border,” he said. “But we wouldn’t have all the EU regulations which cost our economy £600m every week.”Responding to the Office for National Statistics’ trade figures in March 2016, Matthew Elliott, the chief executive of Vote Leave, said: “It’s clear the trade deck is stacked in the UK’s favour. EU trade is shrinking yet we are held back from striking deals with emerging markets as we’ve given up control to Brussels. The real question should be why our EU neighbours wouldn’t be clambering over themselves to secure a free trade deal with their biggest market.”And in response to a report by The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report on the economic consequences of Brexit in April 2016, Vote Leave issued a press release with an accompanying note criticising the “flawed assumption” that the UK would not do a free trade deal with the EU after Brexit.It read: “The OECD states that: ‘trade with the EU and other countries would initially revert to a WTO MFN-basis’. This is a highly flawed assumption that not even the IN campaign seriously contemplates as a realistic possibility. Leading pro-EU campaigners have admitted the UK will strike a free trade agreement if we Vote Leave.”After the referendum, in July 2017, the then-international trade secretary Liam Fox said: “The free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. We are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9a9014ad8d8c1544bbf0678cc206e58f1e8f0e4/0_29_2320_1392/master/2320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f3e5ee3d8606a9a0c0c57db223bfc76","title":"australia good tempered ashes england cricket","story":"Australia could not have designed a better way to provoke English interest than this: Steve Smith and David Warner, the headliners of the sandpaper scandal last year, ending their bans and returning to the public eye through the World Cup, then Cameron Bancroft completing the triumvirate by joining the Test squad before the Ashes begin on Thursday.The reunion leads to questions about the nature of the reform and redemption that we have heard so much about. While the incendiary issue in early 2018 was ball-tampering, the plot to do so was formed during an angry Test series against South Africa in which Australia’s aggression blew up in their faces.That series followed an equally bad-tempered Ashes in Australia, where some Australian players used on-field abuse as an everyday tactic. Warner, in particular, was instructed from officials up the food chain to get in English faces and, after a 4-0 series win, they thought the approach vindicated. Warner was urged to replicate it in South Africa, with disastrous results.The tampering exposé also showed potently just how many Australian cricket followers felt distaste for and disconnection from their own national team. This was not criticism on partisan lines. It was a home public alienated by decades of behaviour that could not credibly be defended. Where Smith as captain had brushed off concern, saying he cared only that those within the camp were comfortable with their behaviour, Tim Paine took the opposite tack after his abrupt appointment as Smith’s replacement.“The first thing is we have to listen,” Paine said in Johannesburg in 2018 while the banned players headed home. “We’ve maybe had our head in the sand a bit over the last 12 months – that, if we continue to win, we can act and behave how we like and the Australian public will be OK with that. What we’ve found out in the past month or so is that the Australian public and our fans don’t necessarily like the way we go about it. It’s pretty simple. We have to listen. We have to take it on board and we have to improve our behaviour in the way we play the game.”With Paine setting this clear stance from the start the new head coach, Justin Langer, has supported it since arriving a couple of months later while Aaron Finch has carried it on after taking over Australia’s white-ball teams. For the time being it seems to have worked. The four‑Test series against India over the last Australian summer was robust, with Virat Kohli especially involved in some exchanges. But judging from player responses and stump microphones there was always a level of good-naturedness.So can the cultural shift persist now that the three players who triggered it are back in the team? Of course. It is not as though Smith is some force of fury he is just supremely focused on the job at hand. That is why he still middles shots or takes ridiculous catches after hours of concentration. He was influenced by the mindless chat about on-field aggression being “the Australian way” and lacked the imagination to challenge that.Acting out that mythology has been unconvincing in the Australian team for years. The former captain Michael Clarke’s “broken fucken arm” line to Jimmy Anderson was as notable for its posturing as its content. The generation after Clarke are not built that way. Their attempts feel equally forced. Even Warner spent a couple of years keeping to himself before he was asked to kick out the jams in late 2017.Admittedly another former captain in Steve Waugh has joined the team in a vague mentoring role and still trots out the national clichés – “the definition of being ruthless is fulfilling your potential and playing to the best you can possibly play” – while whitewashing his previous team’s conduct – “that’s what I wanted my team to do and, if they said that was ruthless, that was fine by me” – and insists the current crop are much the same.But Paine’s hold should prevail and those returning players can slot into an environment where this is no longer expected of them. In many ways it should be a relief, given they will have enough to think about just to perform in unwelcoming conditions. Smith has his preternatural focus on his side and privately is pacing the metaphorical halls, desperate to get started.Bancroft is trying to remain Zen, preparing himself mentally for the crowd response. “People will react how they want to react,” he said during the warm-up match in Southampton. “Hopefully I can use it to give me energy to want to perform well. I can’t control that. I guess the journey that I’ve been through the last 18 months, you get exposed to things like that.”Warner looks the best equipped. While observers may differ in assessments of his personal qualities, none could deny that stubbornness is one he is blessed with in abundance. The characterisation that he feeds off invective is over-egged but it does seem fair to say that he is able to strive hardest when he has something to push against.Warner’s discipline, Smith’s laser brain, Bancroft’s calm: these are the things the Australian Test team need in the weeks to come, not aggression or presence or any other euphemism. The most egregious thing about sledging has always been its pointlessness. Teams sledge while they are winning they do not win because they are sledging. Reviving that method would have no value at all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a317c233bd45c2338e4655dccc0c441c5a8dcbf/0_356_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d2142d6ea2149133efbbb51447f81c8","title":"houdini brailsford durability scepticism","story":"The Ineos team principal has ploughed on through a storm of criticism to toast a seventh Tour de France win in eight yearsOn a corner of the Place de la Concorde on Sunday night Michal Kwiatkowski dropped his bike, sat down on the cobblestones and tucked into hot pizza and cold beer.The former world champion, also winner of the Milan-San Remo and the Amstel Gold Race, went unnoticed as jubilant Colombian fans swarmed around the Ineos team’s bus and gazed adoringly at his teammate Egan Bernal as he waved from the top step of the podium on the Champs Élysées.Watching on, the team’s billionaire owner, Jim Ratcliffe, could enjoy the first fruits of his £40m investment in cycling, only four months after Team Ineos had been created. It had been a gamble worth taking.Ratcliffe and the Ineos team principal, Dave Brailsford, are kindred spirits, both knights of the realm, both maligned by the media, both questioned by the establishment over their ethics and both pursued by an army of trolls and sceptics.Brailsford has become the Houdini of cycling. Little more than a year ago, after a damning report by the DCMS openly questioned his credibility, his stock had fallen so low this newspaper described his promise to win the Tour de France clean as “an empty pledge”, while others called for his resignation and the revoking of his knighthood. Undaunted, he has ploughed on regardless. Brailsford now seems to accept that haters gonna hate, whether you win or lose.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsSeven Tour wins in eight years, with four different riders, would have been unthinkable less than a decade ago, when Team Sky first rocked up at the Tour de France. Now a Brailsford-led Tour success is almost regarded as routine and, as the 2019 Tour ended, Bernal’s victory barely raised eyebrows. It is almost as if Jiffy bags, salbutamol investigations and mystery testosterone deliveries never existed.Holding court in a Colombian football jersey in the Parisian dusk, Brailsford was bullish. “Tough times don’t last,” he said, “but tough people do. You can’t do this job without a thick skin. In sports management you need to be resilient and decide what’s important to you and what you are prepared to take on board. It takes me back to my upbringing in a Welsh slate mining village. They were tough guys, those miners, and you learn good values from them which have stood me in good stead.”His latest Tour win may be seen by some as payback for all the criticism but Brailsford dismissed the suggestion that he had been vindicated. “I got to the point where I felt life is for looking forward. You can look back and be angry or bitter but leading a group of other people to achieve something is a much happier place to be.“During the Tour last year I was angry. I felt like I was in a fight the whole time, I was stewing. Maybe age helps but this year I’ve felt a lot calmer: I don’t feel any less competitive but I’ve been a bit more measured and I’ve stopped fighting everybody.“You get some people in life who are haters. They will find something to hate all the time. But if you look at the successful people in life, they are not the haters. If you want to be a winner, hating is not the way to operate, to go about it.”He may insist that Ineos remains a British team at heart but the next generation of Grand Tour winners churned out by Brailsford are more likely to come from Colombia or Ecuador, than Kilburn or Cardiff.“When we started the team, there was a very Anglo-Saxon way about it,” he said. “You are going to do it our way, no debate about it, which is naive when you have Colombians and Spanish staff in the team.“The best way to do it is to understand other people’s culture, other people’s views and make them feel comfortable and help them perform to the best of their ability.”Brailsford said that his youthful experiences of trying to break into European cycling have given him an insight into Bernal’s needs. “When I was young and I came to live in France it was the loneliest period of my life. I had made a commitment to come here and I dared not go back as a failure, even though I was hating it.“I was really lonely and I realised I had to learn French and talk to somebody. Very slowly I integrated into the French culture. That experience stuck with me.”But while the 22-year-old Bernal has quickly established himself as the hottest property in the sport and the future face of Ineos, the sands of time are catching up with Geraint Thomas. After four crashes in a month, a crammed build-up and a lack of racing miles, the Welshman endured a bitter-sweet Tour.He was gracious in defeat but privately he was said to be distraught at his second place. In the context of his season finishing the runner-up to his teammate was no mean feat but he wore the expression of a man who realised he had missed his last opportunity.Yet for all Brailsford’s defiance, Thomas’s graciousness and Bernal’s wide-eyed wonder, the 2019 Tour will be remembered as a Tour à l’ancienne, when risk, flair and panache, personified by Julian Alaphilippe and Thibaut Pinot, returned to the biggest race in cycling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ba2e7368fd9c32002b82fd197a3e72da3e60a9d/0_150_3651_2191/master/3651.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dac5f28b56301a7e9f1abeabc999ad3d","title":"murky waters few to emerge unscathed from shayna jack doping case","story":"The adverse finding damns all parties – including the athlete, Swimming Australia and Asada “It could be meat, it could be mushrooms, it could be anything. It could be something in a bottle.” This was the explanation offered by Shayna Jack’s manager, Phil Stoneman, as to the possible source of inadvertent contamination that saw the talented Australian swimmer return a positive drug test for the proscribed substance Ligandrol.For the 20-year-old athlete at the centre of the furore it’s a nightmarish scenario. Following Commonwealth gold, and on the cusp of possible world championship success, irrespective of the ultimate finding of guilt or innocence, the spectre of drug-cheating will stalk any future success.Jack is entitled to the presumption of innocence, and deserves to receive fair process. The swimmer faces a potential four-year ban – yet in terms of reputational damage, in an age in which the court of public opinion is swift and corporate sponsors are not often forgiving, the swimmer has already been judged.Sympathy for Jack will of course be determined retrospectively, once the full truth emerges – if it ever does. But in a post-Lance Armstrong world, cynicism is increasing. This isn’t the carefree days of Dean Capobianco’s steak, or Shane Warne’s mum’s pills – since 2015 Ligandrol has appeared in 17 failed drug tests, prompting Asada to issue a specific warning about it to athletes last year.Swimming Australia’s handling of the failed drug test has also been found wanting. Adherence to a confidentiality agreement between SA and Asada was the defence offered to explain the governing body’s failure to immediately publicise Jack’s adverse test finding – a claim former Asada head Richard Ings has openly questioned, claiming the agreement between the two organisations would have allowed SA to air the news as early as 12 July.Instead, Jack’s sudden departure was left shrouded in mystery. Michael Bohl – the Dolphins assistant coach and close friend to Jack’s coach Dean Boxall – told media five days later the whole team was “not exactly sure” why Jack had departed, maintaining that it was for personal reasons.And even after the news finally broke – a month after the failed test occurred and two weeks after Jack was sent home – senior SA figures failed to front media instead allowing Dolphins captain Cate Campbell to field questions as the world championships came to a close.As management stayed mum, Mack Horton went bang. An Australian swimmer accused a rival of being a drug cheat, while unbeknownst to him, but not management, an Australian swimmer had failed a drug test.It’s not hard to see how rival nations, even some Australian swimming coaches, might call it hypocritical. Especially from a nation that has repeatedly put itself foremost in the fight for a “clean sport”.It’s a situation SA CEO Leigh Russell admitted was “bitterly disappointing” and “an embarrassment to our country”, not least of all because it overshadowed a world championship in which Australia performed brilliantly, with Ariarne Titmus, a stable-mate of Jack’s under the stewardship of Boxall, announcing herself to the world in emphatic fashion.Questions can also be asked of Asada. Explaining why it needed two weeks of confidentiality to investigate the original adverse finding, the Australian anti-drug agency explained, via a statement on Monday: “Often it is not in Asada’s interests for our investigation to be public in the early phase of our processes.”Via a post on Instagram on 28 July Jack details that the first she, her coach, or her management knew of an adverse test result was 12 July, when notified by Swimming Australia. How any of these figures failed to figure in any Asada investigation conducted between 26 June and 12 July remains a worthy question.On top of all this sits Fina, the global governing body for swimming – an organisation that is already facing an appeal from the World Anti-doping Agency over its decision to allow Sun Yang to compete in Gwangju despite ongoing proceedings against the swimmer.Horton’s persistent attacks on his rival have even prompted a remarkable response from Fina’s executive director Cornel Marculescu, who characterised the Australian’s stance as “probably more a personal issue than a doping issue” and his podium protest as some kind of childish tit-for-tat, calling it a case of “you beat me, I must beat you somehow”.It’s a startling diminution of very serious allegations by one in a position of such importance – especially given the forthcoming Court of Arbitration hearing into Sun’s case.Whether Jack’s failed test proves an acute misfortune or something more sinister, that claim now appears under dispute. To the detriment of all parties involved in this sorry saga."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b24a004988ebc7a9370c62cae5157afa3484a1/0_284_4587_2752/master/4587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd05e8a23c3dc7a5e07a320b0b78c002","title":"talking horses cross counter turn tables stradivarius lift glorious goodwood cup horse racing tips","story":"Back at two miles where he broke the track record for one mile six furlongs last summer, the former Melbourne Cup winner offers real value against the favourite in the Goodwood CupOver 400 of Great Britain’s roughly 450 licensed jockeys have yet to win a single race at Group One level. Frankie Dettori, by contrast, has won nine since the end of May and he will be a hot favourite to reach double figures when he rides Straarius in Tuesday’s Goodwood Cup, the feature event on day one of Glorious Goodwood. Straarius pushed the betting industry towards a Dettori-driven meltdown when he took the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot last month, taking his rider to four wins from four on the day.No chances will be taken this timeand John Gosden’s five-year-old is expected to start odds-on at around 8-11 as he tries to take his current winning streak to eight. Straarius’s backers may well find their heart-rate increasing sharply at some stage, as the favourite’s average winning distance in his last six victories is a length. And while he has always managed to get the job done, Tuesday’s track and trip will play to the strengths of a very dangerous opponent in Cross Counter (3.35).Last year’s Melbourne Cup winner was only fourth in the Gold Cup, just under two lengths behind Straarius, but he was held up behind a steady pace on his first try at two and a half miles and could never land a serious blow. Back at two miles on a course where he broke the track record for one mile six furlongs last summer, he offers some real value against the favourite at around 7-2.Goodwood 1.50 The handicap that kicks off five days on the Sussex downs this week is fiercely competitive. Six of the runners lined up for the equally competitive John Smith’s Cup at York earlier this month with Setting Sail, the favourite here at around 7-2, faring best in second place, but he is now 7lb worse off with Jazeel, who struggled for racing room on the Knavesmire. Jazeel has been in excellent form since joining Jedd O’Keeffe at the start of the season and Jamie Spencer, a dab hand with hold-up horses, is the ideal rider to deliver him late off a strong pace.Goodwood 2.25 Some exceptional colts have announced themselves in the Vintage Stakes in recent years including Expert Eye, Galileo Gold and Highland Reel, and this looks like another strong renewal. Visinari could not justify the pre-race hype when only third in the July Stakes last time but he lost little in defeat, while Positive, Mystery Power and Pinatubo, who looked like a potential champion juvenile as he pulled three lengths clear in the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot, are all unbeaten.Goodwood 3.00 This may be a slightly sub-par renewal of the Lennox Stakes which could offer an opening for Flaming Spear to run well at big odds. He spreadeagled a big-field handicap off a rating of 104 over track and trip last summer and, though he has not run since November, he has often run well fresh in the past. At around 16-1 he is a big each-way price."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5636502ee53f1b240f4467cb7084f074771cd5dc/651_64_1683_1010/master/1683.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6232376e42786950b0052d2e09d9a593","title":"rupert everett uncle vanya theatre royal bath","story":"He lit up the screen in the 80s – but things did not go as planned. As he takes on Chekhov, Everett speaks about stardom, midlife crises and penis paddingThe play’s opening has been pushed back a week, until Light is back on his feet, but if this production returns Chekhov’s 1898 play to the farce that Everett says it was written to be, and not a straightforwardly bleak tale of midlife ennui and angst, then the mishap has an edge of black humour, too.Talk about breaking a leg, I say. Yes, says Everett, and describes the strain of the unexpected on stage. “I’m in a state of collapse.”Perhaps because he is an actor accustomed to playing arch, unflappable types, he does not look as if he is in a state of collapse. He appears equanimous and elegant, sitting in a back room of the Theatre Royal Bath, bearing the mildly aristocratic air of a gentleman farmer. Aged 60, he lives in the West Country these days, having moved in with his 85-year-old mother a few ago, together with his partner of 10 years. “I now like trees and birds. And cows. I love cows..”It wasn’t always so. In the late 70s he ran away from private school, the shires and his military family’s Catholicism to make his name in acclaimed films such as Another Country and Dance With a Stranger. He also spent years doing drugs, clubs and parties, looking incandescently beautiful alongside Hollywood types.Life now is a far cry from all that. The ferocious beauty has mellowed into a gentler, crinklier handsomeness. He has a modesty that may reflect the lessons learned from the extreme gyrations of his career – from A-list stardom to the much-documented wilderness years.When I ask him about directing a play for the first time, he says it has been challenging “for a flake” but , at this age, he feels lucky to be challenged. While directing is new, the stage isn’t. He learned his trade at the Citizens Theatre in Glasgow. Three years before the film of Another Country, he starred in the play. Where is he more at home? “Because one is continually questioning oneself and what one is doing, you’re never really at home. You’re always starting at zero. I love being involved with theatre and film and with stories in general. I find each of them very challenging. Everything is a potential train crash, but that’s the nature of our business.”Vanya, the character Everett plays, is 47 and in the grip of midlife crisis. The play grapples with the loss of youth alongside the complications of love. Does ageing bother Everett? “No, I feel thrilled not to be young. I’m older, but I haven’t got any maladies yet.”And when you look in the mirror? “I don’t look in the mirror. Not much. I’ve spent a long time looking in the mirror … I had that gay shame when I was young. I wanted to be better looking all the time. I was always striving to look right.”Some of it was because of his size. He grew 12 inches when he was 15. His limbs are still rangy though he swears he has shrunk a couple of inches from his once 6ft 6in(-ish) frame. Back then, he had a 19in waist and was rake-thin. “That’s why I never felt good-looking. Immediately after I started working, I found these two queens who made padding. I had a padded bum, padded legs, padded shoulders.”Things have got better as he has aged. “I learned how to be more interesting as an actor. I learned how to write a bit. I feel very lucky that so many things came along.”He is right about the writing. His two autobiographies showcased a genuine talent, though writing is not an easy option, he says. “An actor is a group animal and a writer is a solitary animal. For a group person to isolate themselves and have just themselves to feed off is very complicated. Sometimes it goes well, but mostly it’s a process of endless reworking and getting it wrong.”Writing has also given him the freedom to create roles that were not being offered to him in film, he has said. He came out as gay in an era when it could kill an actor’s career, at the height of the Aids epidemic. He has said that it led to typecasting ever since, exemplified by his role as the gay friend opposite Julia Roberts in My Best Friend’s Wedding.Still, the dearth of acting roles is what led him to write the screenplay for The Happy Prince, a biopic of the elderly Oscar Wilde, which he also directed and starred in. It was a labour of love for Everett, who worked on it for over a decade, and it should have won the Oscars it was predicted to scoop. He has starred as Wilde on stage, too, in a revival of Hare’s The Judas Kiss, for which he brought back the padding of his youth. “I always imagined Wilde was revoltingly well hung. So I wore a padded cock and the front five rows, I could see, were thinking, ‘My God, I had no idea Rupert Everett was so well hung!’ I had go down a few sizes because it was taking over.” That was four years ago in the West End. “Maybe I should put it back in for Vanya!”The writing also became more necessary because of the growth of ageism, as he sees it, which means even male actors now must present eternal youth on screen. Men he says, had it very easy for a long time. “You could be a man aged 73 and have a 22-year-old girlfriend. That’s all changed. The result for us is that we haven’t got roles going off into the grey distance.”The prospects for gay actors have changed in Hollywood, he thinks, but only because the industry has been forced to accept it. Ironically, he has observed the erosion of gay rights in the real world. “It seems to me that there’s no ‘live and let live’ any more,” he says. “Last year I was opening my film in Italy, and you’d go to a place like Genoa, where the state withdrew funding for its gay pride march, and there would be other horrible things you’d hear, about families who’d locked up their lesbian daughter …”The world is changing in a way that gives him another reason to be happy about ageing. He is particularly despairing of British politics. “The end of it was Ann Widdecombe’s speech in Brussels. The most alarming, repulsive, depressing, shaming thing that I’ve ever seen. More shaming than Nigel Farage somehow, right down to the old cockney rolling of the Rs,” he says, and demonstrates the sound.Despair is a central theme of Chekhov’s play Vanya’s midlife crisis is filled with disappointment as he reflects on the past. I wonder about Everett’s midlife audit. There is regret at losing friends, he says, but he won’t be drawn on his famous falling-out with Madonna. “I think people who say they have no regrets are a bit wacky. There are so many things to regret. The way one treats people the way one writes off relationships the way one, looking back, backstabs. Middle age is a reckoning. You need nerves of steel to get through it.”There is disappointment, too. The reality of his life did not – and perhaps could not – meet the totality of his ambitions as a young man. “I wanted to be that big Hollywood movie star as a kid. I was so blindly ambitious that I would have done anything to get along. I mean, I wouldn’t have killed ...”But doesn’t he see through that kind of fame now? “Yes, but still … I think everybody’s disappointed. Everybody wants to have more.”So what is the ambition now? He is working on another autobiography about the 10 years it took to make his Wilde film. He has also written the screenplay for a film about Paris in the 1970s, which he is trying to get financed, and a TV series about a boyband.

The programme gives fact-checking organisations tools to scan Facebook for factual claims and mark them as true or false, and provide a link to a detailed assessment of their veracity.As well as providing contextual information to Facebook users, the service gives the social network the information it needs to suppress misinformation. The disputed content is left on the site but Facebook’s newsfeed algorithm shows it to fewer people than if it were not marked as false.Although Full Fact can check Instagram content, these checks have no effect on content directly. They only have an impact if links to Instagram content are posted on Facebook.The charity, which is paid by Facebook to provide the fact-checking service, listed nine other recommendations for how Facebook could improve its programme. These include automatically applying previous ratings to new attempts to repost the same claim adding more options that lie between “true” and “false” for posts that are unsubstantiated, humorous or lacking in context and being more open about any plans to use the results of human fact-checking to train automated systems to do the same thing.Facebook said: “We know there’s always room to improve.

There is no sand visible but the hidden banks below us are written in the surrounding water in the form of ripples, white lines of surf and patches of smooth water. These treacherous shallows possess romantic names on the sea charts – Pandora Sand, Thief Sand, Stubborn Sand – but sailors’ lives depend on avoiding them.The captain of Salford, our beautifully restored whelk boat, is trying to do the opposite, however: he’s trying to run aground on one. Our depth gauge drops from 6.9m to 1.4m. We stop and wait for the tide to beach us. Will we soon discover pristine golden sand?Picnicking and playing cricket on sandbanks at low tide was regarded as a grand day out by hail-and-hearty Victorians but messing around on shifting sands is not favoured in our risk-averse era. When a BBC film crew staged a cricket match on the notorious Goodwin Sands in the Channel a few years back, the in-rushing tide turned their boat over, requiring a lifeboat rescue.So, the decision by the Coastal Exploration Company, a band of capable mariners who take visitors to less-well-known spots on the north Norfolk coast in vintage sailing boats, to restart holidaymaking on sandbanks looks a little reckless. But I had to give it a go.Dom, the skipper, steers our 30ft boat through Wells-next-the-Sea’s pretty harbour in the morning sunshine. Our plan: breakfast on the boat, while we sail west to reach the Wash at low tide and “find a nice little sandbank to dry out on,” as Dom puts it – for lunch and cricket. “Any kind of waves would pick the boat up and slam it onto the sand but these conditions are nice and calm,” he says.Wells’ straggly line of colourful beach huts framed by white sand and dark pines slowly diminish as we head into the North Sea. The calm sea may be safe for us but it’s terrible for sailing. Luckily, Salford has a new engine that purrs as we potter along the coast at 4 knots.The seas here are shallow and studded with sandbanks, many of which now house offshore wind farms. It was once Doggerland and even today it sometimes looks like you can walk across the Wash from Norfolk to Lincolnshire at low tide. I’m astonished to learn that this great expanse of low water also contains a section called The Well, which is 47 metres deep.“Everything about the water is dangerous,” warns Charlie Hodson, our expedition chef and former lifeboat man, which could come in handy. “It’s about how you respect that water in return.”Charlie gives this warning as we pass the black silhouette of a ship wrecked on the sands beyond Scolt Head Island. This vessel was deliberately scuppered and filled with explosives to stop German invaders entering Brancaster harbour but we pass two more authentic wrecks visible on the vast sandy shores of north Norfolk.Despite the depth gauge reading 1.4m, the sandbank above which we first float doesn’t appear even as low tide nears. So we sail further along this wild, tranquil coast of sand dunes, windmills and flint church towers and around Gore Point. Ahead shimmies a line of gold: Sunk Sand, rising around two metres out of the water on the lowest of tides. Cormorants stand on the bank, drying their wings like enormous bats on the far side lounge the banana shapes of a dozen grey seals.Slowly, cautiously, we head towards Sunk Sand. Just beyond 1.5m, we run aground. The water around us is still chest-deep, so we blow up an inflatable dinghy to carry our lunch. I jump in and swim “ashore”, which is not as glamorous as it sounds – it’s easier to wade in the shallow water.We step onto our own utterly otherworldly, (extremely) temporary island. We can see Hunstanton in the distance to the south and Skegness to the far north but there is nothing else, and no one else, for miles around. The sand is smooth, wet, and scattered with giant starfish and dozens of sea urchins.Abruptly, the sun vanishes and a murk creeps in. Charlie hurriedly lights his stove, showing us how to fillet the seabass in the shallows. As he rustles up lunch we notice his pop-up kitchen is getting closer to the water. The tide is coming in already. Our sandbank island is shrinking.We move the kitchen 50 yards from the sea. It only gives us 10 minutes. The tide seeps over the sand and Charlie blowtorches the locally caught seabass for his take on “fish and peas and ham with a Masala flavour”. It’s delicious, and there is just enough time for a quick game of cricket. Salford is afloat again, and suddenly looking a long way away. Storm clouds build in the Wash’s huge skies.We swim-wade hurriedly back to the boat, and head home. The sea has turned choppy, the breeze gets up, and we fly past Scolt Head Island as sandwich terns e into the water and emerge, in a twinkle, gobbling silver fish.Rain arrives just as we enter the sanctuary of Wells harbour, sailing smoothly up the channel on a rising tide.This surreal day does not feel dangerous in such capable hands. Instead, the grand peaceful arena of this coast is profoundly soothing. And the wilderness of its salt marshes is nothing compared to the wilderness out there, among the sandbanks and cormorants, a strange liminal landscape where sand meets sea and the tide is the master of all.• The Coastal Exploration Company offers bespoke sailing adventures on the north Norfolk coast.

The plan was supported by Trump’s first national security adviser, Michael Flynn Barrack, Trump’s inaugural committee chairman and a consortium of companies led by retired US military commanders and former White House officials called IP3.One company was Westinghouse, the only US manufacturer of large reactors, which was bought out of bankruptcy by Brookfield Asset Management last August.The report comes alongside a number of other investigations into the administration being conducted by the panel chaired by the US representative Elijah Cummings – including into the use of personal texts and emails for official business by Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, and her husband, Jared Kushner.Trump attacked Cummings, an African American from Baltimore, in weekend tweets that the president’s critics denounced as racist.Monday’s report was based largely on thousands of documents provided by unidentified private companies. The White House, the report said, provided no documents, while other federal agencies submitted some.The committee may subpoena White House documents, it said.Documents showed that Barrack negotiated with Trump and other White House officials to seek “powerful positions”, including special Middle East envoy, as he took steps to profit from the civil nuclear scheme he advocated.A previous committee report, published in February, said efforts to advance the nuclear power scheme began during Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.Trump officials have continued meeting with IP3 even though White House lawyers in January 2017 instructed staff to cease work on the plan over concerns that Flynn was breaking conflict of interest laws, according to that report. Flynn, fired by Trump in February 2017, advised IP3 while serving on his campaign and transition team, said both reports.White House lawyers also worried that promoters of IP3’s so-called “Middle East Marshall Plan” sought to transfer US nuclear know-how to Saudi Arabia even as they pushed back on Riyadh’s behalf against certain safeguards, the reports said. Known as the “Gold Standard”, the safeguards are designed to prevent nuclear weapons development. IP3 called the standard a “total roadblock”, Monday’s report said.A Barrack spokesman said the billionaire had been cooperating with the oversight committee and had provided it with requested documents. Barrack’s investments and business development in the region were for a “better aligned Middle East”, he said. “This is not political, it is essential.“The White House and IP3 did not immediately respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6415afac7503de19ec6298e8ff00c828ecef9c0/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b38790d71a00411b708830c6bac5b289","title":"tuesday briefing not my labour any more says campbell","story":"‘The party no longer truly represents my values or hopes for Britain’ … therapy to reduce insomnia works … and the wild boar invading citiesGood morning – I’m Warren Murray, let’s get your day started.The Economist’s Anne McElvoy, who has been touring Europe for a BBC Radio 4 documentary, writes for the  today that “the timeline and the ‘Boris factor’ are changing the calculation on the continent” around how to handle the threat of no deal. “Now there’s a growing realisation that parliament may not reject this option, and that Brussels will have to face up to the prospect.” As the country heads towards the 31 October deadline, the  has analysed the previous stated positions of some of the key players in the Vote Leave camp.

From Barack Obama to “the Squad” and others, Sabrina Siddiqui, one of our reporting team in Washington, lists some of the prominent political leaders of colour whom Trump has singled out for attack in highly personalised ways.Jamie Grierson writes that with violent crime up and and the proportion of cases solved falling, the Tories’ claim to be the party of law and order is under threat.

Global Witness says 164 defenders were killed across the world in 2018 for standing up to miners, loggers, farmers, poachers and other industries. In the Philippines, 30 were killed in 2018, with half of the deaths related to agribusiness. Globally, mining was the sector responsible for the most killings – 43. But the sharpest rise was in murders of people trying to protect water sources, which increased from four to 17.In 2014 Carl Beech claimed he had been a victim of child sexual abuse by high-profile politicians.

Photograph: Aidan Crawley The taxpayer subsidised private schools by more than €90 million last year, according to official figures.The vast bulk of this sum went on salaries for teachers in the State’s 51 fee-paying schools, along with capital expenditure, grants for computer equipment and sports facilities.The figures come at a time when day pupil numbers in fee-paying schools are returning to levels last seen before the recession.Latest official enrolment statistics for the 2018-19 academic year show numbers attending private schools climbed to more than 25,600 pupils, up by almost 500 pupils on the previous year.While numbers slipped during the recession, with some private schools opting to enter the free education scheme, enrolments in the fee-paying sector have been growing steadily for the past four years.Most private schools in the south Dublin area are over-subscribed and have long waiting lists for day pupils.St Columba’s is the most expensive school for day pupils (€8,000), followed by Sutton Park in Dublin 13 (€7,900), Alexandra College, Dublin 6 (€7,386), St Gerard’s, Bray (€7,339) and Sandford Park (€7,150).Department of Education figures show that during 2018, the State paid just over €91 million on salaries for teachers employed in fee-paying schools.In addition, captial expenditure funding, ICT and sports grants for private schools amounted to more than €1 million.State subsidies for fee-paying schools were reduced during austerity era cost-cutting which saw these schools given an inferior pupil-teacher ratio (23:1) compared with schools in the free scheme (19:1).This was on the basis that private schools could use their own resources to hire additional subject teachers or ancillary staff.A report commissioned by the then minister for education Ruairí Quinn into the income of private schools, published in 2013, estimated that they had more than €80 million extra a year to invest in additional support and facilities for their pupils thanks to the income from fees.While there have been calls from the Labour Party for State funding of teachers’ salaries in private schools to cease, a spokeswoman for the Department of Education estimated this would end up costing the taxpayer at least €23 million.This would be as a result of some private schools opting to enter the free scheme and becoming entitled to State capitation grants and better pupil-teacher ratios.‘Day boarding’ optionsWhile day pupil numbers are growing, the number of boarding pupils dipped last year with just over 3,500 boarders recorded, down almost 90 on last year. This may be linked to a growth in new “day boarding” options, where students avail of meals and supervised study before returning home.In Glenstal Abbey School in Limerick, for example, boarding numbers fell by 60 over the past year. However, its day pupil numbers rose from zero to 68.In all, about 25 secondary schools now provide boarding options. They include schools which used to be fee-paying but joined the free education scheme during the economic downturn, such as Kilkenny College. The most expensive boarding school this year remains St Columba’s in Whitechurch, Dublin, which charges up to €22,800 a year.The next most expensive boarding schools are at Clongowes in Co Kildare (€19,890), Glenstal Abbey, Co Limerick (€19,300) and Rathdown School, Co Dublin (€19,275).Kilkenny College is the biggest boarding school in the country (438 boarders), followed by Clongowes Wood College, Co Kildare (433 pupils) and the King’s Hospital, Dublin (277).Fees for Irish private schools are highly competitive compared with the UK, where charges are typically several times higher.This is due partly to the fact that the salaries of most teachers in Irish private schools are paid for out of the public purse unlike the UK.The largest fee-paying schools are mostly Dublin-based and include Blackrock College (1,018 pupils), followed by Belvedere College (1,004), St Andrew’s (988) and Wesley (914). Christian Brothers College in Cork (904) is the largest outside Dublin."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3971136.1564427969!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin motorists face 3km diversion under city bus plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tView of Stoneybatter.

Enhanced cycle lanes are also proposed.However, to implement these changes, private cars would need to be restricted.Southbound traffic from the North Circular Road would be restricted to local access only on Prussia Street, to access the Park shopping centre or streets such as St Joseph’s Road with “no direct access to Stoneybatter”.Access to Stoneybatter from North Circular Road direction would be via Infirmary Road, Parkgate Street, North Quays and Blackhall Place – a detour of almost 3km.Motorists travelling north through Stoneybatter from the quays will have to turn left onto Aughrim Street, which will become a one-way street.‘Welcome improvements’Labour councillor and chairman of Stoneybatter Pride of Place Joe Costello said while there had been “welcome improvements”, a lot of issues remained unresolved.“There are quite a few areas that need clarification: funnelling all the car traffic coming from town into Aughrim Street poses a problem similarly, there are clarifications needed in relation to St Joseph’s Road.”Dublin City Council had previously considered making Aughrim Street one way but abandoned the idea because of the problems it would cause for residents, he said.BusConnects was “the right idea” Mr Costello said, but a more holistic traffic and transport plan needed to be put in place for it to work.“Park and ride facilities at rail hubs, and congestion charges need to be looked at to take the burden of commuter traffic off little villages. Otherwise there is a danger of unintended consequences, of creating traffic bottlenecks and rat runs.”Seaneen Sullivan, co-owner of local pub and restaurant L Mulligan Grocers, said the new designs represented a “huge improvement”.“The NTA have shown a willingness to listen. I would still love to see greater protection of cyclists, but from where we were, this is a huge step forward.”The community had been misunderstood as being opposed to BusConnects, she said. “As a community we are very pro-public transport. If you travel by private car, yes this will involve a detour, but this is a community with low levels of car ownership.”The NTA will be holding a new round of public consultation on its BusConnects programme in the autumn."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3971108.1564468583!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"retrieval of thalidomide documents could cost almost 170m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBoth sides have been ordered by Mr Justice Seamus Noonan to meet again this week in an attempt to resolve the issues.The Department of Health is trying to block a High Court order that it hand over documents relating to 33 thalidomide survivors, suggesting it could cost almost €170 million and take years to retrieve the records.Patsy Carr, a principal officer in the department, said a request to disclose relevant records would involve a trawl through “at least 91 million inidual documents”.A separate search of the department’s shared drives, archive system and databases would be “extremely large indeed” and likely to involve “a minimum of an additional 10 million documents”.The claims are made in an affidavit in a compensation claim case taken by 26 of the survivors against the drug manufacturers, German firm Grunenthal GmbH, the Irish distributors, TP Whelehan Son \u0026amp Co, and the Ministers for Health and the Environment.In a case management hearing last year, the court was told the survivors had all the documents that were relevant to their case, which was handed over to them during a review by the State Claims Agency in 2010. The documents filled just six boxes, according to papers before the High Court.Thalidomide, which was launched as a sedative in Germany in 1957, is alleged to have caused deformities in unborn children when it was given to their pregnant mothers. The alleged wrongdoing dates back to the 1960s and the defendants deny all the claims.Defendants were ordered by the High Court in April to grant discovery, or disclosure, of documents relevant to the case.This is to include all correspondence with the Office of the Attorney General, the Departments of An Taoiseach and An Tánaiste, the Chief State Solicitor’s Office, the German government and all pharmaceutical companies.But the Department of Health said it “holds a very large number of documents” which relate to a government-funded settlement scheme for survivors which has operated since 1975.Restriction of disclosureIt has asked the High Court to restrict disclosure of documents only to those pre-dating the set-up of the scheme, which campaigners say was inadequate because it was presumed survivors would not live long.The request for records dating from after 1975 is “extreme and excessive”, Ms Carr said.A separate trawl of records indicated a potential cost of €250,000 for every 150,000 documents to be reviewed, she said, adding “that a review of approximately 91 million electronic documents would present very extreme problems in terms of time and cost”. Her calculations suggest it could cost as much as €168 million.Also suggesting a lengthy timeframe, she said a separate discovery project in different litigation involving the department “has taken two years to date and is not yet complete, despite a team of 14 documentary counsel working to review the documents in question”.But in a responding affidavit, one of the plaintiffs, Austin O’Carroll, said it was “difficult to understand” the claimed volume of records that need to be searched.“The number of acknowledged Thalidomide survivors – some of whom are deceased – is 33,” he stated.RelevanceThalidomide survivor Mr O’Carroll, a Paralympian sailor, doctor and father of two, said the “vast quantities” the department was referring to was in fact the “entirety” of all its records rather than those relevant to the case.Skilled IT staff could use technology to interrogate records to whittle them down to what was needed, he said, adding that it was “highly likely” advice and comments had been made on the thalidomide settlement since 1975. A meeting between legal teams for survivors and the department, which included IT experts, to try to resolve the claimed issues around the volume of documents was held on May 31st.According to Mr O’Carroll’s affidavit, the meeting could not proceed because the plaintiffs wanted it “on the record” while the department insisted it be held on a “without prejudice” basis.Last Wednesday, Mr Justice Seamus Noonan ordered both sides to meet again this week in an attempt to resolve the issues.Mr Justice Noonan has previously expressed his concern about “the slow pace” of the proceedings. Many of those bringing cases may not survive to see a trial, he has said."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Advertising from moneylenders should carry \u0026lsquohigh cost-loan\u0026rsquo warnings, SVP sayTwo men arrested after car stopped in Coolock at about 4am on TuesdayDepartment of Health trying to block a High Court order due to cost and time involvedImam says he had received warnings and was told to be carefulHSE still to allocate staffing budget for 20-bed hospice at University Hospital WaterfordSean Ryan was last seen near the Cliffs of Moher in September, 1998New plan involves a \u0027bus gate\u0027 on Prussia Street south of Park shopping centreLess car traffic will improve public realm, says NTAEx-Dell Computers employee imported high-quality cocaine, court papers claimBank to sell family home mortgages worth hundreds of millions of euroEnrolments in fee-paying schools return to boom-time levelsLouth FG TD says he does not believe Maria Bailey should stand for re-election for partyImam Noonan was warned that a group was planning an attack on the mosqueDepartment sought thousands in overpayments with having little or no documentationDublin-based non-EEA students will be able to renew registration online rather than queuingAntique dildo - believed to be the same sold in 2017 for \u0026euro3,200 - is purchased for a fifth of the priceFionn Ferreira from Ballydehob earns \u0026euro45,000 bursary at event in California\u0026lsquoWhat are the intentions of the government?\u0026rsquo asks Prof Philip Alston"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3971252.1564434229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"aib seeks ethical buyers for non performing loans","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAIB is 75 per cent owned by the taxpayer.AIB will seek expressions of interest from “ethical” finance houses and charities for a sale of family home mortgages worth hundreds of millions of euros.The bank, which is 75 per cent owned by the taxpayer, is weighed down by non-performing loans secured on primary homes, but any sale to a so-called vulture fund would provoke significant political backlash for the bank and the Government.Therefore, the bank has decided to approach alternative entities it sees as having the potential to purchase the loans. Prospective buyers are thought to include mortgage campaigner David Hall’s iCare Housing, which is registered as a charity Home4Life, a company established to use the State’s expanded mortgage-to-rent scheme and the Phoenix Project, which is backed by investor Arizun.Arrow Global, the UK debt investor which is being advised by Department of Finance’s former secretary general John Moran, is also likely to be interested in the proposal. The expression of interest is likely to issue in the next fortnight, but could be sent out as early as Wednesday.The common theme among the prospective buyers is that they would keep those whose mortgages they purchase in their homes.Another loan book saleSeparately, the bank is moving ahead with another loan book sale, although family home loans are not included in the deal, which has been code-named Project Alder.AIB, advised by KPMG, is likely to officially launch the process in the next three to four weeks, with a sale planned by the end of the year. Between €800 million and €1 billion in loans were earmarked for the sale, sources said. In a statement, AIB said it had reduced non-performing exposures (NPEs) “from €31 billion in 2013 to €4.7 billion. The vast majority of the reduction in NPEs has been achieved through working with customers. We remain focused on reducing non-performing loans to more normalised levels.“Supporting customers in difficulty remains a key priority for AIB and, where feasible, we will continue to implement sustainable solutions for customers who engage with the bank on a case-by-case basis.“AIB is acknowledged as having the widest range of customer solutions in Ireland, including mortgage to rent and our joint initiative with iCare Housing, a not-for-profit approved housing body. We continue to explore other options which could enhance the solutions available to our customers.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3971149.1564428793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ombudsman says welfare files did not explain repayment demands","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Ombudsman said that on some occasions an inidual who may have been unaware of an overpayment demand  only realised it was outstanding when they began to draw down their State pension. Photograph: Getty ImagesThe Department of Social Protection pursued people for thousands of euro in overpayments despite having little or no documentation to justify the demand for repayment, a report by the Ombudsman has found.In one instance, a man was asked to pay back €17,000, but when he sought his file under Freedom of Information legislation, he was told it had been “purged”. Later the department told Ombudsman Peter Tyndall that “it could not locate the file and it could not provide evidence to support a decision that an overpayment exists”.A random sample of files reviewed by the Ombudsman’s office showed that many lacked clear explanations for a decision, or enough detail around calculation of the overpayment raised, or were missing correspondence relevant to the decision.Of the cases examined, almost half “were identified as having concerns which cast doubt on the department’s justification in recovering the overpayments raised against the claimants”. The department has far-reaching powers to recover overpaid social welfare allowances, which allow it to pursue cases even after the statute of limitations which would prevent it from lodging a court case has expired. It can also attach payment orders to a person’s social welfare payment, including their State pension. The Ombudsman said that on some occasions an inidual who may have been unaware of an overpayment demand, only realised it was outstanding when they began to draw down their State pension. Given the strength of the department’s powers, Mr Tyndall argued that it had a particular obligation to ensure principles of fairness and natural justice were observed. The department was criticised over its failure to routinely inform a person who was the subject of a repayment order that it existed, leading many people to wrongly assume that overpayments which they had disputed years or decades ago had been written off by the department.Many of the cases reviewed also did not contain evidence that claimants were informed of their right of appeal when they were notified of a revised decision in their case. Inidual cases reviewed “gave rise to concerns that the department was not always using its powers in an appropriate manner”, and that on occasion “there was a failure by inidual decision-makers to adhere to the guidance in a consistent and proper manner”.“In most case files examined there was an absence of key supporting documentation relating to the recovery of overpayments. The examination also raised worrying questions about the propriety of pursuing overpayments in several of the cases selected.”Mr Tyndall told The  he first became concerned about the issue in 2015, when his office noticed that a much higher level of complaints were being upheld in relation to overpayments issues than was the case across the entire body of complaints relating to the department. Around 50 per cent of complaints were being upheld at the time, he said. Mr Tyndall said the pursuit of overpayments was ramped up during the recession when “people were under pressure to bring in any income that was due to the State”. He said the department should have provided more clear guidelines to staff who were asked to pursue cases. “When you switch to a more vigorous approach you need to be providing guidelines and training for staff.” He said in some instances the department was looking to reclaim sums that dated back to the 1990s or even earlier, which were later lost. Despite the findings, Mr Tyndall stressed that the department had been co-operative with the Ombudsman’s office, and had undertaken to put in place reforms aimed at tackling the shortcomings identified, which he said was laudable. “The Department has responded well to our request for change most concerns relate to issues raised in the past.” The department sought a payment of €17,000 from a man dating back to the period 1998 to 2000. He had received no notification of the outstanding overpayment from the department in the intervening period, and was only notified when he applied for an invalidity pension.When he sought his file under Freedom of Information legislation, he was told it had been “purged”. The department later told the Ombudsman’s office that it could not find the file and had no evidence to support a decision that an overpayment existed. It agreed to write off the overpayment.A man received a letter from the department in 2011 arguing that he owed €10,000 in overpayments in respect of Job Seeker’s Allowance. He said that he had supplied the department with all information it sought from him, including pay slips relating to his wife’s maternity leave, but that it had lost the information on at least three occasions.He queried his payment as it seemed too high, but the department assured him it was correct. The department also failed to respond to phone calls, emails and other communications from the man on multiple occasions. Following the complaint to the Ombudsman, the department cancelled the overpayment and refunded the amount it had already recovered.

Jaden, 15, will share £1.8m with his playing partnerThe mother of a British schoolboy who won almost £1 million in the Fortnite World Cup has said that she tried to hard to stop him from playing the game that she threw out his Xbox and snapped his headset.Jaden  Ashman, 15, will split £1.8 million in prize money with his Dutch team-mate after winning second place in the Fortnite duos competition at the Athur Ashe stadium in New York City, which traditionally hosts the US Open tennis tournament.The teenager from Essex, who competes under the name Wolfiez, was among 100 Fortnite players who qualified for the game\u0027s first ever world cup, in which a total of more than £24 million is up for grabs with a top inidual prize of £2.4 million.But his mother, Lisa Dallman, said she didn\u0027t really know much about video games and had struggled to accept that his skill at Fortnite was more than a frivolous waste of time.It\u0027s not been a straightfoward journey with Jordan, Ms Dallman told BBC Five Live. If I\u0027m honest with you, I\u0027ve been quite against him gaming. I\u0027ve been more pushing him to his schoolwork. I\u0027ve actually thrown an Xbox out, snapped a headset, we\u0027ve had a nightmare.Leading up to the game, getting his visa, we had problems with that... then the dog ate his birth certificate. Then work messed up my wages. So three things went wrong before we started heading here.I had a feeling that Jaden was going to place top 10... he\u0027s come 2nd and I can\u0027t believe it.More than 100 players representing more than 30 countries competed in Fortnite\u0027s first World Cup, which is attempting to turn the game\u0027s massive international popularity into a glitzy competitive sport. The £24m prize pool is currently the biggest ever offered for any eSports event, though it is likely to be surpassed by the Dota 2 International in August.Ashman surprised many fans on Saturday by winning second place by using a joypad rather than a keyboard and mouse, which allow for finer control.Me and my mum, we clash quite a lot, he said after the tournament. She didn\u0027t understand how it worked, so she thought that I was spending eight hours a day in my room just wasting my time. Mow that I\u0027ve proved to her that I can do stuff, I\u0027m really happy.Other Brits also placed well in the duos tournament. Kyle Mongraal Jackson, 14, who became the youngest ever eSports player when he was recruited by a team aged 13, won half of £363,000 with 6th place, while Mac Itemm Gillivray came just behind him at 8th place.Altogether, British players won almost $1.4 million, with more money likely to flow from the singles tournament, in which Jackson and his fellow Brit Benjy David Fish (Benjyfishy) are tipped to place well. The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

And Twitch, like all apps that allow two-way communication and live streaming, present particular risks to children of being groomed.“These sites need to ensure they are doing everything they can to protect children on their platforms.A Twitch spokesman said: The safety of our community is a top priority and one in which we are perpetually investing.We take any issues or accusations of this nature extremely seriously, and as soon as we become aware of a possible instance of exploitation we swiftly take the content down and report it to relevant law enforcement as appropriate.  The NSPCC’s warning comes as it released the results of a survey of 2,000 11 to 17-year-olds that found one in 25 has received or been asked to send sexual material to an adult online.When compared to the population of more than five million children in the UK of that age, the NSPCC estimates this means up to 201,000 are being subject to attempted grooming. According to the survey, the most common social media sites where children experienced grooming were Snapchat and Facebook, where one in 25 using those networks said they had received such requests.The second most common sites were Twitch and Twitter, with one in 33 reporting having such experiences.As a result, the charity called called for social media and tech companies to share more data with each help catch groomers and disable friend suggestion algorithms for children.Duty of Care campaign | Read morePeter Wanless, NSPCC Chief Executive, said: “The scale of risk that children face on social networks revealed in this research cannot be ignored and tackling it with robust and comprehensive legislation needs to be a priority for this government.   “Tech firms need to be forced to get a grip of the abuse taking place on their sites by using technology to identify suspicious behaviour and designing young people’s accounts with built-in protections.”Following the findings, Antigone Davis, Facebook Head of Global Safety, said: “Keeping young people safe on our platforms is a top priority for us.“In addition to using technology to proactively detect grooming and prevent child sexual exploitation on our platform, we work with child protection experts, including specialist law enforcement teams like CEOP in the UK, to keep young people safe.“Ninety nine percent of child nudity content is removed from our platform automatically.”A spokesman for Snapchat added: “We are concerned that predators are using other, less private, apps to locate potential victims and then steer them to Snapchat or other private messaging platforms. We are working hard to better understand this activity and are collaborating with law enforcement and other industry partners to develop more ways to combat this behaviour.”A spokesman for Twitter said: “Twitter does not tolerate any material that features or promotes child sexual exploitation. Under our child sexual exploitation policy, behaviours such as expressing a desire to obtain materials that feature child sexual exploitation as well as engaging or trying to engage a child in a sexually explicit conversation, are in violation. “We continue to welcome partnerships around the world with law enforcement to continue our rigorous and significantly scaled operations on this type of egregious activity.”Duty of Care CampaignThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

When the Romans captured Jerusalem in 63BC, or so says Tacitus, Pompey marched into the inner sanctum of the Jewish Temple and found it empty. No idols, no treasures, just God. To be in His presence was the greatest bounty.If Pompey besieged Rochester Cathedral today, what would he find inside? A miniature golf course. No joke. Located in the nave, this summer installation consists of nine holes with models of bridges – justified by the kind of silliness that parts of the Anglican Church have become famous for. “We hope,” says the Rev Canon Rachel Phillips, “while playing adventure golf, visitors will reflect on the bridges that need to be built in their own lives and in our world today.” Because contemplating the brotherhood of man is what we all do when playing mini-golf at the sea side. I believe Karl Marx composed Das Kapital at a Butlins in Skegness. No mean feat when trying to putt with one hand and eat a raspberry ripple with the other.But Rochester isn’t alone! If Pompey’s pagan army is travelling north, it’ll feel right at home at Peterborough Cathedral, where they’re doing “Creative Yoga” under a giant model of the planet Earth, titled “Gaia”. Or kick off your sandals at Norwich Cathedral which is installing a 50ft helter skelter that “aims to give people the chance to experience the Cathedral in an entirely new way and open up conversations about faith.”Again the same theo-mumbo justification that betrays no understanding whatsoever of basic human psychology. To paraphrase: “it will attract people who would never normally go to the church.” Yes dear, and they’ll never come back. Because what you’re offering the visitor isn’t Christianity, it’s an afternoon’s distraction, so what would make them want to return at 10am on a Sunday morning? Unless you’re planning to replace Holy Communion with tango lessons, you’ll never see these feckless punters ever again.I don’t normally like to comment on Anglicanism. I’m a convert to Catholicism so it can sound like sectarian snobbery – unwarranted because the Catholic Church can be just as tasteless, albeit in a less imaginative way. A lot of our bishops seem to think time stopped in 1965. They’re still building churches that have all the aesthetic beauty of an East German car park.But what the Anglicans do matters to all of us because, first, they are the curators for our national spiritual heritage and, second, they’re ahead of the curve in the decline of Christianity. Where they go, the elites of other congregations usually follow.The Anglican leadership has fallen into the trap of thinking that the purpose of a church is to serve man without asking anything in return. If a cathedral is empty or silent, that’s a problem because, by implication, it’s not full of human beings having a jolly good time. And if people want frivolity, give ‘em that. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more Christianity is downgraded to the status of a curiosity on the margins of public life, the more the public will assume it’s just an irrelevant novelty. This death spiral is implicit in the mission statement of the holy helter skelter of Norwich. The Rev Canon Andy Bryant says his Cathedral “invites but never seeks to impose”.That’s utter tosh. Christianity imposes a lot. It’s the things that it demanded of its earliest followers – chastity, obedience, equality and, ultimately, self-sacrifice – that made it stand out from the here-today-gone-tomorrow cults of the Roman era. It has lasted this long because St Paul grasped that human beings will only give of themselves if they are asked to, and the more you demand, the more people will do because they are, at heart, intelligent and good.Christianity insists that its followers keep the Lord’s day and worship as often as possible: it doesn’t say, turn up once a summer with a yoga mat if you feel like it. In that spirit, cathedrals were designed precisely to remind you of your place in this celestial order, to make you feel small, to awe you into belief. When you stick a mini golf course in a cathedral, it doesn’t bring the community closer so much as it strips the building of its original intent and pushes God further away. It is an act of desecration.Christian clerics – of all denominations – are achieving something the Romans never could. They are making the faith look ridiculous. If the modern world hates Christianity then I’m fine with that: it’s part of our history, par for the course. It shows that we stand for something profound enough to inspire emotion. The moment the world starts laughing at us, however, we’re doomed. It means we’re empty in the worst possible sense: we don’t stand for anything. We’re just bricks and mortar with a fun fair inside.The sad irony is that if there’s one aspect of Anglican spirituality I rate, it’s the quietness – that overwhelming sense of peace one finds in the silence at the end of Evensong, when the cavernous church stops to reflect, before shuffling off to dinner. Then, like the tomb of Christ, the sanctum is empty – but for you, the mice and the architect of the universe.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

In the past year alone, there has been a 12 per cent rise.  Ministers have previously warned that universities which hand out soaring numbers of unconditional offers are “undermining the credibility of higher education” and urged them to rein in the practice.Universities have been accused of acting in a “completely irresponsible” manner by handing out so many unconditional offers.Earlier this year the higher education watchdog warned institutions against handing out “incentivised” offers, where they tell students their offer will be unconditional - but only if they accept it as their first choice university.The Office for Students (OfS) said that applying “psychological pressure” or “creating an impression of urgency” in applicants\u0027 decision making could be a potential breach of consumer protection law.Despite the intervention, the proportion of such offers also increased and now makes up 8.3 per cent of all offers, up from 6.6 per cent last year.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said that universities are playing a “dangerous game” by ignoring the regulator\u0027s and ministers\u0027 warning over unconditional offers, adding that this may prove to be the “straw that breaks the camel’s back” for autonomy.  “The only way to tackle the issue seriously is by collective action,” he said. “Given all the warnings in the past, one might have expected last year to be the turning point for unconditional offers. I think this will lead to a big new row about university autonomy”.The OfS published a report in January that examined the impact of unconditional offers on students’ decision making. It found that applicants who accept an unconditional offer are more likely to miss their predicted A-level grades by two or more grades.Chris Millward, director for fair access and participation at the OfS, said he is concerned about the “significant growth” in unconditional offers revealed by the figures.“We will be monitoring data on the link between unconditional offers, the grades students achieve and their retention in higher education,” he said.  “Where we see evidence that the use of unconditional offers has a negative impact on student outcomes of this kind, we will investigate and stand ready to intervene.”The OfS is to launch a major review later this year into the university admissions system, which could see the system overhauled so students only apply after they have their A-level grades.Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said that they are also carrying out an admissions review to ensure offer making practices are “fair and transparent, underpinned by clear criteria and operating in the best interests of students”.He said that there are “clear benefits” in universities using a variety of different offers, adding: “An important principle of the UK system is that universities decide independently which students they accept.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Today, not so muchRetail and Consumer industryJobs and employmentDown at the dockside in Grimsby, the smell of fish hangs in the air like a memory. Fish bones lie discarded, a reminder of the once booming fishing industry, which has now all but gone from this Lincolnshire town.Towards the end of last year, Grimsby received the dubious honour of being singled out as having the unhealthiest high street in the country. In a league table compiled by the Royal Society for Public Health, it was rated based on its number of payday lenders, bookmakers, tanning salons and fast food outlets (unhealthy) and its number of pubs and bars, libraries and museums, pharmacies, dentists, opticians and leisure centres (healthy). Its poor performance on these metrics followed a report from PwC earlier in the year that found it had one of the worst-affected town centres for shop closures in 2017. According to figures compiled by the Local Data Company, while six new retail businesses had opened in Grimsby that year, another 16 had shut down. \u0026#39This used to be a very busy street\u0026#39 - Freeman Street in Grimsby, which has Britain\u0026#39s \u0026#39unhealthiest\u0026#39 high streetIn the third part of our series on the state of the high street, we explore why Grimsby has been struggling, and what is being done to try and turn things around. And the story begins with fishing, a line of work that once provided the town’s raison d’ê​tre. By the middle of the 20th century, Grimsby had become the biggest fishing port in the world, providing employment – and a strong sense of identity – to its denizens. In the industry’s heyday, the main thoroughfare near the docks, Freeman Street, was buzzing. Today, not so much. “This used to be a very busy street,” says Steve Beasant, a Liberal Democrat councillor who represents the East Marsh ward in which Freeman Street sits. “The fishing industry was like a millionaire’s paradise.”The Enrolled Freemen of Grimsby have bought and started to demolish a section of this artery, so it can be regenerated. Stephen White, their director, remembers a once thriving high street. “When the bus used to stop at Marks \u0026amp Spencer and people got off, the traffic had to stop because they were all to and fro over the road, it was teeming with people,” he says wistfully.Dotted between businesses are empty units in varying states of disrepairThere is no Marks \u0026amp Spencer on Freeman Street now. There are a number of small, independent businesses, but dotted between them sit plenty of empty units in varying states of disrepair: a bed shop that shut about five years ago (“We went in and the place had been trashed,” says White) a pub called The White Bear a specialist gas appliance centre, which now has holes in the roof and a shuttered pine furniture shop with a broken sign. A 1960s office block has sat empty on the street for more than five years. Today it is boarded up and has been vandalised. Set back from the road is a patch of empty land where some flats have been razed to the ground, their inhabitants dispersed elsewhere. This had a knock-on effect on the health of the shopping street, scattering those who once bought here.But the problems go deeper. Following the death of the fishing industry – which some date to the cod wars of the 1970s and others blame on the EU common fisheries policy that introduced strict catch quotas to preserve stock – the town hasn’t fully recovered.Grimsby in numbersAlthough it has a food packaging industry and a growing renewable energy sector, there have also been generations out of work in former fishing families. In the 2016 EU referendum, almost 70 per cent of voters in North East Lincolnshire backed Brexit.“You’d follow your father into fishing, so once that stopped, the sons didn’t find work and we’re now in the third generation unemployed in a lot of cases,” says White.Over in the area they call Top Town, a 20-minute walk westwards from Freeman Street, the retail scene looks more like the average British high street. A number of shops have disappeared, but multiple chain stores still trade here (including M\u0026ampS), and on a weekday lunchtime, the precincts are busy. Still, many local shoppers feel the town has seen better days.Grimsby was named \u0026#39unhealthiest high street\u0026#39 due to its number of \u0026#39unhealthy\u0026#39 outlets such as betting shops“The shopping here is a bit poor,” says Lisa Hallett, a restaurant worker from nearby Cleethorpes. “All the shops are shutting down. If you want to buy anything, you’re better going online. We’ve got lazy. You just press a button, don’t you? And unfortunately the rents are high for little shops.”The problem of high rents for commercial properties is not just confined to Grimsby, of course. Nor is the complaint of local pensioner Janice Fell, 67, who has “good memories of retail here.” Today, she says, “you feel nobody wants you. They’re not bothered if you buy or don’t buy.”Her remark captures the sense that retailers need to work harder to pull through the doors consumers who might otherwise shop online.But Melanie Onn, Labour MP for Great Grimsby, says Freshney Place, the main shopping centre, has worked hard to encourage more independent retailers, offering good deals on rent. Money has been spent on new bathrooms and tiling – seemingly small gestures that nonetheless add to the lustre of a public space – and non-retail activities to encourage families. (At Easter the centre played host to a petting farm, face painting and a craft event.) The town at the end of the \u0026#39railway to nowhere\u0026#39, as it\u0026#39s been describedAnother boost came in January, when Grimsby was awarded more than £3 million from the Government’s Cultural Development Fund. The money will help finance a programme of events in the area, with the aim of attracting new visitors and investment. New public art and cultural spaces will help regenerate historic parts of the town, while support will be offered to local enterprises in the cultural sector and iniduals with a business idea. It is hoped the funding will generate further new jobs and increase town centre footfall. “It has the opportunity to be very exciting,” says Onn.Cllr Beasant agrees. “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to really make something of Grimsby.”Stephen White (right) and Cllr Stephen Beasant are committed to regenerating the East Marsh areaBack on his own ward, there has been some progress. In Freeman Street Market, which dates from 1883, traders who cleared out some years back have been replaced by craft businesses, a printing shop and a dance school, among other things. More than a dozen business units now occupy the market’s mezzanine too, and, adds White, there are solar panels on the roof: “It’s the greenest market in the country!”  Less green, perhaps, is the free parking that has helped increase footfall at the market, while regeneration plans for Freeman Street include new office space, eco-friendly housing and possibly a hotel.“It’s a big challenge,” admits Onn. “But...people will see there’s life in Freeman Street. It’s an opportunity for a different kind of high street.” A record store, independent greengrocer and furniture store are among them already, “so there is hope,” she adds. Solutions for the futureUndeniably the town has received its fair share of knocks it has retained reasonable levels of morale, but “obviously a lot are worried about the future,” hazards Cllr Beasant, “and the political world is changing rapidly, so we just don’t know what’s around the corner.”Out on the street, Saskia Wilborne-Davy, 22, a civil servant, strikes a similarly equivocal note. “I’m proud to say I’m from here, but so much has been left to decay,” she says. “It’s not easy when money is so tight.”Next week: we visit Britain\u0027s healthiest high street Retail and Consumer industryJobs and employmentBrexit latest: Boris Johnson to unveil strategy to help farmers in Wales amid threats of \u0026#39civil unrest\u0026#39 if we leave with No DealBlack super new moon 2019: What is it and will we be able to see the lunar event in the UK?At least 18 killed as Pakistan army plane crashes into residential areaTrump claims he was \u0026#39down there\u0026#39 with first responders at September 11 attacksPut police in the dock over Nick investigation for \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39 searches of VIP homes, former judge saysUK weather: Prepare your homes for flooding, warns Met Office as sandbags handed out Comment: It\u0026#39s time to stop hounding ex-soldiers who served during the TroublesComment: One of the biggest Brexit prizes will be ditching the EU’s mindless precaution and innovation-crushing rules\tFoyle\u0026#39s War voted TV\u0026#39s most-missed show of the 21st century as top ten revealedCapital One data breach exposes more than 100 million customers in USChinese students are two years ahead of their white British peers by age 16, report findsChildren being groomed on popular livestreaming site Twitch, NSPCC research findsUniversities \u0026#39ignore warnings\u0026#39 as unconditional offers hit record highAlastair Campbell says he no longer wishes to be a Labour member in letter to Jeremy Corbyn Ethiopians plant more than 200 million trees in a single day in bid to restore landscapeDuchess of Sussex promises to swap \u0026#39superficial\u0026#39 fashion for \u0026#39internal beauty\u0026#39 in new deep VogueBoris Johnson to promise farmers a \u0026#39better deal\u0026#39 after BrexitFamily cries foul play as teen who accused Indian politician of rape battles for life after accidentPrisoners decapitated as 57 dead in Brazil prison riot Climate change blamed for deaths of 200 Arctic reindeerWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/08/15/iain-conn.jpg","title":"british gas centrica iain conn pay rise loss","story":"IM Subscribe NowIM Subscribe NowCreated with Sketch.IM  Subscribe NowIM  Subscribe NowSubscribe NowSubscribe NowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Try Independent Minds free for 1 monthSee the optionsEnergy chief executive has\u0026nbspslashed thousands of jobs, hiked prices and collected millions of pounds in payClick to followThe IndependentThe boss of British Gas owner Centrica is to step down next year after the utility firm reported a loss of £446m.Iain Conn will leave the UK’s largest gas supplier in 2020, having failed to stem outflows of hundreds of thousands of customers per year.The Centrica chief executive came under fire in April after receiving a 44 per cent pay rise to £2.4m - 120 times the earnings of a typical employee in the company’s customer service centre.Unions branded the pay rise “obscene”, pointing to the fact that during 2018 British Gas hiked energy prices twice, lost 742,000 customers and announced 4,000 job cuts. Mr Conn collected £1.7m in 2017 and £4m the year before.On Tuesday, Centrica\u0026nbspunveiled a statutory pre-tax loss of £446m in the six months to 30 June, compared to a £704m profit this time last year.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Theresa the robotic waitress at The Tea Terrace\u0027s Cobham branch in Surrey.

Only Npower, with 30 per cent, scored lower among the UK\u0027s six largest energy suppliers.In February, British Gas blamed the government’s energy price cap as it warned that profits would be lower than forecast.Under the cap, Ofgem sets an upper limit for the annual cost of gas and electricity on so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs).SVTs are often the default deal that companies switch customers onto after their initial tariff period comes to an end. However they are also among the most expensive deals available, prompting accusations from consumer groups that loyal customers are being exploited.“Centrica’s calamitous financial results come as no surprise to GMB and the announcement to cut another £250m and slash yet more jobs is not the answer - you cannot just cut your way out of crisis.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The building is gigantic, geometrically solid and powerfully symmetrical, while the tiny man slouches, humanly imperfect and asymmetricalThe play on words for this new development is a footer to the town’s skyline, along which run the grey heights of a multi-storey carpark, Chapel Street Church spire, and the faint tops of housesI’m led into the train station by a man on his mobility scooter. I photograph him and his sign, then take the train to Preston. I thought it was strange how someone could be so proud of a city, with all its details and complexitiesIt’s one of the sickly contradictions of advertising: you can save money by spending it. Here it is presented as the headline of Bolton market, put so simply, yet still so complicatedWhen people stop to speak to rough sleepers it always looks so unbalanced. The different social positions of the interaction are exaggerated by the visual dimensions, with passer-by almost always standing above, leaning over, talking downLast month PSA said its next generation of the Astra would be built from 2021 at Russelsheim in Germany and Ellesmere Port in Cheshire,\u0026nbspbut warned this was “conditional” on a satisfactory\u0026nbspBrexit deal.The car manufacturer has now gone further by suggesting it could pull out of Ellesmere Port, which could spell the end of the plant.Vauxhall Astra to be built in UK, but only if no-deal Brexit avoided“Frankly I would prefer to put it in Ellesmere Port but if the conditions are bad and I cannot make it profitable then I have to protect the rest of the company,” said Mr Tavares. “We have an alternative to Ellesmere Port.”The threat to move production follows Friday’s warning from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders that a no-deal Brexit was an “existential threat” to the industry.Vauxhall, which was owned by US carmaker General Motors before being bought by PSA in 2017, launched an ad campaign for the Astra last year that billed its bestselling model as “true Brit”, on the basis that versions of the car have been built at Ellesmere Port for over 40 years.The Cheshire plant still employs 1,000-plus workers despite more than 650 job cuts\u0026nbspsince last year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But rudderless Just Eat needs this as Amazon and Uber move inClick to followThe IndependentJust Eat told its noisy shareholders that a merger with Dutch rival Takeaway wasn’t on the menu when it updated the market in March. Now there’s a deal between the two at the door and steam is coming off the shares.\u0026nbspReports of something in the offing started doing the rounds at the end of last week. This morning the terms were announced. That’s some smart delivering.\u0026nbspWhat’s being served up is an all share tie up in which the two sides, who said no no no when activist investor Cat Rock Capital started banging the table and demanding something be done just a few short months ago, theoretically sharing the spoils.\u0026nbspJust Eat to publish hygiene ratings for every takeaway on appRestaurants on Just Eat giving ‘life-threatening allergen information’So Just Eat gets to fill the positions of chairman and the finance director, while the shares will have a premium listing in London. But Takeaway\u0027s youthful CEO Jitse Groen will run the business, which will be headquartered and domiciled in the Netherlands under the Dutch corporate structure.\u0026nbspHis colleagues are slated to hold two of the other three top executive positions.\u0026nbspTakeaway, a significantly smaller business in terms of number of orders, earnings and revenues, is clearly the winner. It’s eating its rival.\u0026nbspThis is a takeover in everything but name.Just Eat’s investors could scarcely be happier about that. The shares shot up by 25 per cent. Compare that to Takeawawy, which put something more like 3.5 per cent despite apparently getting the better of the deal.Part of the discrepancy can be explained by speculation that a counter bid may emerge for Just Eat, and it’s a realistic possibility. Partly it’s because Groen is well regarded and the deal gets Just Eat out of a real hole.It was much criticised for under delivering under former boss Peter Plumb. When his acting replacement Peter Duffy made it clear he didn’t want the job on the permanent basis, it wasn’t altogether clear where the company would turn (other than to Groen).\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

White\u0027s goal was England\u0027s second of the match, which they went on to win 2-1Adjusted revenue dropped 2 per cent to £13.8bn, while underlying earnings fell 19 per cent to £1.1bn.Centrica said it would ramp up its cost-saving plans from £750m to £1bn, slash its shareholder idend\u0026nbspand exit the oil and gas production business.The sale of its production business, Spirit Energy, marks the latest move to refocus the company as consumer-facing.During his tumultuous tenure, Mr Conn has sold off power plants and wind farms in order to concentrate on supplying energy to retail customers.But hundreds of thousands of customers have erted Centrica\u0027s\u0026nbspretail energy supplier, British Gas, as competition has heated up in the sector.British Gas investors urged to reject CEO’s ‘obscene’ £2.4m pay checkJust 32 per cent of British Gas customers said they would recommend the supplier to others, according to a February 2018 poll by\u0026nbspenergy regulator Ofgem. Only Npower, with 30 per cent, scored lower among the UK\u0027s six largest energy suppliers.In February, British Gas blamed the government’s energy price cap as it warned that profits would be lower than forecast.Under the cap, Ofgem sets an upper limit for the annual cost of gas and electricity on so-called standard variable tariffs (SVTs).SVTs are often the default deal that companies switch customers onto after their initial tariff period comes to an end. However they are also among the most expensive deals available, prompting accusations from consumer groups that loyal customers are being exploited.“Centrica’s calamitous financial results come as no surprise to GMB and the announcement to cut another £250m and slash yet more jobs is not the answer - you cannot just cut your way out of crisis.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

White\u0027s goal was England\u0027s second of the match, which they went on to win 2-1In 2018, when English and maths GCSE results were\u0026nbspcompared, poorer students were 18.1 months behind in terms of attainment – widening by 0.2 months since 2017.The report found that the most persistently disadvantaged pupils, those eligible for free school meals for most of their school lives, are nearly two years (22.6 months) behind at the end of their GCSEs – and that gap has increased by 0.4 months since 2011.Researchers say “austerity measures” are partly to blame for the widening of the gap at GCSE.However, primary schools continued to narrow the gap by 0.3 months between 2017 and 2018.David Laws, executive chairman of EPI and former Liberal Democrat schools minister, said the report should be a “wake-up call” for the new prime minister.He said: “We are now witnessing a major setback for social mobility in our country. Recent progress on narrowing the education gap between poor children and the rest has ground to a halt.Thousands of heads to march on Downing Street demanding more cash“The very poorest children are actually further behind now than they were a decade ago – they are almost two years of learning on average behind other children by the time they take their GCSEs.“Educational inequality on this scale is bad for both social mobility and economic productivity.”Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: “This report makes for grim reading and should be sounding alarm bells in Whitehall.“The fact that the gap in GCSE attainment between disadvantaged students and their peers has not only stalled but widened slightly is likely to be the result of severe financial pressures which have forced schools to cut back on the inidual support they are able to provide to students, as well as cuts to local services for vulnerable families and young people.”Nick Gibb, the school standards minister, said the gap between disadvantaged pupils and their peers had “narrowed considerably” in both primary and secondary in recent years.He added: “We are investing £2.4bn this year alone through the pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged children.“Teachers and school leaders are helping to drive up standards right across the country, with 85 per cent of children now in good or outstanding schools compared to just 66 per cent in 2010, but there is more to do to continue to attract and retain talented iniduals in our classrooms.”North of England\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As per tradition, one half of the couple was asked to choose whether to take the money for themselves or split it with their partner -- Greg chose to split the £50,000 winnings with Amber.The liveblog is now closedCatch-up: Anton and Belle left the villa last night in final dumping of the showFind out what to expect from tonight\u0027s episode in our previewSee the biggest moments from this series of Love IslandGood evening, and welcome to The Independent\u0027s liveblog of the Love Island final!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt\u0027s going to be an emotional one, not least because I\u0027m so overjoyed at the thought of finally having free evenings each night.

One of those, the furthest from the star, is thought to sit in the temperature range that could allow it to support alien life – but its atmosphere is expected to be so thick and dense that it stores lots of heat, and the surface is probably too warm.Scientists hope to learn more about the relatively nearby worlds. As well as being close by and playing host to such unusual worlds, the star is unusually bright, without the solar flares and storms that can sometimes get in the way of observations.“TOI-270\u0026nbspis a true Disneyland for exoplanet science, and one of the prime systems\u0026nbspTESS\u0026nbspwas set out to discover,” Mr Gunther continued.NasaGoddard Space Flight CentreScott Wiessinger)“It is an exceptional laboratory for not one, but many reasons –\u0026nbspit really ticks all the boxes.”There might be yet more planets in this solar system waiting to be found, researchers said.While the planets are interesting enough in themselves, they also link together in a “resonant chain”, according to the researchers who found them. That means that their orbits are lined up neatly in whole integers, meaning that they are in “resonance” with each other.“For\u0026nbspTOI-270, these planets line up like pearls on a string,” Mr Gunther\u0026nbspsaid. “That’s a very interesting thing, because it lets us study their dynamical\u0026nbspbehaviour. And you can almost expect, if there are more planets, the next one would be somewhere further out, at another integer ratio.”Other solar systems have been found with planets that line up in these “resonant” formations. In our solar system, the moons of Jupiter are lined up in this interesting way, too.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

An unusually high proportion of the fund has been invested in illiquid shares, meaning they could be subject to heavy discounts if a sale is required quickly.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

What details there are usually come through unconfirmed leaks and the companies officially stay silent on the phones until they are released to the public.But this time around, Google appears to be selectively leaking details of the phone in advance of its release. It has already shown off pictures of what it will look like, and has now shown two of its central features.Today we’re giving you an early look at the technology behind two new features coming to Pixel 4 that make your phone more helpful and represent a next step in our vision for ambient computing, it wrote in a blog post that showed off two of the technologies.The first of those features is a new tool called Soli, which it described as a motion-sending radar. That involved a tiny version of the technology used to spot planes, which can be used to sense how people move around the phone and use that to control it.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chief engineer of LIFT aircraft Balazs Kerulo demonstrates the company\u0027s Hexa personal drone craft in Lago Vista, Texas on June 3 2019225 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

Over time, new capabilities will come to the phone so that the feature – named Motion Sense by Google – can develop with new software.Such a feature had already been rumoured after some images of the outside of the phone had been leaked by third-parties. Those included a large hole in its front, which prompted speculation that it could fit the radar sensor used to power the Motion Sense feature.Google Pixel 4 leak shows hole for mysterious feature at top of phoneThe second feature is the ability for users to unlock their phone just by using their face. Such a feature is already available in products like the iPhone, but Google said it is engineering it differently.Unlike Apple\u0027s FaceID and other similar devices, Google claims the new phone will be able to use that motion sensing technology to see people are reaching down for the phone before they even touch it.

The measurements indicate the largest singular release of radioactivity from a civilian reprocessing plant,” said Georg Steinhauser, one of the lead researchers from the University of Hannover.The data was taken from 176 measuring stations in 29 countries. Despite the high concentration of radioactive material it was not harmful to human health anywhere in Europe, according to the paper published in scientific journal\u0026nbspPNAS.\u0026nbspGermany’s green power generates more electricity than coal and nuclearKim Jong-un inspects submarine ‘designed to deliver nuclear weapons’It is not the first time the Mayak plant has made headlines.\u0026nbspAlmost exactly 60 years earlier, in 1957, the site suffered the world’s second most serious nuclear incident after Chernobyl when a tank containing liquid waste from plutonium production exploded and contaminated the area.\u0026nbspIt led to the release of radiation over an area of over 20,000 square miles. The accident remained secret until 1976.Professor Steinhauser said “This time, however, it was a pulsed release that was over very quickly.“We were able to show that the accident occurred in the reprocessing of spent fuel elements, at a very advanced stage, shortly before the end of the process chain,” he said.\u0026nbspThe present-day Mayak plant has been a target for activists, who say managers have not learned the lessons of the 1957 disaster. They claim the\u0026nbspincreased production targets have come at the cost of safety.“Even though there is currently no official statement, we have a very good idea of what might have happened,” Professor Steinhauser said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She also talked about the trauma of getting pregnant and having a child, who is now four months old, as a result of the sexual assault.The British government was earlier this month ordered by the High Court\u0026nbspto help her return to the UK on the grounds that its decision to reject her asylum claim had been unlawful,\u0026nbspbecause it was reached by an unfair process which did not give her sufficient time to obtain evidence.She is one of thousands of asylum seekers whose immigration cases were decided under the Home Office’s “detained fast-track” system, which was introduced in 2005 and came to an end in 2015 after the High Court ruled that it was “structurally unfair”.Gay woman wrongly removed from UK ‘gang-raped and feared for her life’The Home Office had booked her\u0026nbsponto a flight just after 4am on Monday, but she\u0026nbspsaid that when she arrived at the check-in she was told she could not board without written evidence that she didn’t require a visa – which she had not been provided with.\u0026nbspThe department said it had been working urgently to resolve the matter and PN was due to board a later flight on Tuesday night.Speaking to The Independent, PN said: “They said I needed something to prove I had a visa waiver. But the High Commission and the Home Office never told me I needed anything. I had nothing to show from the Home Office. They should have got somebody to speak to the people at the airport, something to show them. I don’t know why they didn’t do that.“I had to go back home. I haven’t slept at all. I keep asking myself why have they done this to me. It’s giving me headaches because I’m thinking too much. I can’t even eat, I can’t drink, because I don’t know why this has happened.“I was in the airport, I was happy. I saw the flight. I knew I was going back. Now I feel so afraid.\u0026nbspI don’t even want to move from my bedroom. I don’t want to leave. I’m scared people will know who I am. I just want to get out of this mess. I’m tired of it.”PN, whose full name cannot be disclosed for legal reasons, arrived in the UK in 2011 and claimed asylum on the basis that she was a lesbian and would be at risk of persecution in Uganda. But this was refused and she was removed in 2013 because the Home Office did not believe she was gay.The Home Office has been ordered to facilitate her return to the UK, but is set to appeal the decision, meaning PN faces the prospect of being sent back to Uganda again if the department is successful.Karen Doyle, national organiser of Movement for Justice, a group which has been supporting PN financially since she was removed to Uganda, said: “Being turned away from the flight was frightening and devastating for PN. Having to make her way back to her room in the early hours of the morning after hours in the airport full of anticipation and hope she would be safe in the UK today.“Once again the home office have shown their lack of care and concern for her\u0026nbspsafety. This latest blow for PN is emblematic of the delays, appeals and blocks the Home Office have put in place ever since the order for her return on 24\u0026nbspJune.“It is not acceptable and the Home Office must do everything they can to put this right and get PN out of Uganda.”PN’s return (Phillip Raymond Goodman)It comes as\u0026nbspmore than 400 people staged a protest outside the Home Office building, calling on Priti Patel, the\u0026nbspnew home secretary, to\u0026nbspend the “hostile environment” and deportations.Lucille from the All African Women’s\u0026nbspGroup, a self-help group of women asylum seekers and immigrants, many of whom have been detained in Yarl’s Wood, said: “As women, we suffer particularly from the hostile environment because we are poorer to begin with, are often traumatised from rape and other violence and because we are often mothers with responsibility for other precious human beings.“We face a sexist, racist Home Office and companies that profit from deportation.\u0026nbspWe demand an end to the hostile environment, to detention, destitution and deportations and an end to the separation of families.”Asylum and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think that with Jeremy Corbyn he has got to look deep into himself and say is he up to the job, is he up to the challenge that (he) now faces because if not, we are heading to a very dark, dangerous place with an unbelievably right-wing, populist Government and the answer to which is not a populism of the left.Johnson to meet farmers in Wales as pound slumps amid no-deal fearsGovernment immigration plan will have \u0027devastating\u0027 impact, Khan warnsBoris Johnson admits EU leaders sticking to their position on BrexitBoris Johnson’s new Brexit chief wants to scrap workers’ rightsHe continued: I don\u0027t think it\u0027s personal, I think I\u0027m saying what I think, it\u0027s based on a lot of experience of campaigns and of politics, and reading it as I read it now, Labour is facing its own existential crisis... I think there is a danger that we\u0027re going to be destroyed as a serious credible political force unless we face up to the reality of what\u0027s going on.On Labour\u0027s Brexit policy, Mr Corbyn reiterated at the weekend his support for a referendum on any deal reached with the European Union, and said even if Labour is in government a public vote would be held.He refused, however, to say whether Labour would back Remain or its own negotiated deal if the party came to power.\u0026nbsp“We’ve got to get in office first to negotiate a deal,” he said. “We’ve got to win an election – if we win an election then we’re going to have talks with the European Union. But at the moment, the danger is a no-deal exit on 31 October with all the problems that brings.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

White\u0027s goal was England\u0027s second of the match, which they went on to win 2-1He also faced open calls to stand down, with the latest from\u0026nbspLord Mandelson, a long-time critic of Mr Corbyn, who told the party\u0026nbspto ditch him in favour of a leader who can “stand up to Boris Johnson”.But how could the party replace Mr Corbyn, if it wanted\u0026nbspto?Under Labour rules, a leadership contest is triggered if a challenger can secure the backing of 20 per cent of MPs and MEPs.There are currently 247 Labour MPs and 10 Labour MEPs, so a challenger would need 49 or 50 MPs to support them.A would-be leader would then have to notify Labour’s general secretary of the challenge.The incumbent leader does not need to secure nominations to be on the ballot paper, according to the latest Labour Party rulebook.Ballots are cast by members and supporters, with the result announced at annual\u0026nbspconference if the party is in opposition. The process can be sped up if Labour is in government.Another tactic would be either a no-confidence vote or\u0026nbspmass resignations from the Labour front bench, in order to ramp up the pressure on the Labour leader to quit.In reality, would-be challengers\u0026nbspwill be well aware\u0026nbspthat Mr Corbyn has survived all such\u0026nbspattempts during nearly four years at the helm.He endured a\u0026nbspstring of resignations in 2016 triggered by the sacking of Hilary Benn, who now chairs the Commons Brexit committee.Mr Corbyn lost a confidence vote the same year but he refused to stand down, as he said the ballot did not have “constitutional legitimacy” against an elected leader.The Labour leader then saw off a challenge from Owen Smith in 2016 and increased his mandate, cementing his position further.\u0026nbspMr Corbyn insists he is “not worried” about taking on Mr Johnson\u0026nbspand Labour is ready to fight\u0026nbspthe new Tory leader\u0026nbspat the polls.He will also\u0026nbspreassured by\u0026nbspa recent YouGov survey\u0026nbspthat found more than half of Labour members (56 per cent) said he should lead the party into the next election.But as\u0026nbspMr Johnson steers\u0026nbsphis party towards a no-deal Brexit, while the Liberal Democrats enjoy\u0026nbspa resurgence under\u0026nbspnew leader Jo Swinson,\u0026nbspMr Corbyn, the great survivor, may find the ground shifting.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Just standard food it seems.And last month, a cannibal seagull was seen feasting on another gulls corpse in Devon.Others have been spotted eating pigeons live in front of horried diners in Cornwall and greedily swallowing a chick whole off the Northumberland coast after snatching it from its mum.But its not just birds blood that gulls have acquired a taste for.Boozy seagulls have been spotted falling off rooftops, stumbling around and even vomiting on people after drinking the dregs of pint glasses across the UK.It turns out, like the rest of us, they cant cope with too much of the stuff .This month, a group of gulls were spotted making the most of half-empty wine and beer bottles left behind on a Bournemouth beach by louts along with a bottle of urine.But on other occasions, theyve viciously swiped booze out of revellers hands.Fiona Heath, from Glasgow, Scotland, was gutted when a gull pinched her wine, writing on Twitter: A seagull just came and drank my wine knocked over my wine glass.Sharing a crying emoji, she added: No more wine for me.The RSPCA, who treated nearly  sozzled birds in just two weeks last year, said the creatures initially appeared to have a disease - but then, after vomiting, most seem to recover.“The birds absolutely stink of alcohol when we collect them so now our vans smell like pubs, charity officer Jo Daniel said at the time of the initial drunken outbreak last summer.Footage, shared by the animal welfare organisation, shows a boozed-up gull tottering backwards, in scenes that will trigger déjà vu for anyone whos had one too many shots.Firefighter watch manager Virgil Turner went to rescue a drunken seagull in Dorset and was vomited on.He told Devon Live: “When we arrived he [the gull] had already fallen off the roof, he was sitting shaking his head and he then tried to fly and he nearly hit me in the face.I caught him and he threw up all over me and he reeked of beer.It is suspected the gulls had consumed brewing waste.And in recent weeks, many gulls have been tanked up for another reason - the huge swarms of insects invading UK cities as part of the Flying Ant Day phenomenon.The ants - who venture out of their nests at this time of year to hunt for a mate - contain formic acid, which stupefies seagulls and causes them to act like theyre on LSD.Gulls have been seen going crazy in the skies, swooping on to dual carriageways, and reportedly acting more violently. Some have even been hit and killed by unsuspecting drivers.The increasingly aggressive nature of British seagulls has come under the spotlight recently - with reports of dead dogs, pensioners pecked on the head and a postman left shaken by repeated attacks.Adult seagulls also become incredibly protective at this time of year as their chicks get ready to flee the nest.Its thought that the phenomenon is provoked by wet weather followed by hot, humid conditions - but boffins have suggested it might not be as predictable as first thought.Flying Ant Day occurs when the ants sprout their wings and head off on whats known as a nuptial flight.During this time, the insects look around to find a mate, before landing to start a new colony.Queen ants emerge from the nest to begin their nuptial flight with the male ants usually flying alongside.The most common type of wflying ant is the black garden iety . Hose nests have a single queen and anything from , to , workers.Councils as far inland as Worcestershire have even hired gull control officers to help keep the birds at bay, while some have called for a cull of the vicious flying rats.Conservative councillor Alan Amos told Sun Online last week that we need a nationwide gull cull to tackle the problem. The Isle of Wight rescue organisation Wild Bird Aid posted images of six dead gulls on Facebook, saying it witnessed a driver purposefully drive over one of them.The RSPB says that, by law, you cant kill or try to control gulls without a licence. People who do so can face up to six months in prison or a £, fine.Recently, drivers were seen deliberately aiming for gulls - which are a protected species - as the boozed-up birds flew around dual carriageways.This time they werent high on alcohol, but flying ants. It is thought the ants formic acid reacts in the gulls stomach, making them appear drunk and more aggressive.It comes as the hunt for chihuahua Gizmo, snatched from his owners garden in Paignton, continues - with The Sun offering a £, reward for anyone who finds the pup.Devastated owner Rebecca Hill said: I’m really grateful to The Sun and its readers for trying to find Gizmo. I can’t explain how painful it is to lose my ‘baby’ in such an awful way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So much for the “backstop” being vital to avoid a hard border. In the end they’ll just make checks away from the border, as Eurosceptics said.Our new Cabinet, meanwhile, fizzes with energy and resolve. Long may it last.And while a suicide squad of Tory Remoaners may still fancy forcing an election to avoid No Deal, that threat looks far less potent than a week ago.WE despair of our police.Yes, they are short-staffed.

And the Met commissions a spray-painter to daub a nick with cartoons bearing banal messages.Some forces have given up on burglaries, blaming cuts. The Met often seems to have given up on even more serious crime. Yet the stunts and virtue-signalling keep coming. And police chiefs seem too dim to grasp how bad it looks.New policing minister Kit Malthouse is focused on recruitment. But he must also lay down the law about ato basic crime-fighting and detection.Plus a ban on social media posts that do nothing for the public but enrage it.IT began with Jews. Now Labour’s race hatred extends to black and ethnic minority people who vote the “wrong” way.Look how they are targeting BAME Cabinet members. Clive Lewis MP, an acolyte of anti-Semite Corbyn, tells black Tory chairman James Cleverly he “sold his soul” to serve “a racist PM”.A Corbynite “journalist” says politicians like Sajid Javid and Priti Patel are “no longer a person of colour. They are a turncoat of colour”.Labour has no time for BAME people it cannot deploy as victims of Tory “oppression”. If they reject that victimhood, vote Conservative or, worse, have the talent to reach the top of a Tory Government, they are not “properly” BAME.Such is the poison of “identity politics” spread by Corbyn and his cult of hate-filled halfwits.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not the civil service nor the BBC. Not the House of Lords. Not Tony Blair and John Major and Gordon Brown. Not the Labour Party.And not the combined might of Bob Geldof, Gary Lineker and the bloke who screams, “STOP BREXIT!” in Parliament Square from dawn till dusk.Oh how they all loathed Brexit and everyone who voted for it! They truly believed that those of us who voted to leave the European Union were all thick, racist bigots.There was never any real attempt to change the minds of the .million. There were only sneers, jeers and smears — and the full might of the British establishment committed to stop Brexit from ever happening.Brexit — a true Brexit — has not always seemed inevitable. There have been times over the past few years when the EU looked like the Hotel Calornia, where you can check out but you can never leave.But in the end, it did not matter what they wanted — the elite, the ones with power, the pampered factions of the British establishment, who are totally accustomed to getting their way.Because once the British people had made their democratic decision, Brexit was ALWAYS going to happen in the end.It is more than three years since the nation decided to leave the European Union.But it is only a matter of days that we have had a Prime Minister who actually believes in Brexit.Boris has electried Britain with his vision of a bright, shining future for our country outside of the  rotting EU empire.My heart says Prime Minister Johnson will get Brexit done. So do the bookies.He will probably need a General Election before Christmas to shake up the Parliamentary numbers, but Boris will make it happen.ButBoris can’t do it, then somebody  will make Brexit happen.Brexit is bigger than Boris. Democracy is more important than any one politician.And let the record state: It would have worked the other way around.If the British people had decided in the summer of  that we were staying in the European Union, then no amount of bitching from Brussels-loathing old gits such as myself would have mattered a damn.We would have stayed in the EU for a generation. Our current national debate is not ultimately about leaving or remaining.It is about democracy. And democracy still matters here.Democracy is deep in the British DNA, far deeper than in all those European nations where they have the national memory of a jackboot resting on their throats, far deeper than in all those countries where they have been invaded, occupied and tormented by tyrants.That is why the British establishment, in the end, could not veto Brexit. Sorry, chaps, you can’t dial down democracy. You can’t cancel the will of the people. Not in THIS country.The people decidedIn the end, democracy would not be denied. They could not reverse, overrule or cancel a referendum result in a country that has not been invaded for one thousand years.The will of the establishment — all those ex-Prime Ministers, all those well-heeled big shots, all those Right Honourable members and ermine-clad Lords, all those BBC executives, all those crisp sellers and ex-members of the Boomtown Rats — did not matter more than the will of the people.There is a historical inevitability about this country leaving the EU because, quite simply, it is what the people decided.And no matter what the establishment may believe, the people in this country are not their servants.Our great country is a democracy.Now and for ever, the people are the masters.And that makes Brexit unstoppable.NEW Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson wants a second referendum  but admits she would still campaign to keep the UK in the EU evenwe voted to leave yet again.Oh Jo. You may be a liberal. But you are not much of a democrat.Now the cops have dragged Fadi out, kicking and screaming.The property has been secured but worried neighbours say that Fadi could easily get back in with  a ladder.Oh Fadi, you don’t need a ladder. You need a job.And to stop poncing off the generosity of George Michael.THE Conservative Party is now the true representative of the working class.Lefty loons sneer that the Tories are as riven by racism as Labour, that the anti- Semitism that is rotting Labour is matched by Islamophobia in the Conservative Party.But a political party that disliked Muslims would not appoint the son of a Pakistani bus driver to one of the great offices of state – Sajid Javid as Chancellor of the Exchequer.And a party that was inherently racist would not promote Priti Patel – the daughter of Hindu refugees – to Home Secretary.And what a joy to see Esther McVey – who spent part of her young le in a Barnardo’s care home –to the Cabinet as Housing Minister.We may have an Old Etonian as PM, but the Tories are the party of the people now.I AM starting to look forward to an autumn general election.The most devastating put-down that our new Prime Minister made in the House of Commons was the one aimed at John McDonnell.“The Shadow Chancellor!” said Boris, jabbing a finger at McDonnell’s florid, furious face. “Sacked by Ken Livingstone for being too left-wing . . .  sacked for fabricating a budget!”Like every bully who ever lived, McDonnell can dish it out but he sure can’t take it.Jeremy Corbyn suddenly looks more like a candidate for a care home than  Downing Street. But McDonnell could prove to be an even bigger electoral liability to Labour.If that autumn general election comes, the voters must look at McDonnell and ask themselves: Should I really trust a miserable old Marxist with my wallet Perhaps we should send that aid to countries that are not sending rockets to the Moon.Or better still, help the needy in our own country.THE new series of Strictly will be graced by another of the remarkable Mabuse sisters – Motsi Mabuse, Oti’s big sister, who is replacing Darcey Bussell when the th series starts in September.There have been fears expressed that the new judge might favour her kid sister.I can’t think of anything less likely.The three Mabuse sisters – Oti, Motsi and middle sister Phemelo – all danced their way out of riot-torn, apartheid-riven South Africa.They are all dancing pros to the core of their being.Bet your last sequin that Motsi will not do Oti any favours.HOW sad to hear that  Rutger Hauer has died at the age of . Rutger gave one of cinema’s greatest  performances as the android Roy in  Ridley Scott’s  masterpiece, Blade Runner.

He then took his own le eight years later.Given that one in  of the population identies as gay, this doesn’t exactly seem representative.And that’s probably why @FootballerGay’s account racked up so much support so quickly.The account’s profile said the player was a “proud gay man”. He posted numerous tweets saying his club had been informed of his decision to come out and had been supportive. He tweeted saying that on July  he would reveal his identity.But instead, the account was deleted a couple of days ago. And shortly before that, the bio on the account was changed to read: “I thought I was strong enough. I’m not.”Although his tweets had messages of support from people such as Gary Lineker, lots of other people doubted the authenticity of the account.That includes my husband, an ex professional footballer.His view is that these days no one, from other players to the club, would caresomeone were gay.He should know. He played with Justin Fashanu and says no one in the dressing room had a problem with Justin being gay and he wasn’t treated any dferently to anyone .Still, outside the dressing room, he was singled out.Just one example is the time the owner of the opposing team called him a faggot from the sidelines.Fashanusprinted towards this guy, who got so scared he locked himself in the Press box.Fashanu kicked the door down to find the guy pleading, crying and denying he said anything. Justin could look after himself. But that kind of thing took its toll.Although we’ve moved on since , hearing stories such as that does make you realise why some footballers might think twice about coming out.I don’t carethe Twitter account was real or not. After all, who someone sleeps with is none of my business. Butsomeone wants to come out to the world, it is a terrible state of affairshe thinks he needs to be strong and “brave” to do so.And the reality is that attitudes towards a lot of things have changed over the past couple of decades.I remember when I turned up at the Director’s Box of an away game when I first took over at Birmingham City Football Club in .When I asked where the boardroom was I was told that director’s wives go in the ladies room. When I mentioned that I was the managing director the old boy on the desk put his glasses on, looked at me and said: “Oh yes, you’re that woman . . . stay here and I will find out what to do with you.”Because, at that point, women where banned from entering the boardrooms.That was the first door I ever kicked down. So I know in a very small way how being the first and being dferent to everyone  in football feels.Nowadays I am proud to say there are so many talented women running clubs. And I like to think we have moved on enough that no one would bat an eyelid at a gay footballer.Still, the football world can be a fairly intolerant place for anyone who is anything close to a minority.Maybe it’s the case that until we create a tolerant, accepting environment and culture then footballers won’t feel safe enough to come out.But which will comes first: that . . . or, someone like this being brave enough to admit they are gay and face the possible backlash.Only time will tell.And what I’d really like to see is a football culture in which someone’s sexual orientation really is neither here nor there.DID anyone  wince looking at the photo of the man intercepting his girlfriend’s moment of glory when she was being awarded her degree – to drop down on one knee and propose I guess Edgaras Averbuchas saw it as a romantic gesture but to the onlooker it was just a bit, well, selfish.For a start it looked like he couldn’t bear to let Agne Banuskeviciute have her moment in the sun so muscled in.

I mean, whatAgne wanted to say no Why didn’t he just let her graduate and then ask her in the evening to marry him But also, Agne wasn’t the only person graduating that day – I wonder how everyone  felt about having their big day overshadowed by this big “romantic” gesture Sorry to say that this does not bode well for the relationship.And my advice to this young woman would be to run while you still have the chance and find someone content to allow you to be successful in your own right.[boxout featured-image introI LOVED reading about Mackenzie O’Neill, the -year-old from Canterbury, Kent, who found himself having a bit of a kickabout with Lionel Messi on a Caribbean beach – the stuff that dreams are made of for some kids.]This is the kind of memory that never goes away, but it’s not only children that live for a moment like this. My husband, himself a professional footballer, played on the beach with Diego Maradona about five years agoand he still can’t stop talking about it.[ boxout]KEVIN CASH, once hailed as one of Britain’s most successful property tycoons with a fortune of £million, was declared bankrupt last July with debts of £million.So it is no surprise that he and fourth we Carla are now going to have to make a few changes to their lives.But when you hear that they used to spend £,-a-month on groceries and “housekeeping”, it becomes clear how hard it might be for them to get used to bankruptcy and shopping, presumably, at Lidl.What on earth are they buying  Gold bars to eat Now they’ll be shopping in the bargain bin.As Arsene Wenger used to say about Arsenal’s performances: “One day caviar, and the next cabbage.”WHATEVER you think about Theresa May, no one could deny that she is driven by a sense of duty to the country.So it’s no surprise that she has shed a tear once or twice over the past couple of very dficult months of dashed hopes and disappointments.But what has struck me when she’s been caught crying on camera is how quick people seem to be to triumph over what they see as a sign of weakness.Meanwhile,a man in a position of responsibility is seen to show emotion or shed a tear, he is seen as admirable, noble and passionate.I mean, it’s one thing wearing one in bed, it’s another thing altogether wearing it in bed with a new girlfriend.But to do so on national TV Well, all I can say is, I hope he wasn’t in his socks as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

violence in intimate relationships and violence against women and girls.Im sure the author of this post is aware of the links between the night time economy and serious violence, particularly domestic

is positive, he told The Sun Online.Yes we get criticised by the PC brigade but you cant say anything these days without upsetting someone.The Georges Facebook page frequently mocks healthy eating and even offers free food to morbidly obese customers.We are the most caloric pub in the UK and we stand by our fantastic food and menu as well as the marketing campaigns, Mr Harker said.This isnt Weight

our Facebook page maybe the ones complaining should go outside, smell the roses, spend time with loved ones and just live a little.The upset comes just two years after the same pub was rapped for a similar ad asking: Would you punch your ex in the face for a parmo The Advertising Standards Authority ruled the words referred to domestic violence and was likely to cause serious offence.The George is due to reopen on Wednesday after a fire destroyed much of the building and has promised to provide its most unhealthy menu yet when it does.Domestic violence campaigner David Challen, whose mum

gulf open letter pm","story":"In the letter, published on his personal website, President Hassan Rouhani congratulated Johnson on becoming prime minister and said he hoped for renewed bilateral relations between their countries.Tensions between Iran and Britain have escalated since the British seizure of an Iranian oil tanker, Grace , off Gibraltar earlier this month.The vessel had been suspected of attempting to take oil to Syria, in breach of a European embargo.Iran responded by seizing a British-flagged oil tanker, the Stena Impero, as it made its way through the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf last Friday.Both vessels continue to be detained.The row has seen Iran accuse the UK of committing evil deeds and state piracy, with then-foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt responding that Iran had broken the law and that British shipping must and will be protected.President Rouhanis full letter read: I would like to offer my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.I hope that Your Excellency’s familiarity with relations between Iran and the United Kingdom, and your only one visit to Tehran greatly contribute to removing the existing obstacles on the path of development of relations between the two countries, and we witness further deepening of bilateral and multilateral relations during your tenure as the Prime Minister.I wish Your Excellency health and success.The words your only one visit to Tehran were in reference to a trip the new prime minister made to the Iranian capital in  while serving as foreign secretary.After entering Downing Street last week, Johnson ordered that all British ships passing through the Gulf be provided with a Royal Navy escort.Britain currently has one warship, HMS Montrose, in the Gulf, soon to be joined and then replaced by the larger HMS Duncan.Iran has previously proposed that the detained vessels could be swapped, but the offer was this morning rejected by Dominic Raab, who was appointed foreign secretary after Johnson entered Downing Street on Wednesday.Speaking to BBC Radio, Raab said: There is no quid pro quo.Grace  was intercepted because it was in breach of sanctions and heading with oil to Syria.The Stena Impero was unlawfully detained. So this isn’t about some kind of barter.This is about the international law and the rules of the international legal system being upheld and that is what we will insist on.He later told Sky News: If the Iranians want to come of the dark and be accepted as a responsible member of the intentional community they need to adhere to rules-based system of the international community."},{"url":null,"title":"beautiful landscapes britain photos","story":"Alessio Putzu, , snapped the amazing shots during his trips to Devon and Cornwall in England, Pembrokeshire, North Wales and Isle of Skye, Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"mystery australian town graffiti chris baby","story":"Walls, buildings and public barbeques all over the Melbourne suburb of Frankston have been covered with the bright purple messaging.Photos of the mystery messages were posted on the Frankston community noticeboard Facebook page, with the plea: “Chris ...

And then it happens: Bruce sees me and slowly walks towards me.He leans in and says: “Your book is really beautul.”It was the most incredible rush of euphoria coursing through me. It was beyond amazing to be complimented for my work by someone whose music had meant so much to me for so long.That was eight years ago and now the book has been turned into a movie called Blinded By The Light, which comes out in cinemas next week.The first time I had heard Bruce Springsteen was in .

Amolak did not laugh.He told me I was an idiot and that Bruce Springsteen was the direct line to all that was true in this world.I was bemused by his passion and so when he handed me a couple of cassettes with Springsteen songs, I promised I would give them a listen.What I heard literally changed my le. In The River, Bruce sings: “I come from down in the valley, where mister when you’re young, they bring you up to do like your daddy done.”This was not like anything I had ever heard. I was a Top  music lover but this sounded less like a song than a short story put to music.I listened to other songs —  like Thunder Road, where he sings: “It’s a town full of losers and I’m ­pulling out of here to win.”My first thought on hearing that line was to wonder whether Born To Run singer Bruce had spent some time in Luton.Springsteen’s music was grounded in reality. His songs were about guys who worked in factories, lived in dead-end towns and wanted a better le.I think the reason he spoke so powerfully to me is that being an Asian teenager in Luton in the Eighties meant that so many of the themes of Springsteen’s songs connected directly to my le.My dad had come to Britain from Pakistan in the early Sixties and my mother and the rest of the family joined him in the spring of .Dad worked on the production line at the Vauxhall car factory and Mum worked as a seamstress at home.Money was very tight so there were no birthday presents or holidays and most of the clothes I wore came from jumble sales.Racism was re. Some of it was explicit, such as the boy who would spit in the face of Asian kids.Sometimes it was more subtle, such as the fact all my friends had Saturday jobs but whenever I tried to apply for one the position would mysteriously not be available.My dad believed that the best way to rise above our circumstances was through ­education. Anything that distracted from studies — friends, music, going to the cinema — was frowned upon.He wanted me to get a respectable job. He would have been delightedI had shown some interest in being a doctor.But I was always dferent.I wanted a le less ordinary and a job that was not just about ­dutul drudgery.That is the basis for Blinded By The Light, which is a semi- fictionalised retelling of my ­childhood. The film is the story of Javedwho is  and longs to become a writer.But this is an impossible dream until a friend introduces him to the music of Bruce Springsteen.That music sparks a fire inside Javed, prompting him to stand up to his dad, find a girlfriend and follow his dream to be a writer.The film is sometimes fictionalised — I didn’t really have a girlfriend back then — but the basic plot is true and I really did end up leaving Luton for Manchester and then became a writer.In  I published my memoir. I toyed with the idea of sending the book to Bruce, but never did — so I had no idea whether he knew the book existed.That was why it was such a delightful shock to learn when I met him at the British Film ­Institute in London in  that not only did he know the book existed, he had read and enjoyed it. When he told me that, I had something close to an ­emotional breakdown.Meanwhile, Gurinder Chadha — the film director I was attending the BFI with — leapt in and told Bruce she was going to direct a film version of the book.Bruce nodded and said ­something along the lines of: “Sounds good.”I poured as much love and heart and authenticity as I could into writing the script, digging into my teenage diaries and poems.Finally it was ready to send to Bruce. This was a nail-biting moment. If Bruce didn’t like it, there was no film, since we needed his consent to use his music. One evening in spring  I got a call from Gurinder saying I had to write a letter to Bruce asking for his music.I sat down and wrote the most important letter I had ever written.It was nerve-racking because I could feel this was one of those fork-in-the-road moments. One road led to getting this film made and the other led to  . . .  who knew Two weeks later, when I was at the Hay Literary Festival, I got a call. Gurinder was ringing to say Bruce had said he was fine with it. We had his approval!In January Gurinder, Viveik Kalra — who plays Javed — and I travelled to Utah for the Sundance Film Festival where Blinded By The Light had its world premiere.It received a rapturous reception and was bought by Warner ­Brothers New Line for a festival record-breaking £million.In the months since, I have ­travelled across the US and Britain attending preview screenings of the film ahead of its general release next Friday.What I have found so extraordinary is the way that so many ­people have taken the film to their hearts. I have lost count of the number of times people have told me the film has left them laughing and crying.In Los Angeles I met a white woman who grew up in a Baptist community in Tennessee with a dream to be a singer which her father did not support. “Your story is my story,” she told me.I met a white man in San ­Francisco who was in his early twenties. He said he has never connected to a film the way he did to this one.My story was connecting with people who had never heard of Luton and had probably never spent any time with Pakistanis — and that felt incredibly humbling.When I was in Luton I felt a connection to America through Bruce’s music.Now, through this film, I hope it can make a connection between those who see it and the world from which I come.The thing I had loved about Bruce’s music was that it felt so specic but it was also universal.I wanted to do that too — to do for Bury Park, Luton, what he did for Asbury Park, New Jersey.The journey from my memoirs, Greetings From Bury Park, to Blinded By The Light has taken  years but there could arguably be no better time for this film to be released than now.We live in deeply ided times and we have leaders who want to exploit these isions.Blinded By The Light is a joyous and timely reminder of the things we have in common and a blast of hope and light in what can seem dark and hopeless times. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see on it people I once admired behave in a way that erases nearly all respect.Intelligent iniduals make comments they would regretthey had been texts to friends, let alone messages to the whole world.People who once seemed judicious in their judgements behave — at best — like scolds, desperately attempting to ­correct the world for not ­holding precisely the same views as themselves.Yet Twitter has the ability to ­highlight at speed problems only ­noticeable at a slower RPM in the real world.One is the uncomfortable, ever-vanishing line between comment and journalism.While this blurring is not completely new, there was a fine example last week.As news of Boris Johnson’s successful Conservative Party election victory broke, Lewis Goodall — Sky’s political correspondent — tweeted a photo of a television autocue with the caption: “So great to share a set with Black Mirror today.”For those unfamiliar with it, Black Mirror is a Netflix series created by the formerjournalist Charlie Brooker featuring ious dystopian fantasy futures.There is not very much for Goodall or anyone  to gain from this observation.It is possible some people saw it and gave a snort of appreciation.Perhaps somebody somewhere actually laughed. But it is unlikely anyone is still roaring, days later, at the brilliance and perceptiveness of the observation.Like most things on social media, the short-term gain is not worth the cost. For a cost there is, paid in public trust evennot by the tweeter.If broadcasters still cared about the editorial independence of their employees, comments like this would not be made by their journalists.For they further reveal what most of the public has come to suspect — that broadcasters presenting themselves as non-partisan in fact hold very clear political views and that these usually veer in a particular direction.Most, for instance, tend not to be enthusiastic Leave voters who secretly admire Prime Minister Boris Johnson and occasionally let this truth slip. Of course, people have always harboured their suspicions.But not until journalists began to freely give away their thoughts on social media was there such a smorgasbord of evidence.For years, Gavin Esler was the apparently impartial presenter of many leading BBC political shows, including Newsnight, holding people to account whatever his own views.This was back when we viewers did not have access to a presenter’s opinions.Instead, we would have to guess from throwaway remarks or how one interview compared with another.After the Brexit vote, however, it became clear that Esler had strong views about British membership of the EU.Then, this April, he announced his membership and candidacy for the pro-Remain party Change UK.In a speech at its launch and in subsequent media appearances, he turned out to be as partial as it was possible to be.Indeed, some of his political interventions could legitimately be described as “foam-flecked”.Are the public to pretend Gavin Esler pre- was a dferent beast from the Gavin Esler of this year Or do we presume he always held certain views and only broke out when there was a chance to express them while standing — as it turned out, unsuccessfully — as a candidate for the European Parliament By following broadcasters on Twitter, particularly from the BBC and Sky, it is clear to see the barrier is eroding for everyone.When Goodall sent his Black Mirror tweet, the journalist Tim Montgomerie tweeted: “Throughout Sky News we have pundits posing as reporters. Neither Sky execs nor Ofcom seem to give a damn.”In response, Goodall’s Sky News colleague Kay Burley went for Montgomerie herself, tweeting: “You’re an absolute disgrace to our profession. Seriously.”It was, as Montgomerie went on to say, a pretty unprofessional response in itself.But he was right. There is something strange about this whole game.Partly it is so eroding to public trust because it all goes in one direction.On one single occasion in recent years has a television presenter let slip a view that did not fall into lockstep with the narrow orthodoxies of the broadcasting class.When ­Politics Live presenter Andrew Neil sent out one tweet last year mocking the increasingly conspiratorial Observer writer Carole Cadwalladr, he deleted the tweet and himself became a news story.There were swt calls for his sacking and the BBC felt compelled to publicly chastise Neil.Though widely considered the country’s leading ­political interviewer, Neil no longer has a regular slot on the BBC.The incident stands out partly because it is so unusual for a broadcaster not to go in one predictable direction, but also because it was clear that a price must only be paid when the opinions are the “wrong” ones.The breaking of the “fourth wall” — which meant impartial broadcasters refrained from veering into personal political expression — has had a damaging effect on broadcast journalism.Just observing what a broadcaster like Emily Maitlis chooses to retweet tells me more than I want to know about her own political views.These retweets go in the usual direction, and it bothers me not a jot where those views dfer from my own.The trouble is they begin to colour the rest of the work.When Rod Liddle appeared on Newsnight and was roundly harangued and insulted by Maitlis, I did not think: “What a tough interview.”Having seen what Maitlis had tweeted and retweeted in recent months, I simply saw the same views played out in the Newsnight studio.There was no mystery, no separation between impartial interviewer and opinionated tweeter.Will this have an impact  My guess is it already has.And when the broadcast media complains about disappearing trust in their profession, remember — they have only themselves to blame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I put this up to try and be helpful, never did I expect it to blow up and me being judged as lazy parent.I filled the basket with everything I bought as an example for the photo, they will not be getting this much each day - however, yes some days they may so shoot me.Also as stated below there is fruit that they are more than welcome to have and have no cap on hence why it’s not in the basket.Speaking to the MEN, the -year-old, from Wales, said: It’s so crazy how much this post has blown up.People shouldnt be so cruel and judgemental to people behind a screen, their words can be so damaging.Theyre lucky I’m a strong person and can take the bad comments but the good far outweigh, lighten up enjoy the tip or just scroll on by.Despite the criticism - with some people even slating her sons names - Shannon had hundreds of comments from people praising her idea and saying they would be copying it in their own homes.I saw the idea on Instagram and thought wow that’s great, she said.So we went shopping, the boys picked a few snacks they liked and then when we got home I filled the baskets with one of everything just for an example, they wouldn’t have all of that.I cook homemade meals almost every day, they have unlimited fruit always available and the two are very active so why not let them have treats."},{"url":null,"title":"luisa zissman opens up bladder","story":"NewsLuisa Zissman opens up about bladder weakness after embarrassing incidentEx-Apprentice star and mum of three says we need to be less British about bladder problemsShareCommentsByAmy Packer:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsLuisa Zissman first experienced urinary incontinence when she was pregnant with her third child, Clementine\"Get the biggest daily Celebrity Big Brother stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFor Luisa Zissman, it was one of the most embarrassing moments of her le. And she’s appeared on The Apprentice. While performing a fitness test to qualy for a charity horse race, she lost control of her bladder. “I was doing my ‘bleep test’ where you run back and forth between two beeps which get faster and faster and honestly I had no control,” admits the -year-old from Herts. “I wet myself to the point you could see it. It was a full-on wet patch front and back, in front of  people – including a television film crew with the cameras rolling.    “That was one of the most ­embarrassing things that has ever happened to me, but I’m competitive so I didn’t want to stop running because I didn’t want to fail. All I could say was ‘I’ve had three kids!’. “I just had to try to front it out and said, ‘Guys, we’ve all seen Paula Radclfe do it on TV’. I had worn two pairs of pants and a pad and it still came through.” Luisa first experienced urinary incontinence when she was ­pregnant with her third child, ­Clementine, who is now  months. “I had morning sickness and when I puked I would pee myself. At the time I thought it was the weight of the baby, but about three months after she was born I got a sickness bug and it happened again. “I think having a third baby tipped me over the edge. After Dixie, who is nine, I was fine but I got pregnant with Clementine when my second baby, Indigo, was only five months and she was the trickiest birth. She got stuck and the consultant had to manipulate her to get her out. “I don’t knowmy problem is caused by trauma or just having two consecutive babies very quickly, but now whether I’m sneezing, laughing or running I pee myself. The only forms of exercise I can do without wetting myself are Pilates and horse riding.”   It’s a relief for the Celebrity Big Brother star that she hasn’t had to give up her horse due to the problem – she’s been riding since she was four and this August is taking part in the Magnolia Cup, a charity horse race at Goodwood, to raise funds for Wellbeing of Women.“I’m proud to be racing for an amazing charity,” she says. “They do loads of research into urinary incontinence and chatting about my issue has been really interesting. From what I heard when I visited their offices, Botox might even be able to help me.” Luisa is certainly not alone. Incontinence is a signicant issue for ­approximately three million women in the UK. Six weeks after pregnancy, % of women report urinary ­incontinence and one in three will suffer from it at some point. “I’m quite open about my problem now and just say, ‘Oh my God, I’m peeing’I have an accident around friends. I feel like loads of women actually suffer but don’t talk about it. “Once, while making my podcast, Loose Lips, I laughed so much that my co-host Anna Williamson thought I’d lost control of my bowels as well. But I had peed so much it had made my fake tan run, which had stained my clothes. I had to go and change.” Luisa has used several gadgets to try and solve the problem, “I used this manual Kegel exerciser and one which was a bit like a ­Slendertone. You insert it and it ­electrocutes the muscles but that put me right off so I only used it a couple of times,” she says. And now she is only just starting to have medical investigations to get to the bottom of her issues.

Mr Campbell hit out in BBC interviews and a y screed in the New European, where he is an editor-at-large. I no longer wish to stay in the party, evenI should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge, he said. I hope that one day I will rejoin a party that genuinely appeals to the many not the few.It comes after Mr Campbell was expelled from the Labour Party for five years for saying he voted Lib Dem in Mayaposs European elections.   His automatic exclusion - which he previously vowed to fight - prompted a backlash from ideological allies in Labour. And it triggered admissions by a string of grandees that they voted Lib Dem too. Itaposs understood Cherie Blair - the we of former PM Tony - was among those who failed to back Labour in Mayaposs EU elections.At the time Jeremy Corbyn suggested Mr Campbell should pledge loyalty to regain his membership, saying: I look forward to his support for Labour in the future.But in an all-out attack today Mr Campbell addressed his criticisms directly to the Labour leader. He wrote: Your half-hearted approach to the referendum campaign three years ago had a role in Leave winning. Your failure to provide consistent leadership on the issue since then has been a huge disappointment.  Your failure to challenge the lies, crimes and misdemeanours of the Leave campaign your pursuit of Labour versions of unicorns, such as a aposjobs first Brexit,apos your failure to master the detail sufficient to provide confidence to the public, or indeed to Europe, that you would be able to negotiate a better deal your refusal, despite having become leader in large part by promising to listen to members, to do so on Brexit your failure to mount the democratic case for the public having the right to say, given all we now know, whether they wish to proceed - these have all played into the hands of our opponents. Jeremy Corbyn has announced Labour will support a second referendum on any Brexit deal after months of internal wrangling. However, Labour could still go into the next general election vowing to get a Brexit deal with the EU, which would then be put to a public vote.  Mr Campbell told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: I think that with Jeremy Corbyn he has got to look deep into himself and say is he up to the job, is he up to the challenge thatnow faces. Becausenot, we are heading to a very dark, dangerous place with an unbelievably right-wing, populist Government and the answer to which is not a populism of the left.Mr Campbell said new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is trying to clear the decks towards a general election by heaping blame for Brexit failure on Parliament and the civil service."},{"url":null,"title":"government equalities office least fair","story":"NewsGovernment Equalities Office is least fair and inclusive workplace in WhitehallEXCLUSIVE: Government Equalities Office staff report unfair treatment and a third do not feel valuedShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political Editor:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsNew Welfare Secretary Amber Rudd heads up the department, which faces staff accusations of harassment and discrimination \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Government’s own Equalities Office has been found by its staff to be the least fair and inclusive workplace across Whitehall.   More than a quarter - % - did not feel that their bosses respected their inidual dferences, according to official data.

Speaking ahead of Tuesdayaposs visit, Mr Johnson outlined his vision for the farming sector selling ever more, not just here but around the world. Mr Johnson said: I will always back Britainaposs great farmers and as we leave the EU we need to make sure that Brexit works for them. That means scrapping the common agricultural policy and signing new trade deals - our amazing food and farming sector will be ready and waiting to continue selling ever more, not just here but around the world. Once we leave the EU on October , we will have a historic opportunity to introduce new schemes to support farming - and we will make sure that farmers get a better deal.

As part of a special report Zoey Stansfield spoke about how the area is still struggling to adjust to the six-in-one benefit. She said: “It’s not just about people ‘on benefits’,” “Universal Creditincludes working tax credit. Which means they’re working. We have had nurses coming in. There’s not often an acknowledgement that you could be working and claiming UC.” Due to demand, the food bank expanded into the former Three Crowns pub a couple of years ago. Instead of gin and vodka there are now thank-you cards pinned behind the bar. Diana said: “One lady came in here today, her brother-in-law had died and his we couldn’t cope.    “She’d taken six children into her home but she couldn’t get any benefits for them at all. With her own, that’s eight children in a two bed house. “She hadn’t got bedding or anything for them.

But we are not government funded.” Diana, notes the ‘sheer embarrassment’ she felt when a film crew from Brazil visited to interview them about poverty earlier this year, ‘because they felt sorry for us’. Debbie Abrahams, MP for Oldham and Saddleworth East, says ‘not a week a goes by’ without her office seeing at least one distressing case related to the benefit.    In recent weeks she has raised in Parliament the case of Sally, a single mum who escaped an abusive relationship, only to have her UC docked by £ due to her circumstances changing.

Tragically, this kind of treatment is far from unusual. An investigation by animal welfare charities found at least three quarters of zoos and aquariums force their beasts to interact with visitors. They also found lions and tigers forced to perform in shows in ‘gladiatorial’ ampitheatres to entertain large crowds and dolphins used as surfboards by their keepers. Elephants were poked with sticks to force them to play basketball, perform tricks, and give visitors rides. Chimpanzees and orangutans were made to wear nappies and human clothes, ride scooters, and kiss tourists as they posed for photographs.    The charities are now urging tourists to boycott zoos and aquariums that use cruel training methods to force their animals to interact with humans in this way, often causing lasting harm.Audrey Mealia, from World Animal Protection , said: “Seeing wild animals being used purely as circus acts and photos props was more like a horror show.“These ridiculous activities should be a thing of the past.”The new report, The Show Can’t Go On, has been published by World Animal Protection and the Change For Animals Foundation .The charities visited  animal parks across five continents, including attractions in America, Canada, France, Portugal, and Japan. They also examined how animals were used and treated at , zoos around the globe that are affiliated to the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums .    They found % offered visitors the chance to pet the animals, % allowed tourists to walk or swim through the animals’ enclosures, while % used their animals in live shows. Meanwhile, % allowed visitors to hand-feed the animals, while % allowed tourists to ride the animals. This fails to meet WAZA guidelines, which state that modern zoos and aquariums should not participate in animal shows or interactive experiences where animals perform unnatural behaviours. Dr Neil D’Cruze, global wildle advisor at World Animal Protection, said: “Seeing wild animals perform in circus-like shows or pose for photographs is not just a bit of fun. “What might be seen as an enjoyable activity on a day out for the family actually means a letime of suffering for these animals. Cruel and demeaning visitor attractions have no place in any modern zoo or aquarium.” The report did not identy major issues at any UK zoos or aquariums that are members of WAZA.    However, the charities warned that many British tourists would choose to visit parks in other countries which were affiliated with WAZA, either directly or indirectly through national associations, because they wrongly believed that guaranteed the animals were humanely treated. The report advises people not to visit any park that allows visitors to ride, touch, or bathe a wild animals, uses animals as props for photographs or as performers in circus-style shows, or makes animals dress or behave in an unnatural way. Training wild animals to interact with people and perform in shows often involves poking them with sticks, starving them to use food as a reward, or withdrawing social interaction for species like dolphins and elephants which normally live in family groups.    Conditions in zoos that are not affiliated to WAZA can be even worse and the parks may be linked to the illegal wildle trade, the charities warned. Harry Eckman, Director, Change for Animals Foundation, said: “All of these ridiculous activities represent a clear and present danger to the wild animals involved. “Circus-like shows and elephant rides typically involve harsh training methods to establish dominance and the use of wild animals as photo props can inflict stress and injuries. “UK tourists can make a stand by not visiting or supporting these venues. This will send out a clear message – that treating animals in this way is not acceptable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"castaways sought live chilean island","story":"NewsCastaways sought to live on island off Chile by Brit who owns it for £k-a-monthLady Kristyna Drummond-Hay, from Wales, is looking for candidates to live on her familys island, off the coast of Chile, for six monthsShareCommentsByMari JonesMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsLady Kristyna Drummond-Hay and her husband Michael Lloyd \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAn aristocrat who famously married a Welsh farmer is offering aspiring castaways the chance to live on her familyaposs uninhabited island for six months in a once in a letime opportunity.Lady Kristyna Drummond-Hay, who lives in Llandudno , Wales, with her husband Michael Lloyd, is seeking six conservation students to take part in the all-expenses paid trip.

The former Arsenal and Celtic star labelled her a apossl*tapos, a apossl*gapos and a aposwh*reapos and turned up at her home in Shotts, Lanarkshire, late at night. Jealous Stokes also demanded to know her whereabouts and pestered her mother, May Scott. Stokes, who has a two-year-old son with Miss Scott, appeared at Hamilton Sherf Court and admitted stalking Miss Scott and her mother between July last year and February. Depute fiscal Lynn McFauld said: Contact was made using six dferent mobile phones all attributable to the UK and one which was an international number.  In July she attended at a friendaposs house for a girlsapos night in and received numerous calls, texts, WhatsApp and Facetime messages from the accused but declined to answer them. She was becoming extremely uncomfortable and agitated by this and eventually accepted a FaceTime message hoping thatshe spoke to him he would desist and let her enjoy her night. He immediately demanded to know where she was and who she was with and was clearly angry and agitated. She turned her phone round the room to let him see her friends and later advised she would speak to him the next day but he continued to try and make contact. The court heard Stokes arrived at May Scottaposs home later the same evening and confronted Miss Scott when she arrived home.    Miss McFauld added: She later received a call from her mother saying she had observed the accused going past the house. She was advised he had attended at the side door of the house and was chapping the door and shouting through the letter box but she refused to answer and observed him sitting outside facing the the family home. At am the complaineraposs friendaposs boyfriend arrived back in order to take her home. She advised him to drive her to her front door so she could get in and then she and her mother locked and secured the door. The friend reversed out and observed a door of a vehicle opening which caused him to stop and the accused got out and asked aposwhat is that all about apos.  He started walking towards the vehicle and rattled the window with his fist before demanding to know where the complainer had been and why she was being dropped off. The witness was scared as to what might happen next and drove off but as he did the accused kicked the vehicle. This was observed by the complainer who said her stomach was churning as he approached the house before calling her a sl*g, a sl*t, a wh*re and demanded she open the door. She later sent a message saying aposyou are stalking me, leave me aloneapos and later received an email from the accused saying apossorry for my reaction tonight, I just love you too much and snapped tonightapos. Michael Gallen, defending, said: He was working abroad and that may have contributed to him being isolated and the complainer being alone with a young child which put the relationship under strain.    I have discussed the detail of the case with him and he is embarrassed the way he has behaved to the mother of his child. He has apologised and they are both keen to put this behind them. Sherf Alasdair MacFadyen deferred sentence until September for reports and continued bail. He added: You engaged in a course of conduct that caused fear and alarm to your former partner and her mother.

Over the next hour was a promising pow wow of two like-minded thinkers, who have much in common, including our love of writing, Meghan wrote in the guest editoraposs letter.    But after ing home, Meghan, who was pregnant with Archie at the time, decided she wanted to ask Enninful a aposbold requestapos. So I asked the question, the former actress revealed. Actually, I typed and deleted the question several times until I built up the courage to ask the question in question. aposEdward... instead of doing the cover, would you be open to me guest editing your September issue apos But I am also a little nervous to be boldly asking the editor-in-chief, whom I’ve only just met, to take a chance on me. So Meghan sent the text. And then it appeared, EE’s reply: “Yes! I would love for you to be my guest editor,” she continued. Within a week, Enninful and Meghan were having regular meetings – discussing goals, ideas, who would feature on the cover. The Duchess admitted she had to undergo a crash course in editorial lingo. I was trying to blend in, to keep up with the pace of these seasoned professionals, and to learn as much as I could as quickly as possible, she said. Meghan has also revealed her Vogue journey was inspired by quote in a book she read many moons ago called The Four-Chambered Heart, by Anaïs Nin “I must be a mermaid, Rango. I have no fear of depths and a great fear of shallow living.”  She added: For this issue, I imagined, why would we swim in the shallow end of the pool when we could go to the deep end  A metaphor for le, as well as for this issue. Let’s be braver. Let’s go a bit deeper. That’s what Edward and I have aimed to achieve. An issue of both substance and levity. Describing what readers can expect in the issue, she continued: Throughout these pages you’ll find Commonwealth designers, ethical and sustainable brands, as well as features with designers not about clothes but about heritage, history and heirloom. You’ll also find a beauty section that puts its energy towards internal beauty, celebrating the power of breathing and meditation, and a favourite workout that urges you to use your heart as much as your core.  As you flip the pages, you’ll find familiar faces and names that I hope you get to know a bit better, a bit more deeply, even. And there are less familiar names that you may want to know, such as the women of Luminary Bakery and Tessa Clarke, co-founder of food-sharing app Olio, whom I met with discreetly last year. There are inspiring reads from Brené Brown and Jameela Jamil. You’ll also find a very special piece with Dr Jane Goodall, interviewed by my husband, and a candid and heartfelt conversation between myself and the extraordinary Michelle Obama. But more than anything, this issue is about the power of the collective. In identying our personal strengths, it is anchored in the knowledge that we are even stronger together.  The Duchess admitted there is one caveat in the magazine. It’s still a business, after all, she said.  I share that to manage expectations for you: there will be advertising sections that are requisite for every issue, so while I feel confident that you’ll feel my thumbprint on most pages, please know that there are elements that just come with the territory. The overall sentiment I hope you’ll find, however, will be one of positivity, kindness, humour and inclusivity.

One of the hardest times of the holidays is the kids asking for drinks   snacks every  mins so with this idea they can help themselves.    The baskets will be refilled every morning but once it’s gone it’s gone so hopefully this will teach them not to be too greedy and a have bit of independence. Of course this is alongside breakfast, lunch and dinner and fruit is always available for them to help themselves to. After receiving widespread backlash over the post, Shannon edited it, adding: I won’t repeat myself again! I put this up to try and be helpful, never did I expect it to blow up and me being judged as aposlazy parentapos. I filled the basket with everything I bought as an example for the photo, they will not be getting this much each day - however yes some days they may so shoot me.    Also as stated below there is fruit that they are more then welcome to have and have no cap on hence why it’s not in the basket. Speaking to the Manchester Evening News, the -year-old said: It’s so crazy how much this post has blown up. People shouldnapost be so cruel and judgemental to people behind a screen, their words can be so damaging.

After the treatment, she said the trainee needed to put some pencil in her eyebrows. To her horror Colline then sat up, looked in the mirror and saw most of her left eyebrow was missing. I was mortied, absolutely horried, she said. I said to the girl aposAre you kidding me, is this a joke apos If someone  looked like that, youaposd do a double take. Colline claimed that the worker told her she was sorry and she had messed up. I was in hysteria, crying aposIs anyone going to fix this apos she added. She said another beautician stepped in and offered to fix the waxing disaster. Colline says she was told a bit of tint would help, to which she agreed.    But when she sat up for a second time to look, she said it looked like two thick black slugs had been drawn above her eyes. Colline started to cry and stormed out of the salon and FaceTimed her sister Paula, who was horried by the freakish eyebrows. She tried desperately to wipe the black dye off with wet wipes in her car, but it was too late because the dye had dried and her drawn-on monster brows wouldnapost budge. Because her eyebrows has been waxed, the fix-up job applied the dye straight to her skin. Colline said she had an allergic reaction and her face swelled.Desperate Colline put a post up on Facebook begging for help to fix her botched brows.Iaposm known for being happy-go-lucky and always joking and doing pranks, but I didnapost know what  to do, she said.

Andrews, who had been with Ms Owen for around  years, was taken into custody but died in hospital from natural causes before a trial at  Cardf Crown Court  could begin.  The inquest heard  South Wales Police  detectives were unable to find exactly what was used as a ligature but it was possible a cord of a lava lamp may have been used.The cord was the only object found at the house which fitted with the marks found on Ms Owenaposs neck, the inquest heard. Green marks were also found on Ms Owenaposs face and green paint was discovered on the cord but tests carried out to seeit was the same substance were inconclusive.  On the day of the incident Mr Morris dropped off Ms Owen near her home in Miskin Road at around .am and she walked the rest of the way. Ms Owenaposs daughter Casey Knowlton was asleep in the property when she was later woken by the sound of a loud noise. A statement read to the court said: I could hear screaming and shouting coming from the living room kitchen.  I would describe her screaming like an argument taking place.

The pair had known each other since around August  and after a period of being friends Mr Morris said they became closer. Mr Morris said Ms Owen was planning to marry Andrews in a black wedding dress and felt she owed him for helping her turn her le around. Mr Morris said: She had tried to tell him that their relationship was over but he just was not listening. She felt it was over because it had gone stale and she did not have feelings for him. Ms Owen had spent the night with Mr Morris on the day before she died and they had planned to meet each other later on December . After Ms Owen died Andrews contacted his father and son telling them he had killed her. The inquest heard he called his father Michael Andrews and said: Dad, Iaposve killed Lana. Andrews also rang his son Matt and told him Iaposve killed Lana before adding: Iaposm stood over her and looking at her.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Peter O#Neil edged out Penrice in race one, but Penrice would take his revenge in race two and it was all to play for in the final encounter. Peter O#Neil was up to the task and would take the overall, with Penrice a deserved second and  Damian Carter would third.The four stroke class was enthralling, with Sam Sibbald thundering around the Kilmartin track, big Andy Malloch and his Armstrong chasing him all the way to the flag and winning the final race but not the overall. Sam would be the victor followed by Andy and a consistent Keith Stanford third.For the youth class it was a day of mixed fortunes and consistency would be the key, with Jordan Graham coming out on top ahead of James Forrest and picking up a superb third overall was Rhys Brown.Pre- action would see committee man and track builder Grant McClure and his Maico, with three decades of riding under his belt, become the overall winner ahead of Callum Wilson on the superbly prepared Honda.The Twinshock under cc event would be a three race win for the flying Calum Kilgour and his cc Yamaha ahead of Jim Grieve, who would have some bike issues but would bring home his Honda in second fighting off a very persistent David Lawson and Gordon Peterson but it would be Gordon that would hold the third place trophy with some consistent riding.The Twinshock open class event would be a spectacular sight as cc Hondas and Maicos battled their way around the bracken.In race one there was a very small gap between first and second place and a similarly small gap between third. Brian Alexander would take the win from Craig ‘Smitch’ Smith, and John Crawford would come home in third with a notable mention to the very unlucky Paul Chiappa who had his fair share of misfortunes throughout the day, as his seat was torn from his bike at the top of one of the steep climbs. The overall would end up the same as the first race with Brian, taking the win from Craig Smith and John Crawford bringing the big Honda home in third.In the over s class it was a triumphant day for John Lamont with three resounding victories. Johnny Rutherford was second, a great result for the club sponsor, with David Watson bringing home the Honda with some consistent rides.For the group three races Robert Bell took the honours from Allan Shields and Bryan Colligan, all of these riders deserving a notable mention and with some very similar lap times and some quick racing in trying conditions.The clubman class was great to watch, with some fast up-and-coming riders such as Peter Rennie, Callum Laird and Stuart Wilson all angling for the win. Rennie would take the overall from Laird in second and  Wilson in third.The evolution class was again the Paul and Tom show. In what must have been the fastest racing all day, it would be Paul #PJ# Johnston who would take overall honours with three wins and Tom Grant would take the runner-up slot followed home ably by a consistent Roy Potts taking the third place.In the final block of racing it would be a win apiece for Jordan McDonald, Shaun Robertson, and John Kenny, but it would be the ever improving Shaun Robertson, ing from injury, who would take overall honours from a rapidly improving John Kenny in second and #Mr Consistent# Karl Livingstone in third.Results:Group Pre- class:  Grant McClure  Callum Wilson.

He turned Duncan MacKinnon inside-out before flicking an inch-perfect ball to Fraser Watt on the left of the D and he slammed the ball high into the middle of the goal from  yards to make it -.Lochaber had their first shot on goal on six minutes when Ben Delaney found space on the left but his strike went wide of the left-hand post.Inveraray were showing good movement up front and they increased their advantage on nine minutes. The goal came from a corner and Garry MacPherson caught the Lochaber defence napping as he played the ball low from a wide area towards the front post where full centre Lewis MacNicol waltzed into the box and his first-time shot beat the helpless Callum MacDonald to make it -.Lochaber keeper MacDonald pulled off a great save on  minutes as he blocked Garry MacPherson’s fine drive from the left with his chest before clearing the ball to safety.Lochaber’s Ben Delaney and Stuart Callison tested Inveraray keeper Scott MacLachlan but it was the Winterton side who would add a third goal on  minutes. Again the goal came from Lewis MacNicol winning possession, this time deep in Lochaber territory, and he found the ever-alert Garry MacPherson whose defence-splitting pass picked out Fraser Watt running in unmarked through the heart of the Lochaber defence and he slotted the ball low past the keeper from close range.Lochaber were now up against it but, on  minutes, Conor Sweeney took a corner from the right, sending the ball into the danger-area. Stuart Callison found space to slam the ball goalwards and although Scott MacLachlan saved with his feet, he was unable to get the ball away and Ben Delaney was quick to react as he poked the ball over the line to make it - at the interval and give Lochaber hope.Lochaber started the second period with intent and Scott MacLachlan pulled off a great save to thwart Stuart Callison on  minutes.However, Lochaber’s never-say-die attitude got them right back into the match with just  minutes remaining. Lachlan Campbell played the ball across from the right and it came perfectly to the on-running Findlay MacDonald and his  yard shot from the left flew past the keeper to make it -, setting up a tense finishLochaber had a great chance to snatch a point on  minutes when referee John Angus Gillies awarded them a spot-hit, penalising keeper MacLachlan for a “kick” inside the D. Ben Delaney’s well-struck effort went straight down the middle and MacLachlan redeemed himself, saving superbly with his stick before clearing the ball for a corner.Inveraray saw out the rest of the game to claim two valuable points in what was a cleanly fought contest with no cards shown.The win sets Inveraray up for another crucial relegation battle this time at Kilmallie this coming Saturday.Caberfeidh  Kyles Athletic Kyles Athletic came from behind to beat Caberfeidh - in their pm throw up at Castle Leod.Caberfeidh have been on a bit of a scoring spree of late and they took the lead in the opening minute through Craig Morrison.It didn’t take Kyles long to level with Ross MacRae netting on  minutes and Colin MacDonald’s effort on  minutes meant they went into the break - ahead.Ross MacRae got his second on  minutes with Colin MacDonald doing like-wise with just  minutes remaining.Mowi South Division Inveraray  Kyles Athletic The Inveraray seconds and the Kyles Athletic seconds met in a match originally rearranged Thursday  July which was then put back  hours.Kane Kirkhope was playing in a more advanced role for Inveraray and he scored a well-taken goal in eight minutes after some impressive forward play.John MacKenzie was working hard in the middle of the park and he set up Inveraray’s second goal on  minutes. MacKenzie found Campbell Watt who let go a  yard strike which gave the Kyles keeper no chance.Inveraray sealed both points when Campbell Watt continued his good scoring run with his second goal of the game with  minutes remaining."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes the limit for dancer jessica","story":"Janet WestUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith Highland Games season in full fling, one talented Ardrishaig dancer scooped three first places in three dferent events last week.Eight year old Jessica McCrae, a pupil at Ardrishaig Primary, was crowned winner in the beginners section at Rosneath, Inveraray and Taynuilt Highland Games.

However, this site is unique in Scotland as it represents a very short snapshot in time.#The flint used by the hunters to make their tools would have been collected in the form of small pebbles from the local beaches but because of the general scarcity of flint in Argyll quartz was also used for less fine tools.Towards the Late Mesolithic, around , years ago another band of hunters set up camp at Succoth near Arrochar. The excavation by Argyll Archaeology, for Dunbritton Housing Association, revealed that in contrast to Lochgoilhead, these hunters probably revisited Succoth over  to  year time span and largely made their tools from quartz, presumably because flint was harder to find at the end of Loch Long.Contact Clare Ellis for further information ellisclare@argyll-archaeology or Torben Bjarke Ballin at

sector watchdog, over concerns regarding the purchase of the former Lowood Estate at Tweedbank.Including legal fees and taxes, Scottish Borders Council has spent nearly pound million on purchasing land to the south of the River Tweed with a view to building hundreds of houses and an industrial estate there.The council estimates that developing the estate would cost an extra poundm on top of the price of the land but would potentially generate poundm of gross value added for the regionrsquos economy.However, the SNPrsquos Christine Grahame, who represents Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale at Holyrood, has referred the council to Audit Scotland, which acts as an independent regulator for public sector accounts.Ms Grahame highlights a number of concerns regarding the purchase, including the use of tax havens to purchase the land and the fact that the council paid pound.m for the land, which is more than the UK Governmentrsquos district valuer said the land was worth.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council and its  elected members refuse to tell the Borders general public how much more the council paid for the land, and the authority has rejected freedom of information requests for the valuation figure.The pound.m of taxpayersrsquo money used to pay for the purchase ended up in two Cayman Islands accounts, where businesses do not pay transaction tax.Landowner Alexander Hamilton, who sold the estate to the council, was paid via Lowood Estates Ltd and Genesis Trust  Corporate Services Ltd, both of which are based in the British overseas territory.On the other hand, Borders taxpayers face paying a pound, land and buildings transaction tax, as well as a pound, VAT bill, which along with other fees and charges brings the cost of the purchase up to nearly poundm.Scottish Borders Council also confirmed that the cost of temporary borrowing for the purchase sits at pound,, assuming the loan is paid off over a ten year period.Ms Grahame states: ldquoThere is a very big stushie about the purchase by Scottish Borders Council of Lowood estate, partly because the purchase price appears to have been above valuation.ldquoAdditionally, the Tory-led local authority has paid out to landowner Alexander Hamilton via Lowood Estates and Genesis Trust and Corporate Services, based in the Cayman Islands.ldquoSo the purchase price of pound.m for the  acres of land was not subject to transaction tax.ldquoThis means that Borders taxpayers will be forking out pound, in land and buildings transaction tax, plus a pound, VAT bill, which with other fees brings the bill to some poundm.ldquoThere are also challenges to the housing development planswhich are seemingly light on necessary detail, raising serious questions about this Tory councilrsquos grasp of economic reality.ldquoNever mind, pupils may be able to follow this saga on their pound.m iPads.Ms Grahame also highlights a report from Edinburgh-based property consultants Ryden, which the council commissioned, and a report from Chicago-based property consultants James Lang LaSalle, which was commissioned by Middlemede Properties.Middlemede Properties is an Isle-of-Man registered company which owns the salmon fishing along the bank of the Tweed at Lowood.Ms Grahame continues in her column: ldquoIn the meantime, I have read through reams of material, including both the Ryden report on the purchase and a report by JLL.ldquoMy concerns have, as a result, increased, so I have now reported Scottish Borders Council to the Accounts Commission and as it refuses to publish the district valuerrsquos reporthave asked the assessorrsquos office for sight of that.A spokesperson for Scottish Borders Council said: ldquoElected members considered the Ryden report in full, along with a series of other information, in May  and had access to all this information and more ahead of making the final decision to proceed with the purchase of Lowood Estate in December .ldquoThe acquisition of the site by Scottish Borders Council is part of a long term strategy that will enable appropriate development opportunities to be taken forward by both the private and public sector.ldquoScottish Borders Council remains strongly of the view that the economic viability of the site will best be secured through a joint public and private sector approach and is pursuing that approach as agreed by council last December.ldquoThe consideration of economic viability must not just look at the simple cost of the purchase but also the long-term economic benefits of jobs that will be created during construction phases, through employment as part of its mixed use, and through the provision of homes for both local people and those who wish to relocate to this

It would be hard not to notice the single imposing figure of the dersquoil amongst the floral sea of youngsters.John Cockburn, clad in a black cloak and hood, carried the fiery red head of the dersquoil mounted on the top of a stout pole draped in red cloth. Itrsquos an eerily unnerving sight that Irsquom sure sent shivers down the spine of many since it was carved in .To the sounds of the pipes and trumpets, local bands joined the parade which halted briefly near the top of Waverley Road for Dux Boy Aaron Glendinning to hang a wreath at the wall plaque commemorating John Euman, who acted as Master of Ceremonies at the Cleikum for almost  years.This ceremony was repeated at the plaques on the wall of the Burgh Chambers to former Games Chairman Walker McLaren and John A Anderson, one of the instigators of the Cleikum Ceremony.An act of kindness was carried out at the end of the parade as children handed their flowers to committee members which would be delivered to local hospitals.The procession, which opened the nd Anniversary of St Ronanrsquos Border Games, took the form of a massed bands display. St Ronanrsquos Silver Band and Peebles Burgh Silver Band combined to present a most impressive march along Innerleithen High Street just after the Race Roond the Toon.Large crowds lined both sides of the High Street to witness this spectacle. The march played was The Pride of Princes Street. Huge crowds gathered on both sides of the street to support both of Innerleithenrsquos fine bands and to enjoy the music at this yearrsquos Beating of the Retreat.Presiding over the performance was the President of St Ronans Border Games Alan Patterson along with St Ronan and the Dux Girl, Standard Bearer Ronan Caine and Lass Caitlin Urquhart, their supporters, Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James, and his we Sarah, the monks, and the dersquoil.The two town bands marched on together under the expert direction Band Sergeant David Lindsay playing Scotland the Brave. The Pipe Band then performed an excellent Drummerrsquos Call followed by the traditional Retreat marches Greens Hills of Tyrol, The Battles Oer and Lochanside.Next the Silver Band played an upbeat version of the Queen hit, Fat Bottomed Girls which featured one of the bandrsquos percussionists, Cameron McCreadie, on drum kit and soprano cornet player, Simon Railton, as soloists.The Pipe Band followed on with a rendition of their new competition medley set comprising a iety of time signatures, featuring an emotional arrangement of the slow air Mingulay Boat Song.More marches back and forth had the crowds clapping and tapping their feet before it was time for the combined piece, which was a beautul arrangement of The Rose of Kelvingrove featuring Pipe Major Gillie as soloist. The Silver Band then rendered Sunset with Callum Anderson and Callum Robb sounding the calls. The hymn tune Eventide was played by principal cornet player, Callum Robb, and conducted by Band Secretary Keith Belleville.Games President Alan Patterson then gave permission for the Bands to take their leave. To resounding applause, the bands marched off playing On, StRonans, On!.There was only one important task that remained, the matter of the dersquoil. We were honorary torch bearers lighting the way for our neighbours the St Ronanites, to burn an effigy of the dersquoil.I quickly ran to the High Street for a prime view of the black cloaked carrier of the dersquoil, monks dressed in their habits chanting and punching their croziers in the air, Standard Bearer Ronan carrying the Blue Banner. The magic of this ancient tale was brought to le. I can only compare it to watching the village mob with torchlights off to kill the beast in the classic Disney film.The friendly Innerleithen mob halts on Hall Street and the dersquoil strangely disappears out of sight.I think of the Cleikum Ceremony and remark to my husband, who carried out the duties of the Dux Boy in, how nice it is that the old customs and traditions exist today, said exactly as it was since its inception in .He recalls word for word the outgoing speech of the Dux Boy which makes me think back to the words of Principal Guest Geraint Florida-James: ldquoInnerleithen and the Games will be in your DNA forever. Never a truer word. You can take the man out of Innerleithen but yoursquoll never take Innerleithen out of the boy!We begin the climb of Curly Hill to the soul-stirring sounds of the Pipe Band. It is dark and the fire-lit torches have been extinguished. The climb feels never-ending and locals start to sing On St Ronanrsquos On. We finally reach the top and, as I look out over the valley, it is simply breathtaking. Some things are better felt that telt.My eyes are drawn to the dark figure that sits on the pyre. A haunting figure approaches bearing a flame, St Ronan has ed in the form of Aaron Glendinning. The pyre bursts into flames and the crowds on the hillside cheer the effigyrsquos fiery demise. Fireworks then light up the dark sky.The dersquoil is now in ashes and the evil spirit has been banished once more.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

The th-century handwriting, with its dferent spelling, was very dficult to read in the display case, and so Ros asked the staffit was possible to take the document from the case.A friendly and helpful staff member obliged, then sat down with Ros and assisted her to transcribe the writing. It wasnrsquot easy sometimes they couldnrsquot decipher a word at all, while others seemed to be spelt dferently at dferent times. But gradually, as Ros wrote the words down, she became introduced to Agnes and Elizabeth.There were accounts of others too, but she was particularly taken with the account of these two women, the language used to describe them, and the cruel punishments they suffered.In the account, Agnesrsquos name is spelt in three dferent ways, but was likely Blake or Black.Here is the transcription Ros made:January Agnes Blaik Indweller in Haddington born in the parish of Boulton and Elizabeth Golight, daughter to William Golight, born in this parish being both accused and imprisoned as guilty of lewdness and uncleanliness with many dferent persons. Elizabeth Golight confesses that since Michaelmas last she has been guilty of uncleanliness with several persons and Agnes Blaikie confesses she was formerly convict of uncleanliness and that she was a bad woman ndash But not of late. But acknowledges she lives in a house alone and that there has been dragoons with her in the house. Which being considered by the Magistrates they find Elizabeth Golight is a vicious strumpet and to their certain information Agnes Blaik is a vicious lewd woman. And therefore they ordain both the said Elizabeth Golight and Agnes Blaik be taken to the cross Friday next with the officers and Hangman and there to stand sometime with a paper or sack of theirhellip donating their crime and thereafter be conveyed tohellip with beat of the drum and to be banished forever out of the borough with certicationever they or either one of themto or be seen in this burgh they shall be whipped by the hangman.Signed Andrew Dixon, George Cunningham, Bailies.But it seems the harsh punishment did not prevent them from ing to the town, for Ros came across another two entries:th May Appeared with Janet Golight her mother Elizabeth for repeating acts of lewdness and stealing from Robina Mucklersquos shop. Both found guilty and sent to the House of Correction in Edinburgh to be kept at hard work for  years. Should be whipped by the hangman and burnt on the cheek.th June Agnes Black ed to buy a gown for herself and so was sentenced to be whipped through the town and banished.Ros later sent me her transcriptions, saying: ldquoI love the way Agnes confessed she lsquowas a bad woman ndash but not of latersquo. It rings out over the centuries. And I have a definite dislike for the bailies pronouncing on the lsquovicious strumpetrsquo and the lsquovicious lewd womanrsquo, particularly as there is no mention of any man being named, despite the men being lsquoto their certain informationrsquo!Ros had emailed me the transcription in January  and wrote to me: ldquoI thought it was a tale worth telling and you could weave your magic on it and perhaps find a happy ending.To my regret, I only came across this email last week, as it had somehow remained unopened in my inbox for over two years. I admit to being technically useless on computer matters!But a happy ending  Itrsquos clear both Agnes and Elizabeth had very harsh lives, and on the surface there seems little scope for a truly happy ending.The description of them is misogynistic and full of double standards, as Ros pointed out.So what were these women really like  The writer tries to paint a picture of awful human beings, but the image of poor Agnes secretly creeping back into town, no doubt in a state of desperation, to ldquobuy herself a gown and then being whipped as a punishment gives a dferent story. The punishments for both women are barbaric and utterly unjust.Then I realised that there was a happy ending. That happy ending was in late , when Ros walked into the John Gray Centre and found out about Agnes and Elizabeth. She read the account with human understanding and saw through the prejudice to glimpse at the women themselves and understand just how wrongly they had been treated and judged. And so she spoke up for them and gave them a place in history, while turning the judgment on their accusers.Thatrsquos a happy ending I know Ros would have liked."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-surfer-features-new-advert-carling","story":"The five surfers ndash aged between  and  ndash took on the waves for a national advertising campaign for the beer giant called lsquoMade Localrsquo.Retired roofer Ian McKay, from Whitekirk, was joined by Jason Burnett, Douglas Brown and Dee Ripol, all from Edinburgh, with filming taking place over two days nearly two years ago.

The current law around surrogacy is outdated and doesnrsquot reflect modern medical advances or changes in social attitudes. Surrogacy is a particularly sensitive and emotionally demanding process for everyone involved so we welcome anything which simplies or modernises the legislation. A draft report is anticipated, followed by draft legislation by  but their proposals offer a clear indication about the recommended direction of travel, she says.Parental ordersCurrently, the surrogate, and her spouse ndash she has one ndash are the legal parents of the child at birth and their names are noted on the birth certicate. The intended parents must make an application to the court for a parental order to be recognised as the childrsquos parents, with the legal rights and responsibilities this entails. This can take around six months to process which she points out can pose several potential problems. The first is that while the intended parents are socially and psychologically the parents, that doesnrsquot match the legal position, which can cause identity problems. On the flip side, the surrogate doesnrsquot normally view herself as the childrsquos mother, but the law does. Secondly,the child needs medical care during the first six months of their le the intended parents will likely not have any legal standing to take medical decisions about the young child in their care, which is not on any view a good situation for the child.ldquoAt the moment there is a considerable gap between peoplersquos expectations and the law and signicant potential for misunderstandings. This is not a positive environment in which to welcome a child and we are pleased to see this being tackled as part of the review, says Maciver.She explains that the Law Commissionsrsquo lsquonew pathwayrsquo will have several positive outcomes: it will allow intended parents to become the legal parents from birth in some cases remove of the need for a genetic link between the intended parents and the child in some cases establish a new regulator for surrogacy create a register to allow those born of surrogacy arrangements to access information and for international surrogacy arrangements help those who have a child abroad to bring their child back to the UK with less red tape.The new framework, she says will set out proactive measures including ndashintroducing pre-conception safeguards that are built in before the baby is conceived to help to avoid problems later in the process. ldquoThe proposal is that before the child is conceived there must be a written agreement between the surrogate and the parent, an independent assessment of the childrsquos welfare, the intended parents and the surrogate are all bound to take independent legal advice so that they understand the process, they are all medically screened and criminal checks are carried out, she explains.The intended parents and the surrogate are also required to go to implications counselling to help establish the foundation for an appropriate and positive relationship.Which all sounds like an onerous process ndashbut itrsquos one which Maciver believes will actually signicantly enhance the current situation. ldquoItrsquos more proactive and sees the introduction of meaningful safeguards ndashwhich will hopefully reduce the problems that can sometimes arise after the birth of a child and provide clarity for those entering into a surrogacy arrangement exactly whatrsquos expected of them.The overseas optionOwing to the restrictions on commercial surrogacy in the UK and the dficulty in finding willing surrogates some people choose to go to countries where commercial surrogacy is legally possible ndashwhich often leads to further complications when trying to bring the baby back to the UK.Overseas situations, she says, account for approximately half of surrogacies and they will still have to apply for a parental order, which is also getting an overhaul. For example, currently the intended parents have to apply for that within six months of the child being born, which is a relatively narrow window. The proposal is remove that time limit. They are also proposing changes to make it easier and quicker to get a passport or visa to bring the child to live with them in Scotland. Unlike other areas of family law in Scotland, , surrogacy is an area that has seen cultural attitudes change faster than legislation and Maciver believes that the Law Commissionsrsquo proposals are welcome, though not perfect.While commercial surrogacy is banned, reasonable payments are allowed, which leads to grey areas which the proposals donrsquot yet address, for example, what is reasonable and what strays into lsquopaymentrsquo ldquoThe law in this instance is very dficult to apply, says Maciver. If the payment is higher than reasonably anticipated what options does the court have  There has so far been no refusal of a parental order based on the level of payment but itrsquos probably the most contentious area in the consultation. Itrsquos one in which people hold strong opposing views and so the Law Commissions have canvassed opinion about how these limitations should be set and enforced.Single parentsIn the meantime, though she is encouraged by the fact that in January the law was changed following a challenge to the Human Rights Act  meaning that single parents can now apply for a parental order. ldquoThis was the single most urgent issue: previously only married couples, civil partners, cohabitants or people in other enduring relationships could apply.And the future  Maciver says that there are dfering views about the best route forward ndashand of course the proposed changes are still at consultation stage. But she believes that the new pathwayis long overdue and will have very positive effect, improving the way that surrogacy works and better protecting the interests of surrogates, intended parents and ultimately the children involved.Which is a community whose numbers are fast increasing.Jenner Maciver, is head of family law at law firm Gillespie Macandrew, whocombine specialist, practical advice with a responsive, supportive and discrete service.For more information abouthow Gillespie Macandrew can help please visitwww.gillespiemacandrew"},{"url":null,"title":"first-look-haddingtons-newly-refurbished-swimming-pool","story":"Work got under way at the pool and health suite within the townrsquos Aubigny Sports Centre in April and ndash after a delay ndash the pool is due to re-open on Monday.Essential maintenance and interior deacutecor works have been carried out at the sports centre, off Mill Wynd, over several weeks.During the work, the two pools were drained, with a new light, bright ceiling covering the outdated wood cladding.New lighting has also been installed while the locker rooms have also been given a facelt and tiles have been given a thorough clean.The new-look pool was revealed to enjoyleisure members and politicians on Friday afternoon.The facility is one of East Lothianrsquos original sports centres and originally opened its doors as Haddington Swimming Pool in September .The much-loved site consists of a four-lane swimming pool and East Lothianrsquos only dedicated infant pool.Before the temporary closure, the facility welcomed about , bathers to the pool each week for swimming lessons, AquaFit classes, swimming club training, school and public use."},{"url":null,"title":"pictures-musselburgh-festival-kirkin-sashing-2019","story":"Here are some photos from the events.There are a host of events still coming up: the full list of events during the festival is available here."},{"url":null,"title":"county-talent-fore-fringe-sea","story":"County residents are putting on a large number of shows and workshops over the  days.North Berwickrsquos own historian and author Ailsa Fortune, who will be presenting a talk on the Elgin Marbles, said: ldquoIt is encouraging that the Fringe by the Sea organisers include local performers and authors in their programme ndash itrsquos really good for the collective morale of this vibrant community.ldquoTherersquos always a great buzz about the place when the festival is in full swing.ldquoFor me personally, appearing at Fringe by the Sea is an opportunity to share my work on some of the little-known but intriguing East Lothian characters, like Mary Nisbet of Dirleton, whose lives have influenced our national history, and Irsquom hoping the connection with the Elgin Marbles, currently the subject of international debate, will stimulate lots of interest.Ailsarsquos book, Par for the Ladies, looks at the women who shaped the golfing legacy of North Berwick.

and Daniel McCabe, all , to speak to Prestonpans Community Council about their work and the potential involvement of much younger participants.The school was recently successful in achieving its UNICEF Rights Respecting School gold award, which means that it had proved that it incorporates the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child into the school through both teaching and actions.It now aims to take this further and bring this ethos into the surrounding community.The children were given the chance of addressing the meeting, which included ward councillors Fiona OrsquoDonnell and Neil Gilbert, to ask questions and discuss the best ways to engage young people with what is going on in the community and to ensure their input is noted.The children asked about the plans for the site of the former Cockenzie Power Station and whether more activities for young people such as Rainbows and Scouts could be introduced to the areaWhen addressing the councillors and community councillors, Daniel, a house captain from St Gabrielrsquos, said: ldquoItrsquos important for us at this stage to know what our future is going to hold, and to try and make a dference when and where we can.ldquoTo be involved in the community council in some way would be fantastic, as it would give us comfort to know that the community is being taken care of, as well as what decisions were being made that might affect us.It was decided that the community council would send the agenda for each meeting to the school a few days before the meeting took place so that the children could see it and comment on any issues being raised.The community council said in a statement: ldquoWe would like to thank the four fantastic pupils from St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who attended the community council.ldquoIt was so refreshing to have such polite and knowledgeable young people along to one of our meetings to share their opinions and views on our agenda topics and ask the questions they feel most relevant to their lives.ldquoWe look forward to welcoming them along to future meetings and collaborating with them on the issues that affect all of us living in Prestonpans."},{"url":null,"title":"fringe-sea-q-amp-professor-ben-garrod","story":"The professor is a broadcaster, author and evolutionary biologist at the University of East Anglia and has done a QA to gear people up for his show.Were you interested in dinosaurs as a child Not just dinosaurs, but anything prehistoric. My first fossil find was on a beach near where I grew up. I was five years old and was on a day out with mum and dad. We wound the fossilised shell of a belemnite, which was a relative of the squid we see alive today. It was over  million years old and that blew my socks off! It made me start questioning where all these ancient animals went, why we donrsquot have dinosaurs around now and how the planet could be so old. Obviously, I loved dinosaurs too and loved reading about them in all my old books, imagining what it would be like to see a T. rex walking through my garden.Why are so many children obsessed with them So many people are obsessed with dinosaurs, both kids and adults alike. Itrsquos hard to pin down exactly why we love them so much and I think itrsquos for a few dferent reasons. First of all, when we are growing up we love to learn lots of facts about things . . . the speed of fast cars maybe or the size of planets in space. Dinosaurs are the same and we love to learn how fast an Allosaurus could run or discover which was the biggest. I also think they inspire us through being so big, fierce and scary but we feel safe because we know dinosaurs can never hurt us because theyrsquore all extinct You are described as an lsquoevolutionary biologistrsquo ndash what exactly does that entail Irsquom a Professor of Evolutionary Biology at the University of East Anglia. Sounds fancy doesnrsquot it but itrsquos the coolest job in the world. The lsquoBiologyrsquo bit just means I get to study all sorts of le ndash it could be anything that is alive or was ever alive, so anything from a chimpanzee or a Troodon, to a butterfly or monkey puzzle tree. The lsquoEvolutionrsquo bit means I study how these living organisms change and adapt over time. How does a changing marine environment affect sharks or how does predation from birds affect camouflage in lizards  All these changes are down to evolution. I study le and how it changes, and I share that knowledge with as many people as possible. Being a scientist means you get to study cool stuff like this every single day.How many books have you written I have written six books so far. My series lsquoSo You Think You Know About Dinosaursrsquo are pretty cool, evenI do say so myself. I wanted them to be the most up to date dinosaur books in  million years and although I wanted them to be enjoyed by young readers, the content should be the same as that which I teach to university students. I know young readers really want to learn and we donrsquot need to dumb stuff down, but with a few more cartoons, quizzes and examples, I think they can be enjoyed by young and older readers. Each book focuses on just one species and it was so hard to pick just six. Eventually, I chose Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Diplodocus, Velociraptor and Spinosaurus. Therersquos something there for everyone and between them, these dinosaurs really tell the complete story.Herersquos something we all want to know ndash which dinosaur would have been the most dangerous to humans Arrrrrgh, this is such a tough question. Is one T. rex worse than one hundred velociraptors  Even something like a Triceratops could have been deadly. Itrsquos easier to say which dinosaurs would have been safe . . . there wouldnrsquot have been many. Stegosaurus had tail spikes around one metre long, Ankylosaurus had a tail club which could have destroyed a car and Argentinosaurus weighed so much that yoursquod definitely want to be stepped on. And theyrsquore just the herbivores! Imagine what the meat-eaters would have done.And which was the very biggest Ah, this is a question I get asked a lot. There has been huge debate and even some arguments between scientists. Irsquom not going to give it away ndash yoursquoll have to come to my show and find out. Irsquoll give you a clue . . . itrsquos not the one you think it is.What dinosaurs would have roamed around this country many millions of years ago This is a really hard one to answer for each show right now. We had so many prehistoric species that wersquore spoilt for choice now. We had giant sauropods up on the Western Isles in Scotland, early relatives of T. rex in Wales and even the fish-eating Baryonyx on the Isle of Wight. There are also discoveries of marine reptiles such as the dolphin-like ichthyosaurs and super-predator pliosaurs all around our coastlines all the time. The best thing to do is get out there and go have a look or visit your local museum and discover what used to swim, fly, run and plod around near where you live, millions of years ago.Were numbers declining before whatever environmental catastrophe wiped them out about m years ago and would they have become extinct naturally No, they werenrsquot. The Cretaceous period was the third major period of the dinosaurs and they were doing really well. Some of the most well-known dinosaurs were around right about the time when the asteroid struck. It was also the age of the titanosaurs ndash the biggest dinosaurs to ever live. If that asteroid hadnrsquot crashed into the sea just north of Mexico then in all likelihood, things might have been very dferent and you might really have had a Tyrannosaursus in your garden or a Protoceratops in your playground. But remember, the asteroid did not kill all the dinosaurs . . .Have you ever been on expeditions to find dinosaur remains and where are the places most likely to find them I have. My favourite was when I went with Sir David Attenborough to Argentina to film the discovery and excavation of a true dino giant. The great thing about loving dinosaurs and living in the British Isles is that we have so many fossils of dinosaurs and other prehistoric species. There are certain beaches and riversides famous for fossils and you have a very good chance of finding the fossil bones of a prehistoric marine reptile or shark teeth or ammonite shells. You always have to go with an adult and thoroughly plan your trip because fossil hunting can be dangerous but itrsquos so much fun.Do you identy at all with lsquodinosaur expertrsquo characters on film or television There have been some well-known characters on TV who study dinosaurs but usually theyrsquore rubbish. Look at Ross from Friends . . . Irsquom pretty sure he couldnrsquot tell the dference between the head and butt of a Dreadnoughtus. Characters like that donrsquot inspire me. Real scientists are much better and inspire me every day. The men and women who spend their lives digging up fossils and investigating how these animals and plants lived are much cooler than a TV character."},{"url":null,"title":"music-fan-kevin-proves-39-s-popmaster","story":"Kevin OrsquoDonnell stole the show when he appeared on PopMaster on BBC Radio .A score of  out of  was enough to win the quiz on Ken Brucersquos show.Kevin, who runs his own joinery and garden business, told the Courier: ldquoIt was something that I always wanted to do.ldquoI am right into my music and PopMaster is probably the premier music quiz in Britain.The -year-oldrsquos opponent managed a score of , with Kevin declared the winner and receiving the prize of a digital speaker in the shape of an old-style microphone.The prize has taken pride of place in Kevinrsquos West Barns home, with dozens of people getting in touch with him to offer their congratulations since the show was broadcast.He said: ldquoI met Bruce Springsteen in  in Newcastle and I think this is not quite up there with that but it is not far off.The popular radio quiz has been running for a number of years and each contestant is asked  questions based on popular music from the s through to the present day.He said: ldquoI have listened to Ken Bruce for a good  or  years and the last couple of years I have tried to get on the show.ldquoMy kids have always been saying to me to go.ldquoMy son, Conor, is the lead guitarist in The Tesla Coils and we are always discussing and talking about music.The music fan, who spoke to the Courier as he was en route to see American rock legends Kiss perform at the SSE Hydro in Glasgow, played down his achievement and said the questions simply fell in his favour.ldquoYou can get a possible  points thatrsquos the maximum you can score, said Kevin. ldquoThat is based on  questions and it is just general music knowledge.

The authors, Dr Kath Murray and Lucy Hunter Blackburn argue that in both cases, policy-makers, overly influenced by advocates for the rights of trans people, failed to consider how allowing people to self-declare their gender might affect other groups. ldquoThe analysis hows how decision making has been directed towards the interests of one specic interest group, to the detriment of another, women and girls, they state.Catriona Stewart:Trans rights questions in Yaniv male genitals waxing case must be answered in ScotlandA small number of influential actors appear to have secured a monopoly on how sex and gender identity are understood within Scottish policy-making.The report is not critical of the actions of LGBT groups in lobbying government. \"Lobbying in good faith on behalf of a particular interest group is a legitimate activity in a democracy,\" the authors state.But they claim government should weigh and balance the needs of all interest groups and this has not been done. An example, they say, is the failure to consider whether gender self-ID policies might be \"open to abuse by iniduals with malign intent, irrespective of gender identity\". The authors say \"there is evidence to suggest that failing to anticipate such abuse is naiive\".The article concludes that the Scottish Government should review the adequacy of its institutional safeguards against well-organised lobbying.A spokesman for the Government said the Scottish Government was developing guidance to help realise the rights of both women and trans people and Cabinet Secretary for Equalities Shirley-Anne Somerville had reopened a consultation on its proposed reforms to gender recognition laws.\"The Cabinet Secretary said the Scottish Government would consult later this year on a draft Gender Recognition Bill, and this would include a full Equality Impact Assessment,\" the spokesman added.Read more:Gender self-ID law could run out of timeBut the gender reform debate has been a contentious topic even within the SNP government. This continued last week, when the SNPs National Womenrsquos and Equalities Convener Fiona Robertson faced signicant criticism online, including from SNP supporters, after she described a controversial Canadian trans activist as a ldquofemale predator and said Jessica Yaniv should not be misgendered.Yaniv is a transwoman who has been pursuing a number of businesses offering waxing services to women, after they would not offer the same service to her, because she is male bodied. Feminist campaigners say women should not be legally required to provide intimate services to a male-bodied person who declares they are a woman.Catriona Stewart:Trans rights questions in Yaniv male genitals waxing case must be answered in Scotlandn a debate on Twitter, Ms Robertson insisted Yaniv was a ldquofemale predator and that such people often ldquoused their womanhood as a way to access victims. But critics have accused her of being an apologist for male violence.When the Herald approached Joan McAlpine MSP, she said she had been lsquoinundatedrsquo with messages from female party members who disagreed with the women and equalities convenerrsquos comments. ldquoWhile there are female predators, they are exceptional,\" she said.Ms McAlpine said Ms Robertsons offence was then compounded by saying female predators use their femininity to harm other people. \"That sounds like the assertion a menrsquos rights activist would make, to try and deny male violence by blaming women. No one with any understanding of violence against women and girls would say such a thing and it certainly isnt a feminist argument.\"She added: \"Of course most men donrsquot commit violence against women and girls, but that doesnrsquot take away from the fact that around  per cent of sexual assaults are committed by men as are most violent crimes. Any analysis of society has to recognise that reality. How can you tackle the systemic nature of male violence against womenyou are saying women do this too \"Read more:Gender self-ID law could run out of timeMs Robertsons comments were also criticised by Simon Fanshawe OBE, co-founder of Stonewall, who replied to her: ldquoYou surely understand that this is not about a lsquobad applersquo, itrsquos about precedent. If a male bodied person by self-id info can force women into what is effectively sex workon the basis of identity discrimination that is wholly bad for women.Ms Robertson later claried her statements online, accusing critics of misrepresenting her. ldquoTherersquos absolutely nothing in what Irsquove said that implies sexual violence isnrsquot a gendered phenomenon which is overwhelmingly committed by men, she said."},{"url":null,"title":"dr-punam-krishan-reality-life-scottish-gp","story":"The brief transcript, which Dr Krishan posted on Twitter, read: \"Patient: I dont want an Asian doctor.

So proud of my team.\"The tweet went viral and Dr Krishan, , received messages from as far afield as Argentina, Colombia, Ghana, India, Canada and Australia. Six months later, she remains blown away by the reaction.\"It had an engagement of . million impressions across the world,\" she says. \"I didnt expect it to be as global. It was such an overwhelmingly positive response.\"Dr Krishan, who works as a GP in the East End of Glasgow, has gained a raft of followers who enjoy her warmth, candour and thought-provoking posts on social media where she is an impassioned proponent about the importance of kindness.\"I always say to my medical students and trainees that learning the science is the easy bit,\" she says. \"We can learn from textbooks, absorb the knowledge and spout that out. But it means nothingit is not delivered with compassion and care.\"It is a theme we come back to several times in our conversation. Hearing Dr Krishan talk about her love of being a GP, it is hard to believe she almost never took that path.The eldest of two daughters, she grew up in Glasgow and describes herself as being \"raised on curry and Irn Bru\". Her Indian-born parents arrived from Punjab in the late s. \"We grew up in my dads corner shop,\" she says. \"It was ingrained in us that education was the key to freedom. You were either going to be a doctor, lawyer, accountant or a failure.\"Medicine became an early front-runner thanks to her childhood family GP. \"He was very much a role model for me from a young age because he was the core of our community,\" she says. \"Everyone knew thatDr Kauser saw them, they would be OK.\"A seed was planted for the future Dr Krishan. \"I loved the idea of being able to help and heal people in a community setting,\" she says. \"I admired him and knew education was a must, but then I hit school and everything I loved was wildly dferent to the sciences.\"I enjoyed history and language and music and drama. I wanted to study English Lit, but I was edged into choosing medicine. My mum couldnt understand why I wanted to study English or drama.\":Why we love Glasgows street artHer mother would regularly walk past the University of Glasgow, gaze longingly at its towering spire and tell her daughters that they would one day study there. \"It was almost like she manested it,\" says Dr Krishan, a smile in her voice.\"It was one of her unfinished dreams. My mum had an arranged marriage. She was going to study medicine in India but couldnt because she came to Scotland to be married. Both my sister and I went to the University of Glasgow to study medicine. We are both GPs in Glasgow.\"On paper it sounds like a picture-perfect le trajectory, yet Dr Krishan reveals that in her teens, there was a point when she went off the rails.\"I was a nightmare for my mum and dad,\" she recalls. \"Growing up, I was confused about where I truly belonged. Our summer holidays were always spent in India. I had very much my Indian existence at home, but all my friends were Caucasian.\"There were a lot of restrictions and being told: You cant do this you cant do that ndash what will the aunties think  which I found frustrating. I was always testing the boundaries. I got into trouble at school and was suspended on a couple of occasions.\"When I failed all my exams in third year ndash I got straight sevens in my Standard Grades ndash my mum said she was going to send me to India to finish my studies. She had lost hope. I was given one last chance to turn it around. That was a wake-up call.\"Dr Krishan, who attended Notre Dame High School, knuckled down and achieved the grades to study medicine. \"It was after I became a doctor that I started to feel liberated,\" she attests. \"Then I really felt my wings unclipped after I became a mum.\"The birth of her son Aarish, now six, provided another watershed moment. \"I ended up on a ventilator in intensive care,\" she says. \"My family were told that I didnt have long to live. What happened to me was a complete out-the-blue crisis point in le that gives you a scare.\"She had suffered a postpartum haemorrhage. \"It was a freak, bleed-out episode,\" explains Dr Krishan. \"I went into heart and lung failure, developed clotting issues and widespread sepsis.\"Afterwards, Dr Krishan experienced a le-changing epiphany. \"Everybody around me tried to medicalise me,\" she says. \"Everything was about maybe you need this tablet, when actually all I wanted was support and space to heal. I didnt want drugs to do that.\"I started exercising and eating food to nourish myself inside and out. It is amazing what insights being on the other side of that desk can give you. I ed to work a completely dferent doctor.\"Holistic care is something Dr Krishan regularly applies in her work as a GP. \"I see a lot of poverty and patients living in social isolation, as well as drug misuse. It is quite a challenging population but equally it is a place where you can really make a big dference.\"Around  to  per cent of the things I see as a GP are lestyle-related medical problems. It has become my passion to focus more on the lestyle habits that people form, rather than just the -minute appointment model which is: How can I get you in and out  Can I give you a drug \"She takes her patients on \"Lidl walks\" to share tips on what foods to avoid and how to make healthier choices. Last year, Dr Krishan and a colleague set up Glasgow Wellbeings, a public group where they share their \"health hacks\", which has grown to more than  members.Dr Krishan is married to a fellow GP. \"He started off as an orthopaedic surgeon, but you cant live with me and not become a GP,\" she jokes. Her enthusiasm is clearly infectious, then. \"I would sell it in a jarI could.\"She is currently writing a childrens health book and will make her presenting debut in a forthcoming BBC Scotland medical documentary series due out later this year. Dr Krishan also hopes to pen a memoir about her experiences working as a GP.\"My dream is to write books to help as many people as I can through informed and reflective storytelling in a bid to inspire and empower them along their wellness journeys. I want to bring my Eastern heritage and the wisdom that holds into my scientic Western practice.\":Why we love Glasgows street artThe traditional role of a doctor advocates an evidence-based scientic approach to clinical care. It is important to maintain professional boundaries, yet Dr Krishan strongly believes that patients need compassion too.Such as instinctively hugging a patient who had been diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer. Two weeks later, after the man passed away, his family visited her to say thank you and tell her how much that hug had meant to him.\"Le has been kind to me in that it has taught me lessons ndash sometimes in the most brutal ways,\" she says. \"I have been the vulnerable mum and I have ageing parents, so I understand the pain that brings.

There are two logical options to resolve the current stre a new Scottish leader or an independent Scottish Conservative Party.:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Boris Johnson of lacking guts as he dodges protestersRegardless of personalities, an independent Scottish Conservative Party now seems inevitable after Brexit. Scotland receives billions of pounds from the UK under devolution so the cunning plan of a few million pounds extra to ldquostrengthen the Union is not going to sway voters.

He also demonstrates the propaganda I have come to expect from Brexit supporters in your Letters Pages: \"optimistic and positive\" Mr Johnson versus \"sneering Opposition\", and \"intransigent EU\" being set up as the fall guy for a pear-shaped Brexit.John Connorrequests that Mr Johnson should be given full support, because \"the fact is\" he is so charismatic. Thatrsquos his opinion: the demonstrable fact is that Mr Johnson has been a liar and a cheat does it make it OK that it was done with charisma  And how likely is he to do it again On the same page, Doug Clark adds his weight to the argument. For some reason, he excludes the BBC and press from the media and is unaware that the balance in the written press, overall, is and has been signicantly for Brexit.

Propaganda is defined as information that is not objective, using selective facts and loaded language to produce an emotional rather than rational response.Your three correspondents appear keen to follow Mr Johnsonrsquos lead, \"doubters, gloomsters and doomsters\", with their use of propaganda rather than rational argument.

Its cries of doom are not because it really believes no deal would be \"catastrophic\" but simply as an attempt to use fear to prevent us leaving the sclerotic EU at all. In this it is at one with Europhile doomsters like Dominic Grieve or Philip Hammond.In May  HM Treasury published a report entitled \"The immediate economic impact of leaving the EU\".

The Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy no longer apply ndash the UK Government can support farmers and fisherman in the best way possible.

One such rule is to limit the use of I, a rule I have already emphatically broken and that I will continue to do.Among his other preferred rules is that Mr Rees-Mogg requires all non-titled males to be referred to as \"esquire\" as a sign of respect. There is no female equivalent of esquire but one perhaps must only be grateful Mr Rees-Mogg allows use of Ms. So modern of him.It, as an aside, is an apparent benefit of having Meghan Markle join the royal family that Ms seems now to be used. Previously, the royal household stuck rigidly to Miss and Mrs. I - there I go again - attended the Garden Party at Holyrood Palace a few years ago, taking my mother as a guest.I put our details both as Ms Stewart. The Ms was rejected and our invites arrived bearing the honoric Miss. Ma Stewart was quite affronted at having an important part of her le erased so quickly and completely while I was quite affronted at having my feminist gas put on a peep.When asked about his style guide, the Honourable Member said, \"Its just a thing listing banned words, which are sort of New Labour words like unacceptable.\" He went on, \"If something is wrong, say it is wrong.\"Who can argue. Plain speaking is a gt in modern times. We have so much baffling claptrap to wade through that even simple things can become entirely inpenetrable - plain speak away. At the same time, you also find find people with unsavoury right wing views boast about their plain spoken ways. Boris Johnson and Donald Trump both would pride themselves on being such.This is where the gt element comes in. They believe they are being direct by failing to pause before engaging their gobs. This means we have an instructively clear insight into how their brains work, failing to keep their racism and sexism hidden. Useful.And so to the Leader of the House of Commons, a bit of the plain speaking there too. \"Just\" and \"banned words\" is quite the telling coupling. Banning words should never be prefaced by \"just\". A ban requires a robust defence, something Mr Rees-Moggs style guide is lacking.Yet, Im prone to support a style guide. For someone with a love of language, a style guide is one of the delights of working on a newspaper and something precious, to be protected. Choice of language says much about attitude and influence it is also a connection to the past, a thread running down through the years.One of the my favourite parts of The Heralds house style guide is \"Never use a French phrase when an English one will do just as well.\"Rees-Moggs soi-disant style guide makes me wondersocial media could do with a bit of a style guide too. When heated debates play out in the public realm Twitter is the  for much of these discussions.And yet, instead of debate being nurtured and furthered, the letter limited medium of conversation naturally forces people to use shorthands, usually deeply unhelpful shorthands that only silence, or at the very least, stymie debate.Think pro-le as a term for those who are anti-abortion. It doesnt quite cover it, does it  Pro-lers are hardly pro the mothers le. If American and Republican, they can hardly claim to be pro any le once it is out of the womb and isnt white and or wealthy.Its a disingenuous phrase at best and dishonest at worst.The issue of independence has come to the fore again with a Boris Johnson prime ministerial term and a looming Brexit ing the issue to the public domain. Can we drop terms like Yoon, and Nat  No matter what your persuasion, either one prompts nothing but hackles to rise and thats the last thing we need at what is a crunch time for the country.TERF - with regards the trans rights debate - is another one. TERF is a slur. Others say it is not. No matter whether you agree it is offensive, it is a tool for shutting down debate. It is a form of threat.It is almost impossible for these shorthands to be satisfactorily explanatory of a persons beliefs.They then become offensive and damage debate by reinforcing prejudices.It must be possible to have lively, robust debate without reducing peoples views to pitul stereotypes.It must be possible to take the sting out of the worst of Twitter debate by being allowed and able to name our own viewpoints without being thoroughly dishonest about what those viewpoints are.How about: Never use a reductive label when treating people as iniduals will do.How about: drop labels, use respect."},{"url":null,"title":"alastair-campbell-no-longer-wishes-labour-member","story":"Mr Campbell was expelled from the party in May after admitting voting Liberal Democrat in the European elections as a protest and had planned to appeal against the decision.But in an open letter to Mr Corbyn, part-published in the , the former Labour spin doctor has now said, ldquowith some sadness but absolute certainty, I have reached the conclusion that I no longer wish to stay in the party, evenI should be successful in my appeal or legal challenge.ldquoThe culture you have helped to create has made the party one that I feel no longer truly represents my values, or the hopes I have for Britain, he told Mr Corbyn in the letter, which is also published in full in the New European.Read More:Nicola Sturgeon accuses Boris Johnson of lacking guts as he dodges protestersMr Campbell said he does not blame Mr Corbyn for Brexit, something he ascribed to successive recent Conservative prime ministers and senior Tories, but he said the Labour leader does not understand the gravity of the UKrsquos situation and was likely to lose a potential general election.ldquoI see no sign that you and your office have grasped the seriousness of what is happening, let alone devised or begun to execute a strategy to respond and defeat it, Mr Campbell wrote.Last week, Mr Corbyn said Labour will ldquocampaign to RemainPrime Minister Boris Johnson puts an unsatisfactory Brexit deal back to the public in a second referendum.ldquoLabour will oppose any deal that fails to protect jobs, workersrsquo rights or environmental protections.

People living with dementia might not remember to drink enough liquids to stay hydrated or wear appropriate clothing for the weather.Prolonged exposure to excessive heat can lead to heat exhaustion, with symptoms including headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, intense thirst, heavy sweating and a fast pulse. It can be le-threateninguntreated.Michelle Supple, director of charity services at Age Scotland said: “While many of us are having fun in the sun, it’s important to remember that warm weather can present health risks, especially for older people.“People with heart or lung conditions, those with reduced mobility or living with dementia can be especially vulnerable when temperatures go up. As we age, it becomes more dficult to regulate our body temperature and this can be exacerbated by some medications.“It’s important to take simple steps to stay cool, including drinking plenty of fluids, limiting strenuous activities, and staying inside during the warmest part of the day. It’s also vital to protect your skin by using sunscreen and covering up with a wide-brimmed hat and loose-fitting clothes.“We would encourage everyone to check on older neighbours, friends and family to make sure they are doing well and seethey need anything. Something as simple as helping open a window or popping to the shops to pick up some sunscreen can make a huge dference to someone’s comfort and well-being.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They must be allowed to remain so.“Scotland faces plenty of health challenges and I suggest that we focus on those rather than getting side-tracked by a suggestion like this which is obviously going nowhere”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Volunteer cleaners become citizen scientists, as they also record the litter they find along a designated m stretch of every beach that’s cleaned, and it’s this aspect that has helped MCS change policy and behaviours over the last  years.“Now more than ever is the time to turn awareness into action,# says Catherine Gemmell, MCS Scotland conservation officer. #Everybody is talking about marine litter — you see it on the TV, hear it on the radio and read it in the papers and across social media. We want people to take that awareness and turn it into action by taking part in the biggest beach litter survey and clean up in Scotland! Only by combining awareness with action and data can we make sure that industry and government put in place the urgent measures needed to stop this plastic tide for good.”The p carrier bag charge, a ban on microbeads in wash-off products, consultations on a plastic tax, commitments to depositschemes, a ban on plastic stemmed cotton buds in Scotland and the banning of lantern and balloon releases — have all come about following compelling evidence gathered over decades by volunteers at MCS beach cleans. Cleaning and surveying a beach only takes a couple of hours at most. Each beach has a coordinator, who explains how to fill in a simple data form, and then it’s just a case of grabbing a litter picker and a bin bag and filling it up with rubbish.“Beach litter is a serious environmental problem,” says Lizzie Prior, MCS Beachwatch Officer.“But the solution is in our hands. We want the th Great British Beach Clean weekend to be the biggest ever. The BBC’s Blue Planet II and subsequent programmes have given the UK public a real understanding of the pollution crisis facing our oceans and now people want to make a dference. The more volunteers we have, the better it’ll be for our seas.”To get involved, call   and find out how you can organise your own.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Sadly, many are under threat from coastal erosion and the effects of climate change.“SCHARP is doing brilliant work engaging communities with this issue and working to identy and protect sites across Scotland, including a number here in Orkney.  Without the work of volunteers, however, this would simply not be possible. Those who get involved, devoting their time, energy and local knowledge, are due an enormous debt of gratitude.“For example, volunteers in Sanday helped to move and rebuild eroding structures from the Meur Burnt Mound to the local heritage centre, preserving an important cultural and historical attraction. This is just one example of the invaluable work carried out by volunteers that will allow current and future generations a better understanding of their heritage.“I know there is similar great work being undertaken in communities across Scotland and I’ve written to my MSP colleagues encouraging them to find out more about what is happening in their constituencies and regions. The summer recess provides a perfect opportunity to get out and learn more about these projects and the volunteers that make them possible.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But how can those words be justied Well, the first bit is easy. We have just witnessed the th match in the series and from an Orkney point of view the game and outcome were ‘glorious’. But they haven’t all been like that. Amidst many dazzling encounters there have been some dull, tepid affairs which have failed to raise the pulse rate for supporters of either hue.Ah, but that’s all right. Teams are allowed the odd blip or series of blips, safe in the knowledge that the deep sense of history and tradition built up over a long period of time will cover it. No lasting damage will be done to something so enduring as the annual Milne Cup fixture which is ingrained into the culture of the Northern Isles. It is a game like no other and to play in it represents the pinnacle of most players’ footballing ambitions.So, look at it like this. Despite what those from other sporting disciplines might say, football is the ‘glorious game.’ Orkney versus Shetland is our own ‘glorious game.’ And we have just reached number one hundred. Straightforward really!Now, feel free to open the covers and follow the story . . . so far. Experience the ups and downs, intrigue and controversy of more than a century of inter-county football.

So now is a good time to ask some fundamental questions about what kind of future we want for tourism.A revamp of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy is under way it will be launched in six months’ time setting out actions planned for the coming decade. Are the right questions being asked  Are the voices of citizens and residents being heard CNN Travel recently identied Edinburgh, alongside Barcelona, Venice, Rome and Amsterdam as global “hotspots” for “overtourism”. The helter-skelter, sky’s the limit, tourist boom we are living through represents a considerable success not just for the tourist industry, but also its partners, the Scottish Government and our local city council. Tourism is seen by the Government as Scotland’s most important industry, employing , people, providing one in  of our jobs, though contributing a less impressive six per cent to the national economy. Edinburgh is crucial to Scotland’s tourism. In , the city accounted for  per cent of overnight trips by overseas visitors to Scotland, and  per cent of all overseas visitor spending in Scotland. For unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website here: Edinburgh’s tourism industry urged to act to avoid ‘backlash’With a   per cent split between visits from March-October and the rest of the year, tourism is also less seasonal in Edinburgh than in rural Scotland. Edinburgh’s  tourism strategy sought to increase the number of visitors to the city by a third between  and , from . million a year to . million.By , it was ahead of that target and the “stretch target” was upped to . million a year. So, simultaneously, Scotland’s tourist industry and the revenues it generates for government are dangerously over-reliant on Edinburgh, but also umbilically tied to the city’s further tourist growth. A policy for tourism in Edinburgh is a policy for tourism in Scotland, and vice versa.Amidst economic uncertainties about Brexit, government and the industry will cling to the comfort blanket of growing tourism in Edinburgh. The plunging pound makes Scotland more affordable for international visitors, but Brexit poses problems for tourist businesses, including visa uncertainties and the end of EU-wide free movement in a sector that relies signicantly on non-UK EU workers, and has a disproportionate percentage of employees earning below the living wage. In addition, the prolonged and continuing period of austerity has drained the capacity of local councils to maintain, let alone enhance, the public realm and its attractiveness, not just to residents but to visitors also. Globally, tourism demand is expected to accelerate in the medium term. Therefore, there are good grounds for expecting the number of tourists coming to Edinburgh to continue to increase, and for businesses and government policymakers to seek to attract new visitors, particularly from emerging economies experiencing rapid growth of middle-class incomes and lestyles.A global economic recession may yet blunt the momentum, but this is the lens through which preparation of Edinburgh’s tourism strategy for the next ten years is being viewed. The work is being led by the Edinburgh Tourism Strategy Implementation Group , which has operated since . Its members include Edinburgh council leader Adam McVey and councillor Donald Wilson, convenor of the Culture and Communities Committee. Then there are three senior officials – the chief executive, Andrew Kerr Paul Lawrence, director of place and Jim Galloway, from economic development. Apart from the director of the National Galleries, the other eleven members are from Scottish or local tourism and marketing bodies, including Scottish Enterprise, VisitScotland, Edinburgh Airport, and industry organisation the Edinburgh Tourism Action Group. Though its built and natural environment is Edinburgh’s major attraction, there is no official from Edinburgh’s planning department on the SIG, nor any representation of the conservation or community bodies in the city.Effectively the industry is in charge of making policy for the city, with planning and citizens consigned to near irrelevance. The city council is there as a corporate entity to help tourist businesses to realise their dreams. A key principle of the SIG is stark: “Decisions by the SIG are made for the benefit of the tourism sector in Edinburgh.” Chaired by the council’s chief executive, SIG declares, without any caveats, that it works by “championing the strategy at a senior level” and “aligning the strategy and member organisations’ activity to be inclusive, complimentary and mutually supportive”.The idea that the city council exists to represent and serve the citizens, rather than to give unconditional support to some private businesses and investors, may seem quaint. Similarly, the thought that the council, as the local planning authority, has a duty to take decisions in the public interest, respect the multiple heritage designations that apply in central Edinburgh, and refuse permission for inappropriate development, sits uneasily with an absolutist pursuit of growth in tourist numbers and the infrastructure of hotels, transport, events etc that such growth requires.These concerns about governance and accountability matter since tourism-driven development in Edinburgh has become fiercely contested, just as it has in those other “over-tourism hotspots”. The fate of the old Royal High School and its setting on Calton Hill now rests with Scottish ministers. Will they allow a large hotel to despoil one of Scotland’s most emblematic cultural assets  The planning permission for another large hotel at India Buildings was strongly opposed by the local Old Town community and others dismayed by its impacts on the Central Library. Loss of accommodation to commercial, short-term holiday lettings, and consequent rent increases, is provoking a backlash.The question that needs to be asked is not “how can we attract as many tourists as possible ” but rather “how can we manage tourism so that it does not destroy our city and communities ”Industry advocacy needs to be balanced against evidence of capacity constraints, and a proper heritage assessment that is taken seriously by officials and politicians.Clf Hague is chair of the Cockburn Association©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit talks with eu on hold as no deal preparations get 1bn boost","story":"The UK government will dramatically increase spending to prepare for potentially crashing out of the EU, including erting # million for an advertising campaign to raise awareness ahead of a no-deal Brexit, it has emerged.Chancellor Sajid Javid will unveil a £ billion boost to spending for no-deal this week as ministers respond to orders from Downing Street to “turbo-charge” preparations.It came as Downing Street confirmed there would be no face-to-face meetings between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and EU leaders, despite invitations from Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, until they agreed to re-open the Withdrawal Agreement and abandon the Irish border backstop.A spokeswoman indicated Mr Johnson believed Brussels would blink first in the Brexit stand-off. “He has been clear that the backstop will be abolished,” she said.“He remains confident the EU will stop claiming that the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be changed, but until that happens we must assume there will be a no-deal Brexit on  October and the government’s central focus is preparing for that.”Speaking in Scotland on his first visit north of the Border, Mr Johnson tried to distance himself from comments by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, Michael Gove, who said at the weekend the government would “operate on the assumption” the EU would refuse to concede.And Mr Johnson said the UK would be “reaching out” and was “not going to be aloof or wait for our friends to come to us”.But the intensity of the government’s focus on no-deal preparations was confirmed yesterday with the first meeting of a new Cabinet Exit Strategy committee, known as XS, which will be chaired by the Prime Minister, but was led in his absence by Mr Gove.Mr Gove will lead another committee on a permanent basis, aimed at providing daily updates on overall Brexit preparations to ministers and officials.The ‘daily operations’ group, codenamed XO, will operate out of the room that normally hosts Cobra, the UK’s emergency situation committee. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab – one of the members of the XS – said the  referendum result was an instruction to leave the EU with or without a deal. “The mandate certainly wasn’t to leave the EUthe EU let us, it was an in out referendum and we made clear, those on the campaign, that we should strive for a good deal, butthat wasn’t available, that we should go on and make a success of Brexit,” he told the BBC’s Today programme.Speaking in Scotland, Mr Johnson said: “My assumption is that we can get a new deal, we’re aiming for a new deal.“But, of course, Michael is absolutely right that it’s responsible for any government to prepare for a no-dealwe absolutely have to.”Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was “disgraceful” to spend the money on advertising for a “totally avoidable” no-deal Brexit while “four million people are in deep poverty”.“Boris Johnson knows no-deal will cost jobs, but the Tories only care about the wealthy elite who fund them,” he said.SNP Treasury spokesperson Alison Thewliss said a £m advertising campaign was a “shameful waste of taxpayers’ cash”. “Boris Johnson has no mandate in Scotland,” she said. “We didn’t vote for Brexit and we didn’t vote for this Tory government.“With public money being thrown down the drain, the Tories must explain why Scottish taxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for a Brexit we do not want.”Mr Johnson’s failure to contact Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar since taking office was branded “discourteous and offensive” by Sinn Fein yesterday.In recent times, incoming UK prime ministers have placed a call with their Irish counterpart on the first day of assuming office.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr Johnson of “snubbing” Mr Varadkar.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said. There was speculation that a phone call between the two leaders could take place last night.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish poverty levels rise after 10 year decline","story":"The rate of poverty in Scotland has risen to  per cent, climbing for the first time after a decade of declining rates.A Social Metrics Commissionstudy indicates the rate of poverty in Scotland increased slightly for   in an alarming result after “a steady downward trend for more than a decade”.It is the same rate as Northern Ireland and higher than the south-east of England , but lower than Wales , Londonand the UK average .The report suggests  per cent of single Scots are in poverty while the rate is  per cent for lone parents.Couples with children have a  per cent poverty rate compared to  per cent for couples without children.The report says: “Compared to the UK average, poverty rates are generally higher for people living in Wales and lower for those living in Scotland and Northern Ireland.“Overall poverty rates in England, Northern Ireland and Wales have broadly followed the overall trends in the UK poverty rate, falling slowly in the early s, rising during the financial crisis and recession and then falling post-recession.“Changes in Scotland have been dferent, where up to   the poverty rate had been on a steady downward trend for more than a decade.“However, in the most recent two years of data, the poverty rate in Scotland has risen.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard criticised Boris Johnson over the figures on the day he visited Scotland for the first time as Prime Minister.He said: “On the same day that old Etonian Johnson visits Scotland, this is a reminder of what the Tories have done in power.“They are the party of the few, not the many – and their callous austerity agenda over the past nine years has caused nothing, but misery for people across Scotland and the UK.“Scotland needs radical change, and Labour governments at Holyrood and Westminster that will raise the minimum wage, invest in vital public services and raise the standard of living so that the scandal of poverty is eradicated from our society.” Overall there are . million people in poverty in Britain, including . million working-age adults, . million children and . million pension-age adults, the report said.Seven million people, including . million children, are classed as in persistent poverty, defined as being in poverty for at least two of the previous three years.Nearly halfof people in poverty, totalling . million, live in a family where someone is disabled.The poverty line in the UK is defined by one common measure as those earning  per cent of the median income, but the SMC uses a dferent poverty threshold it defines as being people living below  per cent of the median of what it calls total resources available, including income, assets and costs such as housing and childcare.The SMC said its findings highlight the scale of the challenge facing Mr Johnson in tackling poverty across Britain.SMC chairwoman Philippa Stroud said: “It is concerning that overall poverty has remained at almost the same level since the early s, under governments of all colours.“But it is also clear that beneath the surface there are signicant dferences in the experience of poverty among dferent groups of people.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Other events of similar size # even in less challenging locations than Lewis # have come and gone. But the HebCelt remains, steadfast and loyal in the face of changing fashions and changing economic demands.Without the Celtic element, it#s doubtful it would have been able to survive, but as it is it offers something unique in the Scottish music events calendar # both in the kind of acts on show and the setting, with a floodlit Lews Castle over-looking the main site, giving it an ambience all of its own.With up to  acts on show, performing from early afternoon to late at night, it once again provided a veritable feast of Celtic and traditional music. Now some may quibble that the music of KT Tunstall, the headline act, is not Celtic in nature # more pop-rock maybe # but the LA-based singer-songwriter is most certainly Scottish. And she got married in Skye, so that#s enough.Maybe the biggest testament to this year#s festival is that the internationally-renown performer, with a string of hits and albums to her name, did not steal the show as you might expect.Instead the talk of the tent was on the performances from the likes of Elephant Sessions the country and western outfit of The Shires # always likely to prove a hit at an island event # and west coast favourites Manran and Tide Lines.And, of course, there#s the strange phenomenon that is Peat n Diesel, three unassuming local characters whose tongue-in-cheek lyrics # like #Calum Dan and his Transit van# # have captured a mass following, particularly among the youth. They were first scheduled to play in the small acoustics before the hordes of disappointed followers, who were simply unable to get near, persuaded the festival organisers to give them a last-minute billing on the main stage. It was again a hoot, and maybe it#s true after all that #that#s the way we do it in the Western Isles#.But perhaps the real beauty of the HebCelt is that it is about far more than what happens at the main site. From Wednesday to Saturday the town was alive every night into the small hours of the morning. No doubt bar and hotel staff were exhausted in the aftermath, but rather delighted in the sharp spike in takings.The truth is that, while tourist numbers coming to the island are on the rise, the local economy is not performing great. Jobs are scarce, depopulation of the more rural communities re. So the estimated £ million that the HebCelt generates is more than welcome, as well as providing a brief respite from reality and a sense of something major happening on the doorstep. But just like the visit of old friends tends to be too brief, so there is already a longing for next July."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2465-Raasay.jpg","title":"recruitment drive to restore nursing cover for","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe move, which is part of the recommendations outlined bySir Lewis Ritchie in his out of hour health care report for Skye, Lochalsh andSouth West Ross, intends to end a period of four years in which the island hasbeen without an overnight nursing presence.In its advert, NHS Highland states: “Professor Sir LewisRitchie#s Report of May  into out of hours care in Skye, Raasay and SouthWest Ross has enabled a move towards innovative healthcare here when he saw theneed for equity of access to services even where numbers are relatively small…“Raasay offers a rare opportunity to provide cradle to gravepersonal nursing and primary care with continuity while working as part of amutually supportive team.”The chosen applicants will have a “considerable degree ofautonomy” and would liaise with “colleagues and line manager based in NorthSkye and with access to support from GPs in Portree and Rural Practitioners inMacKinnon Memorial Hospital, Broadford when required.”The band six positions at a salary scale of £, # £, per annum are permanent with both full-time and part-time hours available."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/LOCHCARRON-GAMES-1-adj.jpg","title":"number 41 in the sun for lochcarron highland","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.Sinclair Patience of Tain and Angus Davren of Conon Bridge excelled at the st edition of the games as they wrote their names into the record books.Angus Davren hit new heights as he cleared . metres to set a new ground record in the high jump.

While many people can fondly remember hearing its call in years gone by, Rathlin is the only place in Northern Ireland where the birds have been heard in recent years.A male has been heard calling in one location on Rathlin each year since  and now RSPB NI staff have recorded two breeding males in two separate sites on the island this summer.Known for their unmistakeable ‘crex-crex’ call, corncrakes are highly secretive and like to settle in early growing tall vegetation like nettles, cow parsley and irises. One of the sites - in Church Bay - is on land owned by an islander but managed by RSPB NI that has had nettles planted by staff and teams of volunteers to encourage the birds – summer migrants from western Africa – toto Rathlin.RSPB Rathlin Island Warden Liam McFaul said: “It’s fantastic and really encouraging that the work we’re doing for corncrakes is making a dference. It’s been an exceptional year because for the first time since the s we have two calling corncrakes and this is brilliant. The birds have two broods and the second brood will be hatching in late July.”Corncrakes are rarely spotted but the Church Bay male bird has been calling during the daytime now since mid-May and has come out into the open on occasion and has even been captured on camera.Liam has a theory about why the bird is so vocal and has been spotted moving around.Liam said: “He has been calling out in two or three dferent locations and then he’s moving across the road to the other side and is calling quite a lot, all night long and quite often during the day.“Because of this behaviour, this could indicate that there could be more than one female in that area and he’s tending to two areas at once. But because the females are silent, we don’t really know.”The second male corncrake has been recorded on private land owned by wildle-friendly farmer Richard Green and his family on the western end of Rathlin.Liam McFaul believes theof a sustainable corncrake population would be a huge boost for the island.One person treated by emergency services after dramatic Lough Neagh rescue - jet ski not seen for more than two hours Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"“Hopefully we will see their numbers increase and get a sustainable population, with four or five pairs regularly breeding, and this feels more achievable after this landmark year. Each breeding pair can produce up to  eggs each breeding season, although there is a high mortality rate with these birds. Increasing corncrake numbers could be a big tourism benefit for Rathlin. People travel to Tory Island in Donegal just because of the corncrakes there,“ he said.Liam said that RSPB volunteers have played their part in this conservation success story on Rathlin. “We’ve been creating areas of early cover over the last  years or so. This has involved teams of volunteers on the mainland over the winter digging up nettle rhizomes because that’s ideal habitat for corncrakes.

It shows us we must be doing something right for them. The way we farm, we’re sensitive to nature and the birds and we try to do whatever we can to help.”After the second brood hatches later this month, the birds will migrate back to Africa in August or September.Corncrakes are easily spooked, so members of the public are asked not to try and get close to the birdsthey hear their call as they are on private land and it is also important that the birds are not disturbed and that this sensitive conservation effort is not compromised.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1985871.jpg--.jpg?1563356127000\n","title":"council to honour ww2 veterans with silver poppy gift","story":"WHILE urging Mid  East Antrim Council to honour the last surviving veterans of World War , DUP councillor John Carson reflected on the cost of that global conflict to one local family.Proposing a motion that each surviving veteran in the area - from across the services and the merchant navy - should receive a silver Poppy of Remembrance in November, Alderman Carson said it was also fitting to remember those who had made the supreme sacrice especially with the th anniversary of the outbreak of war looming.

The play shows a time in history of the bitterness of some people captured through Marie’s writing during that football match. I know there is a percentage on both sides of people who still hold a bit of resentment but hopefully the majority of us have moved on and this piece shows what can happen when we do move on.“This is the first time I’ve done something like this, something on this scale, and it’s the same show, basically on people’s doorstep at the Devenish. We finished a fantastic run at the Lyric Theatre, the Féile is also part of our tour before we head to Derry. The Irish Arts Centre in New York came to see it in the Lyric and there is talk of taking it over to the States for the Irish Arts Festival in February.”Gerard continued: “If people with tickets for the s Night which is happening as part of Féile want to come to the show first, then we wanted to put it out in the Andersonstown News that they can get a ticket half pricethey show their ticket at the door or contact us via sodabreadtheatre@gmail – we can give them a code when booking.“We are really looking forward to bringing the piece to the Devenish and hearing people’s reaction to the work.”A Night in November will be performed at the Devenish Complex on Sunday, August .

Last year Unite called a protest against the price hikes and attacks on workers’ pay and conditions on the peaceline which drew signicant cross-community support from both the Shankill and Falls. Working class people are united in their opposition to the council’s austerity-driven policies on leisure services.“Belfast City Council voted to outsource leisure services to this company – they cannot wash their hands of the consequences of that for either the public or their former employees. We call on all parties to reconsider their positions and bring these public services back in-house and give all the GLL workers a decent pay uplt.”A spokesperson for GLL said the company would meet union representatives to “understand the issues they have”.“GLL remains committed to genuine engagement on these matters in the interests of all parties, and to ensure the seamless provision of services across all of our leisure centres,” the spokesperson added.A Belfast City Council spokesperson said: “Belfast City Council is disappointed to learn that strike action is being considered at the city’s leisure centres.

As of February , Ulster GAA have submitted its revised Casement Park planning application with a reduced capacity of ,.Speaking after a round of top level meetings this week, Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News: “I met with the DfC on Monday and I’m in constant contact with the Department for Infrastructurewhose Permanent Secretary, in the absence of a department minister, will make the decision on planning for the project. “I met with the Ulster Council in Armagh on Tuesday, and have been meeting with all the stakeholders with regards to Casement Park for a long, long time.“There are around £ million of additional costs to the Casement Park project due to time delay and change of design. DfC are working on the business case to try and find where that additional money will come from. Once the planning decision has been made it means we won’t be sitting further more years waiting on the business case being drawn up,” he said. Mr Maskey said he would be “very disappointed”the planning decision was not made within the next five months. “In all likelihood, in the absence of a minister, it will be DfI’s Permanent Secretary Katrina Godfrey making the decision.”When asked what would he say to those in the community who think Casement will never be built Mr Maskey said: “We are pushing for Casement to get built – I can understand that people say this will never be done because its been frustrating for so long, it has taken all these years to get the project to this stage. “I think the negavity around the project has reduced over the years. The new design has come in, there has been a lot of hard work done behind the scenes to try and get this major investment for West Belfast through. “The GAA have assured us that all the information needed is all in, that there are no outstanding issues at this stage. “There should be nothing that stalls this project back any further.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"reaching new musical heights at the earagail arts","story":"THE Earagail Arts Festival runs every July and brings a wealth of talent to Donegal’s Wild Atlantic Way.The festival has been running this year from July  and will wrap up its calendar of events for another year on Sunday, July . With Belfast’s love affair with Donegal well established, what was once a well-kept secret among the country’s festival-goers is now well and truly on the radar for Belfast music and arts lovers and this year they have been spoiled for choice.At the weekend the festival moved to Arranmore Island for what was billed as the Mór Music # Arts Trail – two days of music, comedy and the spoken word.Crossing over on the Blue Ferry from Burtonport at lunchtime on Saturday passengers were already getting in the mood for the weekend ahead. It was only later that we realised some of them were the artists whowould grace the stage later in the day.Proceedings soon got under way amid the intimate surroundings of Neily’s pub. This is one of the attractions of the Earagail Arts Festival: organisers bring together some of the most talented musicians and artists from around the country and put them before an audience in an accessible setting. Saturday afternoon did not disappoint, with the talented Oscar Jennings – just turned  that day – who, with a mature acoustic set, belied his tender years. The young singer-songwriter had Neily’s in the palm of his hand. Look out for his distinct voice in the years ahead.Conor Mason – also from Derry – and Leila Jane followed, and again their acts were faultless. Switching from guitar to keyboard, Mason’s voice is melodic and haunting, his love songs touching the soul. Singer-songwriter, -year-old Leila Jane from Donegal, once more exemplied the depth of talent in the Irish music scene with hints of Janis Joplin and Patsy Cline hovering above her blues six string.The night was but a pup and we moved on to Early’s pub. Ahead of us –we could stick the pace – was Eve Belle, Delta Fuse and Accidents in the Workplace. A self-proclaimed “singer of sad bops” Eve Belle took us on a journey through the consequences of le. A woman of immense song-writing talent, she’s another one to check out. The evening was brought to a crescendo withblues rock four-piece Delta Fuse from Derry – boy, there’s some talent in Derry these days – and funkmeisters Accidents in the Workplace from Dundalk.After lunch it all began again on the Sunday with more music, this time at The Crossroads. We arrived just as the highly-rated Josie Duncan was wrapping up. However, we would catch-up with the Scots Gaelic singer back in Early’s later. Also playing at The Crossroads was Thatcher of the Acropolis with their unique blend of electronic rock and Gaelic poetry. After a trad session in Phil Ban’s – which coincided with Shane Lowry’s Open win on the big screen – the island was really rocking now, and it was soon back down to Early’s for the final evening. When Dublin poet Stephen James Smith announced from the stage that he would be reading poetry for the next  minutes, there was some uneasy shuffling in the seats, but we needn’t have worried, he had us laughing and crying in equal measure with his poems and stories. Incidentally, Stephen is playing in the Black Box in Belfast on October . Make sure you go along. I’ll be back.Following Stephen we were treated to the haunting Gaelic sounds of Diane Cannon and Manus Lunny, followed by Clann Mhic Ruairi. Another rousing ending to another Arranmore evening was brought courtesy of the impressive Honeyfeet.You can check out the final weekend of entertainment at the Earagail Arts Festival at eaf.ieWe stayed on Arranmore island at Early’s Bed # Breakfast where you will get a great welcome from Jerry and his we Pat.We travelled to Arranmore Island on the Blue Ferry – https:arranmorefastferry tickets "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"sailin away on the crest of a wave","story":"TO understand today’s music scene in West Belfast you have to go way back to brass, reed and silver bands. There were  children in our house, a sure sign you were from the Falls during the s, and St Peter’s Brass and Reed Band and St Paul’s Silver Band featured prominently in our lives.Members of St Peter’s Brass and Reed were affiliated with the Irish Free State Army where they were assigned to the Infantry so they could play in the Army Band. With names like Johnny McCorry, Pat Campbell, Fr Montague et al teaching them the ropes,it was no wonder that most of the Morgan brothers like Pat, Tony and Tom went on to make music a big part of their lives. Tony was a member of ious swing and brass bands while Tom, Pat and his we Ann started The Ballymurphy Martyrs Flute Band which then split to form Éire Nua. Another band on that scene were the Tom Williams Pipers, I’m sure our readers know more.Trombones and French horns, tubas and clarinets were all over our Beechmount house, with band unorms hanging over doors and music stands taking up precious space. We were all encouraged to learn an instrument as our clarinet-playing father Paddy Morgan thoughtwe were ever out of work, especially being Catholic, we could always busk and have our music to fall back on.During the late s through to  our Tom was in a band called ‘The Livin’ Thing’ named after Seamy and Roy Cassidy’s love of ELO. Also in the band with Tom, Seamy and Roy were Angela Hayes, John McKavanagh, Jim Hughes, Willie McAllister and Conor McHugh who has played for Katmandu, The Adventures and many other bands looking a genius keyboard player.Other bands doing the West Belfast circuit during those times were Brendan Hayes’ band The Dodgers, The MSJ Band, Sunshine, The Starjets, Katmandu, the mighty Avalon, Paris, Luv Bug, Kozee, The New Dimension, Glenties Folk Group, Alec Matthews Quartet, Blackwater Boys, Freemen, Baraka and the Rollie Stewart All Stars – and they all played anywhere they could get a booking. Places like The Green Briar, Terry McDermotts, The Sloan’s Club, Market Social, St Matthew’s, Donegal Celtic, The Old Burnt Cabin , Pound Loney Social Club, Andersonstown Social Club, Arlington House , The Inn Place , The Clubhouse , Beacon’s , Pass ‘n’ Grove, The Trocadero, Rossa, Chluain Árd and the infamous Lake Glen Hotel. These nights were usually followed by a fish supper from Aldo’s.During the dark days these groups gave people something to look forward to at weekends, sometimes taking big risks in travelling to ious places usually in clapped out cars, nearly always getting stopped and sometimes getting caught up in tragedies happening on the road. In  Tom was in a car accident near Dundalk. He was transferred to Jervis Street Hospital in Dublin where he died aged just . I know Tom’s family will feel proud when we hear about the talent that stemmed from West Belfast on st August as part of the Andersonstown News’ Greatest Hits Night when we’ll be celebrating the music of those days and remember Tom and all the people who kept the music going during our darkest times – we might even get a fish supper in Aldo’s afterwards!• Jog any memories  Let us know anybody or any place you remember through Text  or email Cathy at c.dobbin@belfastmediagroup"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland nurses set to vote on strike action over pay and conditions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Whilst this remains the case, the BBC must be seen to be impartial on this subject and indeed on any contentious political issue, especially because it is in receipt of licence fee income from all sections of the community, including those whooppose the introduction of such legislation.“Secondly, I find it very disappointing that the senior management of BBC NI has failed to face up to journalists’ questions on its stance, again because it should be seen to be responsive to all sections of the community it seeks to serve.“In my time in BBC management I was proud to debate openly with critics a number of controversial editorial decisions I was involved in, from the commissioning of ‘The Show from the Joker Club’ in the late s to a night of ‘gay-themed’ programming on BBC in the early s.”Mr Kennedy added that it is a privilege to enjoy income from licence fee payers but it brings a huge responsibility as the BBC must be seen to be held accountable.“Bland written statements simply will not do, especially when sections of the viewing public clearly wish to challenge one of your decisions,” he continued.“I firmly believe that the BBC is the best broadcasting organisation in the world and it should be particularly proud of its work over many decades in the challenging circumstances of Northern Ireland.“But on this occasion I believe it has made a mistake in allowing its staff to participate in the Pride festival as BBC representatives.”A BBC spokesperson defended its decision, saying: “BBC Pride is a staff-led initiative that seeks to reflect and support all aspects of workforce ersity.“None of this affects our decision-making about BBC output.“We are committed to serving all audiences and do this within the context of our editorial guidelines.”"},{"url":null,"title":"full of life and fun tributes paid to northern ireland chef who conquered kilimanjaro","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

since becoming Prime Minister has been branded “discourteous and offensive” by Sinn Fein..pushIn recent times incoming UK prime ministers have placed a call with their Irish counterpart on the first day of assuming office.Five days after his appointment as Prime Minister, Mr Johnson had not had a conversation with Leo Varadkar.It comes amid heightened tensions between the UK and Irish governments over the Brexit stand-off.Government officials in London and Dublin have been in contact amid efforts to arrange a conversation between the leaders.Arriving at Galway Races, Mr Varadkar said there were no plans for talks with Mr Johnson on Monday.A spokesman for the Taoiseach later said he hoped the men would speak in the “near future”.Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill accused Mr Johnson of “snubbing” Mr Varadkar.It is concerning that British PM Boris Johnson has failed to make contact with Irish Gov since coming into office.This lack of communication is highly offensive given the disastrous impact that Brexit will have for Ireland.We raised this issue with British SOS Julian Smith. pic yQCZjhNveH— Michelle O’NeillJuly , She raised the matter during a meeting with Northern Ireland’s new secretary of state Julian Smith at Stormont on Monday.“I would judge that it is highly discourteous that the new Prime Minister Boris Johnson is not engaging with the Taoiseach,” she said.“That is highly offensive given the disastrous impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland.”Mrs O’Neill said Mr Smith did not offer an explanation as to why there had been no contact between the prime ministers.She said it was not up to her who made the first move in initiating a conversation.“Whoever phones who first, the issue that needs to be discussed are the implications, the catastrophic implications for the island of Ireland so I think whenever the Taoiseach and Boris Johnson speak at some stage I think the message will be very, very clear from An Taoiseach – which will be around Brexit, the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement, it will be around the fact the withdrawal agreement needs to be adhered to and agreed because this is what the British government negotiated themselves a short time ago,” she said.Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I dont know is the answerMichelle ONeill on Boris JohnsonMrs O’Neill added: “British-Irish relations are very important, that does strike right to the heart of the Good Friday Agreement, but the jeopardy that the British government want to bring to our people on this island cannot be understated – it is huge, it’s going to impact for generations to come.”Mrs O’Neill said the rhetoric from Downing Street and the “right-wing cabinet” did not suggest there was going to be a Brexit deal achieved by the October deadline.She said she did not know Mr Johnson’s motivation in threatening to leave the EU without an agreement.“Is he electioneering, is he bluffing, is he trying to strengthen his hand in a negotiation  I don’t know is the answer,” she said.“What I am fixated on, what I am concerned about is what it means for the people here.”The Sinn Fein Assembly member added: “The language we have heard from Downing Street and the cabinet team over the course of the weekend has been very frightening for people on the ground.”Mrs O’Neill rejected the suggestion the Government might move to legislate to introduce direct rule in Northern Ireland ahead of the October  Brexit deadline,devolution has not be restored by then.“Direct rule is not acceptable, we cannot go backwards, we can only go forwards,” she said.The republican leader said she told Mr Smith he could not be a “bystander” in negotiations to restore powersharing, insisting “rights-based issues” at the heart of the impasse, such as Irish language protections, remained unresolved.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  DUP MP Gavin Robinson with party

and I have no doubt the Prime Minister and Taoiseach will discuss as well.”Askedhe viewed it as a snub, Mr Robinson said: “I think we have a new administration. You can see the Prime Minister is travelling right across the United Kingdom, visiting Scotland today, going to be in Northern Ireland this week announcing investment for every part of the United Kingdom.

It paid more than £.m between April and June this year alone.The Northern Trust was closely followed by the Southern Trust which paid more than £m between   and June this year.The Belfast Trust shelled out almost £m to SNG over the same period, while the Western Trust paid almost £m between   and June this year.The South Eastern Trust had the smallest bill — standing at just under £m for agency nurses from SNG between   and June this year.The figures have come to light just weeks after it emerged that one in six people in Northern Ireland is waiting longer than one year for a first outpatient appointment.Staff shortages and budget cuts are largely to blame for Northern Ireland’s spiralling waiting list shame.At the same time, the Royal College of Nursingin Northern Ireland is campaigning for better pay and conditions for its members in Northern Ireland as an increasing number of nurses are leaving the profession due to burn-out.There are currently around , vacant registered nursing posts in the health service, and a similar level in nursing homes, meaning health bosses are being forced to turn to agencies to keep services running.Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party’s health spokeswoman, said: “I have been working closely with the RCN over recent months in lobbying the Department of Health to address the sustainability of the nursing workforce and the high levels of pressure and responsibility placed upon them. data-dfpadtargetingThe Alliance Party’s Paula Bradshaw“Therefore, it is understandable why many qualied nurses opt to work for nursing agencies or, increasingly, work in a full-time job for a health trust, plus register with a nursing agency for bank shts, to supplement their income.“There are a number of issues that need to be addressed — firstly, this immediate one of installing a legislative framework in Northern Ireland that ensures that agencies operate within a controlled environment.“Secondly, we need to stabilise the nursing workforce here by ensuring that their pay and conditions are comparable to agency staff, so that vacancies become less frequent due to stress and unsafe working practices.”RCNdirector Pat Cullen said: “The RCN has continuously highlighted how excessive expenditure on agency nurses is a symptom of the nurse staffing crisis here in Northern Ireland. Addressing this issue is a major priority for our safe and effective care campaign.”The SNG declined to comment. A spokesman from the Department of Health said no cap exists in Northern Ireland to restrict the amount of money medical staffing agencies can charge the health service.When he announced his plans to introduce a cap on agency charges in October , Mr Hunt said: “For too long staffing agencies have been able to rip off the NHS by charging extortionate hourly rates which cost billions of pounds a year and undermine staff working hard to deliver high-quality care.“The tough new controls on spending that we’re putting in place will help the NHS improve continuity of care for patients and invest in the frontline, while putting an end to the days of unscrupulous companies charging up to £, a sht for a doctor.”"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Those included Foyle Jobs and Benefits Office on Asylum Road, Carlisle House on Carlisle Road and Orchard House on Foyle Street from early morning until .am.After the picket lines, members gathered for a rally at the City Hotel which began at .am.The -hour strike was organised to highlight an imposed “pay deal” of .% and changes to terms and conditions of employment which union officials claim have been implemented without proper and meaningful consultation.Ms Gates addressed the rally along with Gerry Murphy, President of Irish Congress of Trade Unionsand Niall McCarroll, Chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council .Mr McCarroll addressed a packed room at the City Hotel where he said all workers had taken action to bring about better working conditions.He said the Tory government was “attacking working class communities” and it is time to “fight back” by building solidarity amongst workers. “Let us together build up a working-class spirit and let the Tories know we can bring them down.”Meanwhile, Ms Gates was keen to dispel the notion of civil servants having well-paid “cushy jobs” as an “absolute myth”. She added: “There are civil servants relying on tax credits, second jobs, credit cards to bring them to the end of the month or to pay off debts and those using food banks.”She praised those in the room for leading the way, recognising that many,not all of them, could ill afford to go without pay for the day. “We have to say, enough is enough, they can’t keep piling work on us and saying they can’t even give us a decent pay increase.“Many workers are % worse off than ten years ago in real terms.”Referring to legal action which has been initiated for “failure to consult”, she informed those in attendance, that the judge has decided to forego a pre-hearing by instead fixing a court date.She added that there will be a “few white faces” in the Department of Finance who know their actions have been “discriminatory” as they have been “acting outside the law”. And concluded by saying “it’s time to strike a blow for all workers”.Other members of the audience were afforded an opportunity to speak and one worker, named Amy, said the government does not care about workers standards of living, nor their mental and physical health. She demanded a living wage for all.A motion was put forward by People Before Profit at last month’s full Council meeting calling on the Permanent Secretary at the Department of Finance to provide a “fair and just settlement” which was backed by all councillors. PBP Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced his support for all “necessary action”.NIPSA representative Ruaidhri O’Sandair had one final message for the department of Finance, “Sue Gray, where’s our pay ”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"derrys new holiday inn express officially opens doors","story":"Derry’s newest hotel officially opened its doors for business yesterday and in the process brought with it over  jobs.The Holiday Inn Express on the city’s Strand Road represents a £ million investment in the city and the chain’s owners, Intercontinental Hotels Group , have said its presence will not just enhance employment but will create business opportunities for service providers across the region as well as in Derry city centre.With  bedroom’s the new hotel is now the second largest in the city and as well as having all the state-of-the-art facilities associated with modern hotels its central location is within walking distance of all the city’s main tourist attractions, bars and restaurants.General Manager Stephen Redden said that he is confident the new hotel will add to the vibrancy of the Strand Road and act as a compliment to existing and emerging businesses.“We are delighted to open the doors and add a fresh dimension to the city’s accommodation.

This fits in with IHG’s introduction of Next Generation-a innovation geared to meet the needs of today’s ‘express’ traveller.Amongst the first guests at the Holiday Inn Express have been teams competing in this week’s Foyle Cup including Glenavon, Barnsley FC and Beann Mhadaghain FC from Belfast.The opening of the hotel was welcomed by President of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Brian McGrath who said: “This is excellent news for the city. Our tourism offer in the region is steadily growing and this new £m investment by Holiday Inn adds another great hotel to our growing list and provides more choice for visitors.“The creation of  new jobs in the process is a great boost for the city, not to mention the wider benefits that will be felt in the local supply chain.”"},{"url":null,"title":"derry university group ready support development north west institution","story":"The Derry University Group has said it is willing to “advise and support” the local council in establishing an independent university in the city.A meeting was held between Council Chief Executive John Kelpie, Deputy Mayor Cara Hunter, and the new Secretary of State for NI this week where the ongoing campaign for a Medical school at Magee was discussed.The Derry University Groupfelt it was a prime opportunity to impress upon SoS Julian Smith the need for an independent university in the city.This month, Derry City  Strabane District Councillors unanimously backed a motion supporting the exploration of all options for university provision in the North West. That included the expansion of Magee and the possibility of an independent university put forward by the DUG.The move followed an intervention by Labour Peer Lord Adonis who convinced the House of Lords to publish a report on the improvement of higher education provision in Northern Ireland and the establishment of a university whose principal campus is in Derry.A spokesperson for the Derry University Group said it is clear that the momentum for a dedicated university for the North West is growing all the time.“In recent months, Derry Strabane Council and other major influencers in Westminster and Dublin have committed themselves to delivering an independent university for the North West.“There has also been huge support from US colleges, who want to partner with a standalone university in Derry. It is completely apparent that the public here want action from the governments on a new university, now, as a matter of urgent priority.”“The North West, despite the political uncertainty, is in a prime position to establish a new cultural and educational institution, which could act as a catalyst for the economic regeneration of the region and reverse the damage already being done by Brexit on the Derry and Donegal communities.“The Derry University Group is willing to advise and assist Council and others in developing and delivering a new university, as we have always done in the past. Of course we also need a Medical School for the North West as part of any new university, but it is only a very small part of a much bigger picture.“We need a minimum of , additional students in this city.

No details were provided on how existing vegetation will be retained and no bioersity checklist was provided.”The residents also employed planning consultant Lee Kennedy, who told the Council of his concerns that some demolition work to existing buildings on the proposed development site had already taken place, prior to planning approval and that trees had been felled along the rear boundary of the site close to the homes of the objectors.A spokesperson for the Waterfoot residents said: “Mr Kennedy went onto state that residents have expressed genuine fears about a threat to the remaining vegetation on the application site.“He reminded Council that they hold a duty of care to work in the public interest and offer protection to the remaining mature trees, by the serving of a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderunder the  Planning Act.”Mr Kennedy confirmed to the Derry News that he had submitted a request for a TPO from the Council, but “no action had been taken.”However, the Waterfoot Park residents say their fears were heightened again earlier this month when a team of workers appeared on the proposed development site and began to cut down more trees.A spokesperson for the residents told the Derry News: “On Friday, July  at .am the neighbours were woken with the sound of several power saws and saw a full team of tree cutters on site behind them.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“Within an hour they had created absolute mayhem on the site, with trees felled all around and they were left when they fell. The ground and houses nearby vibrated and caused house alarms to go off.“Some neighbours felt very intimidated, shocked and panicked with the suddenness, noise level and by the time of the morning it happened. The residents are up in arms. It should never have been allowed to happen as Council was made aware last year about their responsibility of a duty of care to work in the public interest. The residents feel unsupported to date in their endeavours to the Council.”Addressing the residents’ concerns, a spokesperson for Derry City and Strabane District Council said that: “During the processing of the application,  objections have been received to the proposed development.“Correspondence to the Planning Department from Planning Consultant, Mr Lee Kennedy acting on behalf of the objectors, was received on August ,  and raised concerns regarding the trees on the site, and a request for a Provisional Tree Preservation Orderto be served on the site.“These concerns were raised with the Planning Department’s Tree Preservation Officer on September ,  who advised on September , that in his professional opinion, a TPO was not appropriate for this site given the nature, type and scale of trees.”On April  this year, Planning Department officials met with objectors at the city’s Council offices, where again, the Tree Preservation Officer advised that a TPO was considered but was unnecessary when assessed against the criteria required for a TPO.The Council spokesperson continued: “The site was further inspected by planning officers on June ,  and officers met with objectors on site.“More recently, the case officer wrote to the agent and the applicant on June ,  to advise that further information was required. Amongst other things requested, the case officer advised that a tree survey of the site was required, a landscaping plan to show existing trees and vegetation to be retained and additional planting to be shown and a bioersity checklist was to be submitted to advise on any existing ecology on the site.“The agent confirmed in correspondence dated, July  that a Phase  habitat survey was instructed to be carried out as well as a tree survey and would be submitted in due course.”However, the Council spokesperson added: “The Planning Department were made aware by an objector by email on July ,  that eight trees along the boundary of the site adjacent to properties in Waterfoot Park had been felled on July  at .am.“Council takes its obligations in respect of these matters seriously and has undertaken an appropriate course of action to ensure that the opinions of residents are and will be fully considered in the processing of the planning application.”CAPTION: Residents of Waterfoot Park have accused the Council of failing to provide a duty of care in relation to a proposed building development."},{"url":null,"title":"picture special royal welsh show powys county times camera club stars","story":"A magnicent beast at the Royal RWelsh Show from Mick Pleszkan.\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsFrom the equine classes at the Royal Welsh Showby Mick Pleszkan\" Picture special from the Royal Welsh Show by Powys County Times Camera Club starsAgony of choice...

Following myfrom maternity leave, I availed of a temporary reduction in hours, working three days per week instead of five.ldquoSo when a colleague was appointed Temporary Head of English, and I was not considered because I was working part-time, I thought it was unfair to be denied the opportunity to be considered for this temporary promotion and the chance to gain that experience. I understand that the demands of the post would mean working full time, but I wasnrsquot given this option.However, the settlement has not detracted from Ms McCormickrsquos enjoyment of working as a teacher as Assumption Grammar School.She added: ldquoI love my job and am happy at the school, so Irsquom pleased that a new co-option policy has been put in place which will ensure that opportunities for career enhancement are dealt with on a formal and procedurally correct manner.In settling the case, Assumption Grammar School said it recognised that it did not give Ms McCormick an opportunity to apply or be considered for the position and disadvantaged her as a part time flexible worker.The schoolrsquos board of governors said it regretted the upset felt by Ms McCormick and looked forward to a continued good working relationship with her.The board of governors confirmed that there will be ldquono disadvantage to her due to the fact that she was unable to avail of the acting up experience, nor will she be victimised in any way.They added that the school would liaise with the Equality Commission on appropriate training in recruitment and selection with specic focus on part-time workers.Anne McKernan, Head of Legal Services at the Equality Commission, said: ldquoThis is a good result all round.ldquoOne of the main reasons we support cases is to effect change. While Catherine missed out on this opportunity, she has been able to secure a change in policy and practice that will benefit other teachers into the future.ldquoItrsquos good that this has been resolved productively and amicably. Wersquore publicising this to remind all employers of the dficulties and dangers of disadvantaging people on flexible or part time working arrangements, even unintentionally.Ms McKernan went on to explain that in Northern Ireland % of female employees worked part-time compared to % of male employees and % of part-time employees were women.She added: ldquoBecause of the high concentration of women in part-time jobs, any measure which excludes part-timers from a particular post or promotion is likely to have a more adverse effect on women and thatrsquos why it may amount to indirect sex discrimination..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch’s French connection  ","story":"ON Saturday the Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Twinning Group will stage a charity fundraising garden party at the home of Hugh and Violet Hawthorne, opposite the Dairy Lake on the old Belfast Road, Ballynahinch.Special guests will include seven visitors from Lamorlaye in northern France, and interestingly, the Lamorlaye Ballynahinch partnership celebrates its st anniversary this year, dating back to .Connections between Ballynahinch and France are not new some actually existed in the heady days of the Seven Years War and the French Revolution. In , as part of an ongoing world war between France and Great Britain, a substantial French force led by Commodore Franccedilois Thurot invaded Co Antrim, and captured Carrickfergus Castle. The French sustained  dead and  wounded.Two of the wounded French officers, Brigadier Flobert and Major Brajelon, were treated with extraordinary kindness while in Ulster. They convalesced in comfort at Moira Castle in Co Down, before being repatriated to France.It is thought that part of their welcome was owing to their membership of the Freemasons ndash Lord Moira being a Mason himself. Around  mdash at the same time he was entertaining the French mdash Moira planned to move his family headquarters to Ballynahinch, and was busy building his new Montalto House there.Thirty years later Lord Moirarsquos son Francis ndash by now a resident at Montalto mdash was rather less friendly towards the French. In December , as a British Major-General, he led a military expedition to the Royalist deacutepartement of La Vendeacutee, with the intention of reversing the French Revolution. In June , he was back on the Continent, in a successful operation against the French in the Low Countries.With the  rebellion now looming, Franciswas warned his own home town was a hotbed of sedition. Nonsense, he famously declared in the Irish House of Lords: ldquoNo town is so loyal as Ballynahinch!. He was wrong there. In fact the military committee of the United Irishmen, meeting in Armstrongrsquos Inn on Ballynahinch Square, was busy plotting a French invasion of Ireland.The rebel planners communicated with French generals via their Co Down emissaries, Alexander Lowry and Bartholomew Teeling.Lowry hailed from Linen Hill in Katesbridge mdash his house is still there mdash and Teeling was from Twinbrook. They were now resident on the continent along with their close associate Wolfe Tone. British military intelligence knew all of these details perfectly well, and Armstrongrsquos Inn was one of the first buildings to be burned down after the Battle of Ballynahinch.On August , , General Jean-Joseph Humbert landed a small French expedition in Killala, Co Mayo, on the west coast of Ireland. This was in direct retaliation for Lord Moirarsquos earlier intervention in La Vendeacutee. Humbertrsquos force was too small and too late, and achieved little. The rising in Ulster had been extinguished two months earlier.As late as Emmetrsquos Rebellion in  there were rebel hopes mdash always disappointed mdashthat a French army would arrive in Co Down.The poem, The Man From God Knows Where, reads:lsquoFor a wheen orsquo days we sat waitinrsquo the word to rise and go at it like men, but no French ships sailed into Cloughey Bay and we heard the black news on a harvest day that the cause was lost again.rsquoHorace Reid will give a -minute slide presentation of these tales on Saturday afternoon.

To me, this is a critical part of the continued regeneration of Irish Street.ldquoThe brief aims to encourage developers to come forward to redevelop the area and I wholeheartedly welcome plans to work alongside the local community on the design of the site to maximise not only the Irish Street sitersquos potential, but its historical heritage.Cllr Hanlon said revitalisation schemes in other towns have proved successful and welcomed assurances from the Department of Communities and local council that they will work closely with businesses and provide support to ensure the revitalisation scheme is delivered efficiently and quickly.ldquoThe delays in completion of the public realm scheme have undoubtedly impacted trade on Irish Street and the wider Downpatrick town centre, she said. ldquoConfirmation that revitalisation funding is being made available is a welcome boost.ldquoIt is imperative that businesses feedback to the steering group what they feel will work best from the revitalisation scheme to help them going forward. While the scheme is limited to Irish Street traders, it will no doubt have a positive impact on the wider town centre economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan is ready for week of Ulster Fleadh fun  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN is set to welcome over , musicians and guests for the  Ulster Fleadh this week.The traditional Irish music festival and follows hot on the heels of Castlewellanrsquos annual agricultural show, which saw , people descend upon the Mourne town.The week long festival of competitions, concerts and ceili dances runs until Sunday and celebrates all thatrsquos good in Irish music, song and dance.Some of the names on the bill include Zoe Conway, Donal Lunny and Martin OrsquoConnor.There will also be theof the Ulster Fleadh parade followed by a firework display and open-air music all weekend with lots of free entertainment.Organisers say the event, worth pound. million to the town last year, marks the fourth consecutive year for Co Down to host the event, following Bangorrsquos back-to-back stints in  and .Last year more than , competitors from across Ulster took part with more expected this year.Newry, Mourne and Down District Council says it is delighted to support the Ulster Fleadh.ldquoThe council believe that as a result of footfall generated through events like this, visitors are more likely toto the area for sightseeing, embracing our offer of food and drink or attending other events, a spokesman said.ldquoThere is a clear economic benefit generated for the district both on the weekend of the event and following it with further repeat visits.Paddy Breen, Fleadh chairman, said: ldquoWe are hoping to go bigger and better this year as it is the th anniversary of our host branch, Newcastle Cohhaltas Ceoltoiri Eireann .Last year we welcomed nearly , visitors to the town over the course of the weekrsquos events.ldquoVisitors to the Ulster Fleadh come from all over Ireland and we attract a iety of visitors of all ages -

The same stage also saw second-placed Meirion Evans lose six minutes with a puncture.Luckily for Armstrong, his time loss wasnrsquot as severe but it was still painful nonetheless as he ped one minute, placing him at the bottom of the top .The incident only made the Fermanagh man more determined and by the time crews arrived back at service after stage eight, he had set four fastest stage times and clambered his way back up to second overall.While early rally leaders, Jonny Greer and Kirsty Riddick, were forced to retire with mechanical problems, Armstrong had recovered to second position, just six seconds adrt of new leaders Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan, with Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell third.The chasing crew got the bit between their teeth for the final loop of three stages which saw Armstrong move into the rally lead for the first time after stage nine.Using the power of his Mini WRC to full effect, he consolidated his advantage over the final two tests to win the event by just over  seconds.ldquoWe didnrsquot expect to win at all, Armstrong said at the finish. ldquoItrsquos only my second rally in two years so the aim was to get a bit of seat time in a World Rally car.ldquoItrsquos something that Irsquove never really had a lot of but I try to make up for it by making detailed pace notes which is what stood by us today.ldquoNoel and I worked really well together and the car worked really well too, he added.Stephen Wright and Liam Moynihan had to settle for second overall but in doing so, they claimed maximum McGrady Insurance N.I. Championship points.Wright had led the series after winning the opening round, but he subsequently missed an event, so the result puts him back on target for a  title challenge.In third position, Daniel Harper and Chris Campbell were the best of the Protyre Motorsport UK Asphalt Championship crews.Their Mini WRC never missed a beat as they powered to another podium position, finishing with a reasonable cushion over the rest of the chasing pack.The battle for fourth overall raged right through to the finish with four crews in with a shout of the award. In the end, Melvyn Evans and Aled Davies secured the position from Derek McGarrity and Paddy Robinson, with Steve Wood and Keith Moriarty sixth.Stuart Biggerstaff and Anthony Nestor had also been right in the hunt, but they dropped out of contention with power-steering troubles on stage nine.As for McGarrity, the result gives his NI Championship campaign a welcome boost as he continues to play catch-up after his round one retirement.He was left a little bit disappointed that a wrong tyre choice and a broken anti-roll bar thwarted a potential challenge for outright victory but he is very much among the main contenders for the  championship spoils.The bottom half of the top  also featured the father and son team of Draperstownrsquos Derek and Mark McGeehan.It was navigator Markrsquos second closed road rally, and only his second time reading pace notes, so his father Derek was as proud as punch of his efforts at the finish.Last yearrsquos winner Jonny Greer was left despondent after his retirement.He blitzed the opposition on the opening stage when he went  seconds faster than anyone  and when both Meirion Evans and Jon Armstrong hit trouble on stage four, it looked as though the Carryduff based driver was on course for another win.However, it wasnrsquot to be as one stage later, suspected gearbox troubles forced him and navigator Kirsty Riddick out of the rally.WDIn the battle for two-wheel-drive honours, Damian Toner and Barry McParland put in a scintillating display aboard their Ford Escort MkII.They were never outside the top  and eventually powered home to a seventh-placed finish with a comfortable margin over their two-wheel-drive rivals. Even burning his hand while working on his car failed to dampen Tonerrsquos day.Camillus Bradley and Crawford Henderson claimed second in the category after early second-placed holder Wesley Patterson went out with a broken crown wheel and pinion.Round five of the McGrady Insurance Motorsport UK Northern Ireland Rally Championship will see a switch from tarmac to gravel as crews head to Co Fermanagh in September for the Lakeland Stages Rally.The series is beginning to heat up and a three-way fight for the crown is developing between Derek McGeehan, Derek McGarrity and Stephen Wright.

A minute later, Stuart Martin, who had been heavily watched all afternoon, flashed over a super score and followed it up with another.Not to be outdone Derry star Mullan found the space to register his fourth point of the evening.The introduction of Ciaran Watson, Michael McKey and Padraig Doran saw a fresh approach as the visitors started to claw their way back into this thrilling encounter.In the th minute Conor McCrickard plundered a second goal for his side and when Stuart Martin pointed two minutes later, Down were just a score away from levelling the contest.Richie Mullan gave the home side a four-point advantage with a brilliantly angled free out near the sideline.The outcome of the game turned when McAlornan blocked Mullan shot for goal.Derry only managed to score two more points in the remaining five minutes as an inspired Down side levelled the contest for the first time with a m Costello point.With referee Aidan Ferguson indicating there was to be four minutes of extra time, it was game on. Eoghan Cassidy edged the home side in front with a super effort from out on the left wing, only to see McCrickard level once more from a similar type angled dead ball score.Derry had spurned an opportunity of snatching the game when the Down rearguard pressurised Seaacuten Kelly into shooting wide.Fom the resulting puck-out a tussle for possession saw Niall Fitzsimmons flash the sliotar over the Derry crossbar.When the whistle finally blew five minutes over the , it was Down who had progressed to Semple Stadium.Down: C McAlornan, E Kelly, T Murray, A Dorrian, C Smith, R McCrickard, N McFarlane , N Fitzsimmons , P Savage, J Hanrahan, R Blair , T Prenter , R Costello , C McCrickard , S Martin .

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely.

The pension applies to both Vale and Cardf council workers.Friends of the Earth Cymru congratulated the council.Spokeswoman Bleddyn Lake said: ldquoAfter years of lobbying by Friends of the Earth, itrsquos fantastic to see Cardf councillors taking the historic decision to stop supporting the fossil fuel companies that are fuelling the climate crisis.ldquoNow itrsquos time for all the local authority pension funds in Wales to follow Cardfrsquos lead.ldquoToo many have been hiding away from taking meaningful action, but a climate emergency means we cannot afford to be investing money in the very companies driving climate change.ldquoResearch has shown esting from fossil fuel companies is better financially and will minimise future financial risks for those with pensions in these funds.ldquoClimate change is the challenge of our age. We canrsquot afford to push action further down the road all the time or expect others to be the ones to sort out this mess.ldquoWe want to see the Wales Pension Partnership, the Welsh Assembly, the Welsh Government and all other public body pension funds ditch fossil fuel investments and we will be keeping the pressure up until they do the right thing, both for the planet and for future generations here in Wales and around the world.Previous research by Friends of the Earth found that the eight local authority pension funds in Wales invested over poundbn between them in fossil fuel companies.Last year Monmouthshire Council was the first in Wales to vote to est its pension fund from fossil fuel companies. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

One was in relation to a report of a loud bang in the Tullygally Road area of Craigavon. About  minutes later there was another report from a Belfast-based newspaper that they had received a report that a device had been fired at a police patrol but it missed its target. We responded and discovered a suspicious object at a bus shelter close to Aldervale flats.“We put up cordons, which caused a bit of disruption to local residents, on the advice of Army Technical Officers. They advised us that the flats had to be evacuated.Device was found close to a bus shelter in the Tullygally area of Craigavon“There were a number of people who were reluctant to leave but we engaged with them and persuaded people to go to alternative accommodation. Quite a few had family members that they could go to in the area. Also the Parochial House was opened up and people were able to go there,” said Supt Middleton.“I want to stress my thanks to everyone who did engage with us and support us in very dficult circumstances and also for the very public outpouring of support we have had since then from both members of the community and elected representatives. It meant a lot to me at the time and to my officers.“Our colleagues in ATO made the device safe. It was a viable device. It was a dangerous device that had been left at the bus shelter. “It was a mortar-type device which had not been fired at a passing police patrol. We were able to clary that very quickly. It was attached to a concrete block and that concrete block had been manufactured - and within that concrete block was a device containing explosives. This was designed to kill.“Our working hypothesis and that of the investigations team was that the initial bang was to draw us into the area and then with the secondary device and anybody who would be handling the suspicious object - it was designed to kill.“We have already got feedback in relation to that. The ATO, when they made the device safe, they were able to report to me that it was viable and it was designed to kill.“We believe the device was an attempt by dissident republican terrorists to murder police officers. I condemn this strongly.” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"PORT | Article Teaser\"She said there have been no arrests as yet and the investigations is at an early stage.“No group has claimed responsibility and the investigation team have an open mind as to which grouping it might be.“My assessment is the threat that we are facing is coming from within local communities and I want to offer reassurances as well that this will not deter us in any shape or form.“As the local commander my responsibility is for making sure we deliver high quality and effective policing service. I can assure the local communities of this district, that is what our focus will be.“This won’t put us off and we will continue to build on the strong relationships that we already have in the local community.“This was a completely reckless attack. This was a busy residential area. This is a busy road and right beside a bus stop and a block of flats. When the ATO advised me that the flats needed to be evacuated that gives you some insight into the size and the damage that could have been caused.“I would like to appeal for information. This really saddens me what has happened on Friday night. We are no dferent from any other emergency service. We are just trying to provide a service to the local community and be there when the community need us most.“What I do know is the explosives need to have been sourced somewhere. The bomb had to be constructed. You will see from the photographs, this was a sophisticated construction. It wasn’t crude. It had to be transported. It had to be put in place where it would have maximum impact and then the people that did it had to leave the area.“My appeal is for anybody who, in the weeks and days leading up to Friday night, saw anything suspicious in terms of vehicles or people.“I can assure any of your readers that I am not interested in who they are. All I am interested in is what they know.“We have a report as well from a witness that saw a young male running away onto rough ground from the bus shelter area. That was about quarter to twelve on Friday night which would have been in and around the time that is relevant to us and went onto the black paths.“He is described as being ’” to ’”, slight to medium build and on that basis the witness felt they were young, in their late teens to early s, wearing a light grey or beige long sleeve hooded top with the hood up and face covered. We are particularly interested in speaking to that person.”When asked what direction the witness saw the male running, Superintendent Middleton said they did not know but it would be helpful to find out in which direction he ran.Askedshe was concerned about an escalation of dissident activity, she said: “Obviously it is of concern that we have had a viable bomb left in a public road in Craigavon which I believe was intended for my officers. So that is of concern to me and that is increasing activity, obvious increasing activity. But the reality is the threat to serving officers in Northern Ireland is severe and has been for the last ten years, and certainly within this area, I have seen a consistent threat rather than anything that would have happened in peaks and troughs. We are aware of it. It is something that is a priority to the PSNI - is the threat of violent extremism and therefore it is something we take into account and consideration in our policing response.”When askedthis would mean even more caution in a police emergency response, she said: “No I don’t think so. This is what we are used to unfortunately. It is very sad that I have to say that but it is what our policing environment looks like here in Northern Ireland.“I think, even in terms of our response on Saturday morning in the early hours, it shows how alive we are to the possibilities with such devices. While it saddens me, it doesn’t surprise me.”try catch  TrendingPSNI probe after man dies suddenlyMumrsquos heartbreak after dog dies following lake swimScott Brown to be laid to restSafety concerns at state of land amid lsquoblame gamersquo over ownershipArrest after pound, of suspected heroin found in Co Armagh*,:after,:before .teaser-essential,.u-clearfix .teaser-essential:after,.teaser-essential:before,.u-clearfix:after,.u-clearfix:before .teaser-essential:after,.u-clearfix:after .teaser-essential__link-primary .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad img -moz-transform: rotate-ms-transform: rotate-o-transform: rotatetransform: rotatedisplay: blockwidth: %height: %overflow: hiddenobject-fit: coverobject-position: center@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal@font-face src: url format, url format, url formatfont-weight: font-style: normal.slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix__title span .teaser-matrix__readers, .slab-matrix__tabs li .teaser-matrix__heading, .teaser-matrix__category-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link, .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .slab--wowbrand  .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner  .slab__block @media .slab__inner @media .slab__inner .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title @media@media@media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title:hover,.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type:hover .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:first-child .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type @media .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title span:nth-of-type .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title .logo .slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a,.inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile a .inews-link-mobile @media@media.slab--wowbrand .slab-essential__title a:after,.inews-link-mobile a:after .slab-matrix .slab-matrix .slab__block @media@media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child @media.slab-matrix .slab__block:nth-child, .slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix__tabs .slab-matrix__tabs li .slab-matrix__tabs li.is-current .slab-matrix__title @media.slab-matrix__title span .slab-matrix.tabbed, .tabbed.slab-related .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block .slab-matrix__title, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block .slab-matrix__title .slab-matrix.tabbed .slab__block:nth-child, .tabbed.slab-related .slab__block:nth-child .slab-matrix-link .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad @media@media@media@media.teaser-matrix:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix:hover img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover img .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__image-container:before .teaser-matrix__image-container  img .teaser-matrix__image, .teaser-matrix img, .teaser-matrix--native-ad imgcontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix__text-container .teaser-matrix__heading .teaser-matrix__heading:hover .teaser-matrix__meta-container @media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative .teaser-matrix__category-link--relative.popular .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__readers:after .teaser-matrix__readers svg .teaser-matrix__readers svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.up svg fill: #CFC.teaser-matrix__readers.up svg path .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg .teaser-matrix__readers.down svg path animation: half-fade s ease-out infinite.teaser-matrix__readers  span @media span @media span .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text .teaser-matrix__link-primary .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-containercontrastfilter: saturate contrast-moz-filter: saturate contrastopacity: .teaser-matrix.is-ie-fit:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container, .is-ie-fit.teaser-matrix--native-ad:hover  .teaser-matrix__image-container .ie .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix--native-ad__meta-container .teaser-matrix, .teaser-matrix--native-ad .teaser-matrix__image-container .teaser-matrix__text-container background: -webkit-linear-gradient.teaser-matrix__heading @media@media@media.teaser-matrix__category-link .teaser-matrix__readers .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link .teaser-matrix__sponsor-link:hover .teaser-matrix__sponsor-text @media screen and .dy_unit .dy-editorial-wow__items + .dy_wow_widget_header .st .st The EssentialsVisit inewsVisit inews        v.. -

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/NI-Chamber-President.jpg","title":"ni politicians must not waste time amid restoration talks","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s politicians “must not waste time” amid ongoing talks at restoring an Executive while business here should employ the “collaborative vision” that saw industries grow following the Good Friday Agreement.  John Healy, president of the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said “we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are apparently talking” but after two years without movement of any kind “we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry”. “Nevertheless, they mustn’t waste time. So much is at stakethey don’t want history to look back on this period and say – they promised so much but delivered so little. \"My advice would be: Don’t give up. Don’t let a dficulty today ruin the vision for tomorrow. We in business and industry will give you all the encouragement you need.” He was speaking more than  guests at the NI Chamber Annual President’s Lunch at Belfast City Hall. Mr Healy, who heads up Allstate in Northern Ireland, also said thata fresh bid to host the World Chambers Congress is successful, it could be worth around £m to the Northern Ireland economy. “We need action on the economy, on infrastructure, on health – addressing the drastic shortage of clinical nurses, for example – or on education,” he said. “The drt of our talented students to universities across the water or how we face issues like numeracy and literacy levels. “However, we should be heartened by the fact that our politicians are now talking. That’s a welcome step forward. But after two years without movement of any kind, we shouldn’t expect results in a hurry.” Speaking about the Chamber’s attempt to host the World Chambers Congress, he said: “Less than two weeks ago, NI Chamber along with the British Chamber of Commerce and Chambers Ireland were in Rio at the World Chambers Congress, showcasing Northern Ireland as a potential host for the conference in . “Held every two years in a dferent region of the world, the World Chambers Congress provides unparalleled opportunities to connect and strengthen relations with a erse and international group of iniduals representing more than  countries. “The bid,successful, could bring an estimated economic value of £.m to Northern Ireland and we were joined in Rio by our strategic partners including Invest Northern Ireland, Belfast City Council, Visit Belfast and ICC Belfast.” Those attending the lunch also heard from Eddie O’Sullivan, former head coach to the Irish national rugby team, and gaelic football legend Pat Spillane.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%.
