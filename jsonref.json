British Muslims are BRITISH\u0027: Fury as Andrea Leadsom...Fury as London mayor Sadiq Khan rolls his eyes and says...Share this articleHe added: \u0027Labour Peers are also firm in their view that the failure to deal with what is now a crisis in the Labour Party is a political failure and not one of process or resourcing.\u0027Until the people making the decisions about discipline and expulsions accept as antisemitic words and actions viewed by the Jewish community as antisemitic nothing will change and the crisis will continue.\u0027 Peers demanded answers on whether Ms Formby had written the incendiary letter attacking Mr Watson or if it was drafted in Mr Corbyn\u0027s office.They also probed whether Corbyn aide Andrew Murray and his daughter Laura Murray were involved in Labour\u0027s complaints process.      the resignation of Jewish MP Luciana Berger was described as \u0027the worst day of shame in the Labour Party\u0027s 120-year history\u0027.In one of the darkest days in Labour\u0027s history yesterday, Britain\u0027s equalities watchdog admitted the party may have \u0027unlawfully discriminated\u0027 against Jews.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) will now consider whether to launch a formal probe. Labour would have to hand over email and other correspondence so investigators can see how the party dealt with discrimination claims.The EHRC could then compel Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s party to overhaul the way it deals with anti-Semitism cases, which would be enforceable by the courts.           Labour MP John Mann, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, predicted the EHRC\u0027s move would eventually lead to resignations of senior party figuresIt would only be the second time the watchdog has taken action against a political party. Nine years ago it forced the BNP to drop its \u0027whites only\u0027 membership rule.Labour said it will co-operate fully with the EHRC, but said it rejects \u0027completely\u0027 any suggestion it has acted unlawfully. Last night moderate Labour MPs predicted high-level resignations.The move comes two days after it emerged that Mr Corbyn\u0027s aide Laura Murray sought to block the suspension of a member who described an anti-Semitic mural of a group of \u0027hook-nosed\u0027 men as \u0027great\u0027.It was reported yesterday that another ally of the leader, Thomas Gardiner, had intervened repeatedly to downgrade suspensions for anti-Semitism.The EHRC – which was founded by the Blair government – said it acted after receiving two dossiers showing examples where anti-Semitism was not dealt with properly by Labour. One was from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, and the other was from the Jewish Labour Movement.On a shameful day for Labour, Mr Corbyn remained silent over the threat of an investigation.Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who has been subjected to anti-Semitic abuse, called it a \u0027devastating indictment\u0027. She added: \u0027Decent members will be horrified that we have got into this position. I welcome the EHRC intervention but today is another dark day in the history of our party which could and should have been avoided if concerns raised had been heeded last year.\u0027Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said he was \u0027deeply saddened\u0027 at the EHRC move.He said he would contact Labour general secretary Jennie Formby to ask for all relevant files and data to be retained \u0027so that investigators can form a clear picture of the processes and culture around Labour\u0027s response to anti-Semitism\u0027.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was \u0027utterly disgraceful and unacceptable\u0027 that the party had taken so long to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027We need to remove this stain from our party, and we need to expel these despicable iniduals, so we can go into the next election, united by our historic values, not poisoned by this vicious disease,\u0027 she said.The EHRC will now contact Labour to set out its concerns. If the response is found to be unsatisfactory, it could launch a formal investigation.A spokesman for the watchdog said: \u0027Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs.      \u0027Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond.\u0027A Labour spokesman said: \u0027We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC. Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations.\u0027Labour MP John Mann, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, predicted the EHRC\u0027s move would eventually lead to resignations of senior party figures.\u0027Obviously there will be resignations from those in power as this fully unfolds,\u0027 he said. \u0027Everyone should let the EHRC do its job.\u0027Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said: \u0027It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established. Since the Holocaust, Britain has led the world in promoting human rights, and it could scarcely be more important to British society that the Jew hatred festering in the Labour Party is firmly brought to an end.\u0027The Jewish Labour Movement said it asked the EHRC in November last year to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was \u0027institutionally anti-Semitic\u0027.

Brutal blast of wind and rain will...Share this articleIf Mr Ashley\u0027s plans are successful, he would step down from his position as chief executive of Sports Direct, though would retain his controlling 60 per cent stake.He would be replaced at the top of the company by deputy finance boss Chris Wootton in an acting capacity.  The company\u0027s stock jumped 40 per cent today after Mr Ashley called for a clean sweep at the top of Debenhams and proposed installing himself as a chief executive (stock image)It would cement his position as one of the most powerful players on the high street, having already acquired House of Fraser and Evans Cycles last year.Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said the move suggested an impending tie-up between House of Fraser and Debenhams.\u0027One wonders why Ashley does not simply go the obvious route and bid for Debenhams and combine into the House of Fraser rump,\u0027 he said.          Mr Ashley pictured at Wembley Stadium last month\u0027The rationale for tying these companies together is clearly compelling. If the coup fails, he will surely launch a takeover.\u0027If it succeeds he will be able to tie up the operational side and shore up finances from his own resources. Whether this boardroom coup fails or not, there is surely only one outcome from all of this: Mike Ashley will get what he wants.\u0027In January, Mr Ashley teamed up with fellow shareholder Landmark to eject Debenhams chairman Sir Ian Cheshire and chief executive Sergio Bucher from the board.The shock announcement comes just days after Debenhams issued its latest profit warning.It warned that trading headwinds, efforts to put the group on a secure financial footing and macroeconomic uncertainties are hitting the company hard.The profit alert was the fourth in just over a year.Meanwhile shares in Sports Direct slipped as much as 2.6 per cent on Friday.Laith Khalaf, analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \u0027Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley\u0027s unorthodox style.\u0027          Mr Ashley owns just under 30 per cent of Debenhams through Sports Direct, the retail firm\u0027s largest shareholder (stock image)"},{"url":null,"title":"R Kellys girlfriend calls parents explosive interview ends call suddenly","story":"Joycelyn Savage is shown, left, in her interview with Gayle King that will be aired on Friday.

How?!\u0027 he said, loosening his tie in frustration.           Kelly\u0027s oldest child, Joann, 20, said in January that he was a \u0027monster\u0027 who she\u0027d had no relationship with for yearsHe also said that while he \u0027loves\u0027 Andrea, she lied by claiming in the docu-series Surviving R. Kelly that he had been abusing her for years. \u0027She is not telling the truth. I love her to death, I have nothing against her still, that is my kids\u0027 mother. \u0027I am not disrespecting her by saying that she is not telling the truth, I\u0027m just being honest,\u0027 he said. Seconds later, he erupted into tears and spoke directly to the camera, saying: \u0027My kids are living this. This is real. This is not a lie! What kind of woman would tear down a dad who\u0027s trying to have a relationship with their kids?!\u0027 He said he had \u0027zero\u0027 relationship with his children but knows that they \u0027love him\u0027.   \u0027I know they love me and I am in love with my kids. I love my kids,\u0027 he said. He also reminisced nostalgically about proposing to his ex-wife with a \u0027helicopter\u0027 and wept about the claims that he had abused her with a hog-tie, saying: \u0027My kids are listening to this!\u0027  In January, after the docuseries was aired, R. Kelly\u0027s oldest daughter penned an emotional Instagram post where she put distance between them. \u0027The same monster you all confronting me about is my father. I am well aware of who and what he is. I grew up in that house.      Kelly\u0027s three children are shown when they were kids. Joann, left, is the oldest. He also has a transgender son, 19-year-old Jay (right) and a 17-year-old son, Robert Jr. (front)\u0027I just want you all to understand that devastated is an understatement for all that I feel currently,\u0027 she said in part. Kelly\u0027s interview with King is his first in years. It reveals his \u0027disturbing\u0027 mental state and desperation along with his take on his relationships with girlfriends Azriel Clary and Joycelyn Savage. Their parents say he has brainwashed them into not talking to their families. He made the astonishing claim in the first part of his CBS interview that the girls\u0027 families \u0027sold\u0027 them to him. King asked him: \u0027What kind of love is it that keeps these young women away from their families?\u0027 He gave the shocking answer: \u0027I\u0027m going answer your question -- what kind of father, what kind of mother would sell their daughter to a man?\u0027 Joycelyn Savage, 23, claimed her parents were lying about their concern for her Stunned, King asked: \u0027Who did that?\u0027\u0027How come it was okay for me to see them until they wasn\u0027t getting no money from me?\u0027 Kelly says.          Kelly is back behind bars in Chicago for failing to pay his child support \u0027Why would you take your daughter -- if I were going to take my daughter and she\u0027s 19 years old to a 49-year-old icon whatever, celebrity, R. Kelly concert, whoever it is, I\u0027m not going to  put her on the stage and leave her. \u0027I\u0027m going to take her to the concert.\u0027\u0027Their father is more into my music and knew about my music than they do,\u0027 he said. Kelly\u0027s legal troubles are split between two cases. The first is a criminal case in which he is accused of raping four women, three of whom were minors when they say he attacked them, between 1998 and 2010. He has pleaded not guilty on all counts and will return to court soon.The second case is the child support case which is ex-wife, Andrea, has is pursuing. That is what landed him in jail for a second time after he posted bail on the criminal rape charges. His new legal woes come after years of speculation and accusations about his sexual relationships with young girls.It came to a head earlier this year with the release of the Lifetime docu-series, Surviving R. Kelly, where seven women made allegations against him.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Professor sacked Royal Academy Music calling violinists gypos wins 180 000 payout","story":"    Pointing out what they might expect in the \u0027real world\u0027, Prof Francesca Carpos-Young said the orchestra might be referred to as \u0027the boys\u0027, the brass section were pub-goers and the string section were called \u0027pond life\u0027 and were tea drinkersThe man who put SEX into symphonies: To Brits, he was...Group of female Trump supporters called the Trumpettes host...Share this article\u0027Having been discriminated and victimised by the Royal Academy of Music, I am troubled by the welfare of the 58 students who signed the open letter to say that they had suffered discrimination.\u0027I sincerely hope that the Academy, places themselves under an external review, offering all staff and students a confidential platform to resolve the hidden issues of discrimination in the Academy.\u0027She added: \u0027The knock-on effect of the weak decision-making by the senior management has been reputational harm to the Academy, and ironically this is what they were hoping to avoid.\u0027It is a matter of great personal sadness that I have had to bring the Royal Academy of Music to court, simply to ensure that those within it are acting fairly, honestly and with due regard for the law.\u0027I hope this case will warn other employers off arbitrary dismissals.\u0027          Francesca Carpos-Young pictured with Welsh singing legend Sir Tom JonesAnd speaking about discrimination in the classical music world, she added: \u0027My PhD research describes the reality of musicians who struggle in their musical life through lack of work, poor working conditions, and low pay.\u0027Although it is well known that orchestras are white, middle-class and rife with chauvinism, racism, sexism, and elitism, and although orchestral life appears to be prejudicial, the lack of multiculturalism and ersity in orchestras just seems to continue.\u0027Real change can only happen with the support and engagement of the music conservatoires, and I sincerely hope that the Academy will consider joining us in working to create a safer and more inclusive future for the classical music industry.\u0027The professor\u0027s claims of whistle-blowing and sexual discrimination were dismissed -

Dame Kelly was responding to a tweet by Good Morning Britain in support of Martina Navratilova who had suggested that trans women who competed in women\u0027s sports were \u0027cheating\u0027 because of a biological advantage          Trans cyclist Rachel McKinnon calls out Holmes\u0027 sponsors Garmin and Specialized for supporting and suggests they drop her for not holding the same values          McKinnon, who also has academic pursuits, is one of a few transgender world champions across the sporting world. She achieved a 2018 UCI Masters Track Cycling gold medal at a competition in Los AngelesShe wrote on Twitter: ‘So hey Specialized and Garmin have you been following how your athlete Kelly Holmes has been extremely transphobic lately on Twitter?’ She added: ‘Specialized, you have a trans athlete. Garmin, you cool with this?’Miss McKinnon urged the companies to ‘take a stand’ as Dame Kelly was ‘trying to ban trans women from competing in women’s sport’ in breach of International Olympic Committee (IOC) policy.Miss McKinnon has argued that since IOC rules introduced in 2003 allowed trans women to compete, ‘not a single trans athlete has even qualified for the Olympics, let alone won a medal’.           Holmes responded to the criticism by saying she felt strongly about competitive sports, and wanted evidence there was no disadvantage before she would back downCycling specialists Specialized said it would investigate Dame Kelly’s comments, posting on Twitter: ‘Thanks for flagging this, Rachel. This is not representative of our brand values.’Dame Kelly, who won gold in the 800m and 1,500m running events in the 2004 Olympics, hit back – telling Miss McKinnon that involving her sponsors was ‘going about this in the wrong way’. In a tweet, she questioned why she had been blocked by a fellow athlete ‘if this subject is open to debate’.She added: ‘Calling me transphobic is just ridiculous – far from it. I have an opinion you don’t like... that’s that!’ Dame Kelly has lent her support to the Fair Play for Women campaign, which insists that female athletes are at a clear disadvantage against trans rivals.Tennis star Miss Navratilova has already clashed with Miss McKinnon in a row over male-born transgender athletes competing against biological women, branding it ‘cheating’.The Wimbledon champion and LGBT campaigner deplored the ‘tyranny’ of transgender activists who ‘denounce anyone who argues against them’.Miss Navratilova – who faced abuse and prejudice after coming out as gay in 1981 – accused Canadian Miss McKinnon of sending ‘bullying tweets’, and said her views had now ‘strengthened’.Long distance runner Miss Radcliffe has said tighter rules need to be applied if transgender women are to compete. IOC guidelines say transgender women must suppress testosterone levels for at least 12 months before they compete.She told the BBC: ‘People will manipulate this if there is an opening there to make money and win medals and we’ve seen the lengths people go to, the lengths Russia went to cheat in sport.’    Sharron Davies says the argument about trans women competing in female events is simply a matter of ‘biology’.The former Olympic swimmer, 56, claimed it was unfair to compete against those ‘who were born into a male body with all the advantages that will bring’.She told Radio 4’s Today programme that simple biology meant a transgender competitor would have a better ‘red blood cell count, increased lung capacity, better hand-eye co-ordination, longer limbs, denser bones, leaner muscle, bigger hearts’. Miss Davies, pictured, added: ‘Take swimming. Michael Phelps has got size 15 feet, your average female has size five or six feet, so if we were to move a man into swimming they would totally dominate all the women’s events.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"May urges EU leaders help persuade MPs Brexit deal","story":"Theresa May was in Grimsby today begging Brussels for concessions on the Irish border backstop and warned MPs who sink her deal there may be no Brexit at all if they do  The EU\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator outlined his position on Twitter.

Nine years ago it forced the BNP to drop its \u0027whites only\u0027 membership rule.Labour said it will co-operate fully with the EHRC, but said it rejects \u0027completely\u0027 any suggestion it has acted unlawfully. Last night moderate Labour MPs predicted high-level resignations.The move comes two days after it emerged that Mr Corbyn\u0027s aide Laura Murray sought to block the suspension of a member who described an anti-Semitic mural of a group of \u0027hook-nosed\u0027 men as \u0027great\u0027.It was reported yesterday that another ally of the leader, Thomas Gardiner, had intervened repeatedly to downgrade suspensions for anti-Semitism.The EHRC – which was founded by the Blair government – said it acted after receiving two dossiers showing examples where anti-Semitism was not dealt with properly by Labour. One was from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, and the other was from the Jewish Labour Movement.On a shameful day for Labour, Mr Corbyn remained silent over the threat of an investigation.Jewish Labour MP Ruth Smeeth, who has been subjected to anti-Semitic abuse, called it a \u0027devastating indictment\u0027. She added: \u0027Decent members will be horrified that we have got into this position. I welcome the EHRC intervention but today is another dark day in the history of our party which could and should have been avoided if concerns raised had been heeded last year.\u0027Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said he was \u0027deeply saddened\u0027 at the EHRC move.He said he would contact Labour general secretary Jennie Formby to ask for all relevant files and data to be retained \u0027so that investigators can form a clear picture of the processes and culture around Labour\u0027s response to anti-Semitism\u0027.Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, said it was \u0027utterly disgraceful and unacceptable\u0027 that the party had taken so long to deal with anti-Semitism.\u0027We need to remove this stain from our party, and we need to expel these despicable iniduals, so we can go into the next election, united by our historic values, not poisoned by this vicious disease,\u0027 she said.The EHRC will now contact Labour to set out its concerns. If the response is found to be unsatisfactory, it could launch a formal investigation.A spokesman for the watchdog said: \u0027Having received a number of complaints regarding anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, we believe Labour may have unlawfully discriminated against people because of their ethnicity and religious beliefs.      \u0027Our concerns are sufficient for us to consider using our statutory enforcement powers. As set out in our enforcement policy, we are now engaging with the Labour Party to give them an opportunity to respond.\u0027A Labour spokesman said: \u0027We completely reject any suggestion the party has acted unlawfully and will be co-operating fully with the EHRC. Labour is fully committed to the support, defence and celebration of the Jewish community and its organisations.\u0027Labour MP John Mann, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Anti-Semitism, predicted the EHRC\u0027s move would eventually lead to resignations of senior party figures.\u0027Obviously there will be resignations from those in power as this fully unfolds,\u0027 he said. \u0027Everyone should let the EHRC do its job.\u0027Gideon Falter, of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, said: \u0027It is a sad indictment that the once great anti-racist Labour Party is now being investigated by the equality and human rights regulator it established. Since the Holocaust, Britain has led the world in promoting human rights, and it could scarcely be more important to British society that the Jew hatred festering in the Labour Party is firmly brought to an end.\u0027The Jewish Labour Movement said it asked the EHRC in November last year to investigate the allegation that the Labour Party was \u0027institutionally anti-Semitic\u0027.

Just a few years previously it had been stripped of all its boardwalks as there had been mounting fears the Germans may have used it as a landing platform.

On a sunny day in Brighton, the town was swamped with people from all over south-east England, and especially from London.Usually families would stay in a seafront guesthouse or a ‘Hi-De-Hi’ style holiday camp, which offered a brief respite before the children would be back on the beach building sand castles, rock pooling or, more likely, begging for coins to feed the enticing arcade games.And what would a trip to the seaside be without a piece of rock?

Then it would be slowly stretched over 180 yards until the ‘Brighton Rock’ writing only measured a fraction of an inch.The pictured slab of candy would probably make just under 1,000 mouth-watering sticks of rock.

Companies that don\u0027t guarantee they know the age of their users face fines of up to 4 per cent of their global turnover – £1.67 billion in the case of Facebook (file photo) Firms that demand children are aged 13 or above – as most web giants do – will also have to demonstrate that they strictly enforce this policy.At the moment, web giants such as Facebook simply ask children to confirm their age by entering their date of birth without demanding proof.A spokesman for the ICO, which is headed up by Elizabeth Denham, said: \u0027We can confirm that websites seeking consent for sign up to online services aimed at children must seek parental consent if the child is under 13.\u0027We’ll also be clear in the code that organisations must be held to account for the age limit policies policies on their sites and how they implement them, when it is connected to collection and use of personal data.\u0027The code will also set out the importance of implementing the design standards for all users it they cannot verify the ages of children likely to use their service.\u0027These are new steps forward and we will consult on how they will work in practice. It’s important to stress the consultation.Trusted and (at some point in the future, certified) third parties can also provide age verification services to allow people to prove their age and identity without providing information directly to the service.\u0027One such example of the concept is the Governmnent’s Verify service.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Boy 16 overcomes autism struggles write novel","story":"    Freddie Ellison, from north London, was diagnosed with autism at the age of three. Now 16, he is set to have his first book published A 16-year-old boy who was diagnosed with autism at the age of three is set to have his first book published - and he\u0027s hoping to eventually become the next JK Rowling.Freddie Ellison, from north London, began writing in March 2017 after he was excluded from school.Having struggled with social interaction and communication, and with a tendency to engage in repetitive behaviours, Freddie spent the next 18 months out of education.While his parents battled to get him placed at an appropriate school, Freddie turned to writing as an outlet, often writing several stories at once.He soon established a routine, visiting his local coffee shop everyday where he would pen tale after tale.Now his first novel, Oliver Storm and The Great Disappearance, is set to be printed by SJH Publishing, with 25 per cent of the royalties going to the National Autistic Society. Freddie said: \u0027My favourite thing is reading and I really hope that people enjoy my first book.

Photograph: Eoin O’ShaughnessyThe recent discharge of wastewater sludge into Dublin Bay was mainly caused by an overload at the waste water treatment plant in Ringsend, rather than a mechanical or tank failure, the EPA has confirmed.Discharges into Dublin Bay from the waste water treatment plant in Ringsend were likely to continue until upgrade works at the overloaded plant are completed in 2023, it added. The facility services 40 per cent of the national population, who are based in the greater Dublin region – the equivalent of 1.9 million people – while Irish Water plans to add capacity for 400,000 people at a cost of €400 million. Meanwhile, separate analysis by Irish Water has concluded recent difficulties at the plant were exacerbated by construction rubble being fed into the city’s sewerage system as a result of increased building activity, and that the discharge was not normal sewage. Effluent from construction sites is allowed to be discharged into the system, but only under licence. The utility informed the EPA on Monday, February 25th about a breakdown within a section of the plant, which occurred on the morning of Saturday, February 23rd. It resulted in the discharge into the Lower Liffey Estuary. SpillageThe section of the plant where the breakdown occurred was shut down by 10am on the Saturday and the spillage ceased, though a large discharge into the bay at the outfall point 1 kilometre away in Poolbeg continued. It was photographed by an amateur photographer using a drone some eight hours later. The public and recreational users of Dublin Bay first became aware of the incident on Monday when The  published the photograph.The EPA confirmed this week that the section of the plant where the breakdown occurred was still shut down and repairs were being carried out, which are expected to take a month. “The shutdown of this section is causing a 5 to 8 per cent reduction in the treatment capacity of the already overloaded plant,” an EPA spokeswoman confirmed.Following a site inspection on Tuesday, February 26th, EPA inspectors concluded the incident was not the main underlying cause of the brown-coloured plume, which was photographed using the drone. Instead, the main likely causes were that the plant was “operating above its design capacity” and there were significant variations over time in the waste water load collected in Dublin’s sewers and entering the waste water treatment plant (WWTP) for treatment. “The solids entering the WWTP have risen in recent months and were twice the typical amount around the time the plume was photographed by a drone. The WWTP is unable to treat these additional solids adequately,” they concluded.SamplesThe EPA took samples of the discharge every day from Tuesday to Friday of last week. Preliminary results of the samples show the discharge was slightly above the emission limit values in the plant’s licence for “suspended solids” and chemical oxygen demand (COD). The inspectors also photographed and videoed the primary discharge point at Poolbeg and the effluent in the Ringsend discharge channel. They also conducted a partial drone survey of the area on the Thursday, with approval from the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). “However, we had to stop the drone flight early, when the CAA issued a flight restriction due to a fog forecast,” the spokeswoman added.“We have been liaising with Dublin City Council (DCC), who carry out sampling of the designated bathing waters and other locations adjacent to Dublin Bay. Results from the bathing water sample taken by DCC on February 26th at Dollymount Beach, which is the nearest designated bathing area, were within the ‘Excellent’ classification range for E. coli and Intestinal enterococci, indicating that the bathing water areas have not been impacted,” she said. Water quality in the area between the North and South Bull Walls, however, was likely to be of poorer quality, she added. The EPA took its own samples in Dublin Bay on Friday morning, March 1st. The results of that sampling are not yet available.The EPA said it was continuing to liaise closely with Irish Water on the issue. “However, it is likely the problems with the discharge will continue at this overloaded WWTP until the upgrade works are completed, between 2020 (phase 1) and 2023 (phase 2).”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Domestic violence one of suspected motives in deaths at apartment block, says PSNIDoctors failed to follow up treatment of Ruth Morrissey, who is now terminally ill, expert saysBarnier sends messages following meeting with the ambassadors of 27 EU statesFianna F\u0026aacuteil published Domestic Violence (Amendment) Bill to be introduced in D\u0026aacuteilJames Kavanagh (48) from Carlow granted early date to appeal three-year prison sentenceAppeal brought by a Pakistani man, an EU citizen woman and her childDischarges likely to continue until upgrade of Ringsend plant is completed, agency saysDefence counsel says John Paul Gantley will now leave woman \u0026lsquoalone for the rest of her life\u0026rsquoEric Norton sought damages over Dublin incident in which car, mobile home collidedMore than 250 schoolgirls attend launch of campaign at Google\u0026rsquos offices in DublinFormer Miss Ireland and restaurateur spouse had not made repayments in nine yearsFour businesses around country told to close over safety breaches in FebruarySean McVeigh from Lurgan guilty of planting bomb under car in Co DerryDragon vehicle which Nasa hopes to use for missions this year lands in Atlantic OceanNI Secretary of State meets with families concerned over her controversial commentsPanel of eight men and four women reject \u0026lsquoself defence\u0026rsquo claimWomen\u0026rsquos Aid says move is \u0026lsquomajor milestone in tackling domestic, sexual and gender based violence\u0026rsquoNorthern Secretary criticised in North and State for saying killings by soldiers, police \u0026lsquonot crimes\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3819333.1552067285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu s barnier says britain can exit customs union unilaterally","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier sent a series of messages on Twitter following a meeting with ambassadors from 27 EU states. File photograph: ReutersThe European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said that Britain could make a unilateral exit from the bloc’s customs union while maintaining the other elements of the Irish backstop.“EU commits to give UK the option to exit the Single Customs Territory unilaterally, while the other elements of the backstop must be maintained to avoid a hard border,” Mr Barnier said on Twitter after a meeting with the ambassadors of the remaining 27 EU states.“UK will not be forced into customs union against its will,” Mr Barnier added. His reference to the other elements of the Irish backstop indicate that if the UK left the customs union, Northern Ireland would remain aligned with the EU’s customs and regulatory rules in order to avoid a hard Irish border.Sources in Dublin said that the series of tweets were, in effect,largely underlining the position in the withdrawal agreement, though their timing was seen as politically signnificant. It is effectively offering the UK the option of returning to the original backstop plan, involving customs and regulatory alignment between North and South. Taosieach Leo Varadkar also mentioned this option in comments today. However replacing the UK-wide backstop with a Northern-Ireland only one – the original backstop plan – would face opposition from the DUP, as it would require further checks on goods crossing the Irish Sea. Their opposition to a customs border in the Irish Sea is one reason why the UK-wide customs union plan was developed.Also, while Mr Barnier’s latest proposal would make legally binding commitments of the assurances the EU offered to London in January, it is unlikely to be seen as enough by many of the harder eurosceptics in Mrs May’s Conservative party, which has no majority in parliament.The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement, he said. Sources in Dublin said that the tweets were politically significant, in that they reintroduced the idea of two backstop into the discussion, one involving a UK-wide customs union and one just involving the North. However it is not clear whether they will lead to any progress. The mood in Brussels has been downbeat after the failure of talks this week to reach any progress.– Reuters ( additional reporting by  staff) Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesVoters in Northern Ireland overwhelmingly reject a hard Brexit, would vote to remain in the European Union in a second referendum and would prefer checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and the North rather than checks on the Irish Border, according to a special Ipsos MRBI poll in Northern Ireland.A parallel poll in the Republic finds that almost half of all voters favour a referendum on Irish unity and a clear majority would vote in favour of reunification.The poll finds that Northern voters are deeply dissatisfied with the management of Brexit by the UK government and, most significantly, with the Democratic Unionist Party, with more than three-quarters of all voters saying they are dissatisfied with the UK government.Two-thirds of all voters (67 per cent) say the DUP is doing a bad job of representing Northern Ireland at Westminster, while 69 per cent of people – including 57 per cent of those from a Protestant background – are dissatisfied with DUP leader Arlene Foster.Checks on goodsStrikingly, the poll shows that in the event of a hard Brexit, more voters would favour checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than would favour checks on the Border.Almost half of all voters (48 per cent) disagree with Northern Ireland leaving the EU on the same terms as the UK if it means border checks in Ireland.But 59 per cent say they want a special arrangement for Northern Ireland for no checks on the Border – even if it means some checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and the North.But by far the biggest majority (67 per cent) is in support of a very soft Brexit where the UK stays in the EU single market and the customs union to avoid the need for checks anywhere.Northern voters are ided on whether there should be another Brexit referendum but if there was one, they would vote overwhelmingly (59 per cent) to remain in the EU.While voters are clearly at odds with the approach of the DUP to Brexit, they are also critical of Sinn Féin.Just 13 per cent of voters are satisfied with the way Sinn Féin’s Northern leader Michelle O’Neill is doing her job, with 61 per cent dissatisfied. A large majority – 60 per cent – of voters believe that Sinn Féin MPs should take their seats at Westminster. Among voters from a Catholic background, the figure rises to 64 per cent.Just over a third of Northern voters want a referendum on Irish unity. If one was held, just 32 per cent would vote in favour of unity, while 45 per cent would vote against. The number in favour of unity rises to 58 per cent among voters from a Catholic background, with 18 per cent against and 24 per cent who say they don’t know.Referendum on unityIn the Republic, the picture is different. Almost half of voters (49 per cent) say there should be a referendum on Irish unity, and if such a referendum was held, 62 per cent say they would vote in favour.The poll in the Republic was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week among a representative sample of 1,200 voters aged 18 and over in face-to-face interviews at 120 sampling points in all constituencies. The margin of error is plus or minus 2.8 per cent.Over half of southern voters (54 per cent) say they are satisfied with the way the Government has handled Brexit, but they are deeply ided on the choices that may face the Irish Government in the future.Asked if the Government should compromise on the backstop – the guarantee that there will be no hard border that has brought the Brexit talks to a standstill – in order to secure a deal and avoid a hard border, 43 per cent say the Government should compromise, while 42 per cent say that they should not compromise even if this risks a hard border.Voters are similarly ided when asked about the options if there is a hard border. Asked if there should be checks on goods at the border to avoid checks on goods going to the EU, 35 per cent agreed. Asked if the checks should be on goods going to the EU to avoid checks at the border, 33 per cent agreed."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3818302.1551988807!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit contents of cox s codpiece could swing meaningful vote","story":"UK Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has said he intends to look inside the Brexit \u0027codpiece\u0027 to ensure it\u0027s in working order as the latests talks on the backstop resume.

Photograph: Toby MelvilleReutersFileGeoffrey Cox was back in the House of Commons on Thursday for a mid-morning performance that owed as much to his am-dram experience in the Cambridge Footlights as to his years at the Old Bailey.The attorney general had little to boast about after a disastrous dinner in Brussels with Michel Barnier’s negotiating team, which left EU officials dismissing Britain’s latest proposals as “insane”.But Cox was in crowd-pleasing form, making a virtue of a disparaging term used by hardline Brexiteers to describe the concession he was seeking so that he could change his legal advice on the Northern Ireland backstop.“It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstop that will cause me to review and change my advice. That is government policy that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order,” he said.Theresa May’s hopes of winning a majority for her Brexit deal next Tuesday rest on persuading the DUP and hardline Conservative Brexiteers that Britain cannot be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.Downing Street perceives the DUP as the key to unlocking the support of all but a handful of diehard eurosceptics on the Conservative backbenches.The EU has ruled out a time limit or a unilateral withdrawal mechanism and Cox’s efforts are now focused on an arbitration mechanism to determine when the backstop can end.Minimising frictionDUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee on Wednesday that arbitration was unacceptable and that only Britain’s sovereign parliament and government should be allowed to determine how long the backstop lasts.Others in his party believe that arbitration could offer a way out of the backstop but that its effectiveness depends, as Cox told MPs on Thursday, on the question the arbitrator is asked.Cox told EU negotiators this week that instead of determining if both parties are acting in good faith, arbitrators should be asked if Britain had made reasonable efforts to find an alternative to the backstop.If the answer was yes, Britain should be allowed to replace the backstop – which would see the whole of the UK remain in a customs arrangement with the EU and Northern Ireland following some single market rules – with a “mini-backstop” that would seek to minimise friction on the Border.Cox will return to Brussels on Friday for talks that are expected to continue through the weekend. But the two sides are so far apart that it now appears unlikely that the attorney general will secure the changes he needs to change his legal advice and persuade the DUP to vote for the Brexit deal.The prime minister has promised to bring the deal back to the Commons by next Tuesday for a “meaningful vote” and that its defeat would be followed on Wednesday and Thursday by votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension to the article 50 negotiating period.Alternative offerIf a defeat on Tuesday is unavoidable, the government could offer MPs an additional vote similar to January’s Brady amendment which said the House would support the withdrawal agreement if the backstop was replaced with alternative arrangements to keep the Border open.If May wins a majority for an amendment outlining Cox’s arbitration proposal, she will still have to face votes on a no-deal Brexit and an extension. But she will have reduced further the price of Brexiteer support for her deal and demonstrated to the EU that such a concession would win a majority at Westminster.The prospect of delaying Brexit has weakened the incentive to compromise on all sides at Westminster as each faction believes that extra time gives their preferred option a better chance of success.A delay could allow backbench MPs to take control of the Brexit process as they seek to build a cross-party consensus behind a softer Brexit.Such an outcome, which could see Britain remaining in both the single market and the customs union, is a nightmare for Conservative Brexiteers.The DUP are relaxed about a delay, pointing out that the only form of Brexit that presents a real threat to unionism is May’s deal with the backstop in its current form.From a strictly unionist point of view all other options, including remaining in the EU, are acceptable.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

With more than 31,000 images posted, residents say Rue Crémieux, in the 12th arrondissement, near the Bastille, is becoming “the most Instagrammed street in Paris”.Antoine, a member of a neighbourhood association lobbying for gates to protect their privacy, said: “It may be a photographer’s paradise but for us it’s turned into hell here. At weekends we often get 200 people outside our windows. Our dining table is beside the window, and there are people just outside taking photos — rappers who take two hours to film a video under our windows or hen parties with people screaming for an hour. Frankly, it wears you down.”Alexandra, a student, said she went to Rue Crémieux to pose after seeing it on social media. “Influencers come here, they give the name of the street, so people following them also come.”A woman takes a photo of the colourful houses in Rue Crémieux where residents have asked for gates to be installed to keep tourists awayAnother young woman, Françoise, who also came to take photos, said most of those taking selfies did not realise how they were invading other people’s privacy. “The houses here are very different from most Paris architecture, so it’s unusual and interesting, but you tend to forget that there are actually people living here and it can be annoying for them.”Anne, another resident, said she did not mind a small number of people posing in the narrow street, but it had got out of hand. “Hundreds come every Saturday and Sunday and they seem to think it’s a public space and they don’t have to respect our privacy.”Antoine added: “It’s not too bad on weekdays when it’s mainly tourists who aren’t too annoying, but when the crowds come in at the weekend it gets unbearable.”A woman limbers up in a doorway on Rue Crémieux He puts up barricade tape every day to keep people away from his pastel blue house. Antoine and other members of the residents’ association have approached the 12th arrondissement town hall. “We want them to close the street, at least at the weekend and in the evening after a certain time. This is something that is done in private streets in Paris that have gates.”It is unclear if the local authorities will agree to turn Rue Crémieux into a gated community, however. Officials said they were considering various options and wanted to find a solution before the summer, but pointed out that there are many factors to take into account before restricting access to a public road.Residents of the Notting Hill area of London, which has similar pastel-coloured houses, complain of the same problem, but have so far stopped short of asking for gates.Vegan pie scoops top award and causes outrage among culinary eliteTens of thousands of Algerians take to the streets in unprecedented protest against 20-year-ruleSchool funding row deepens as ministers dismiss headteacher protest as \u0026#39ad hoc\u0026#39Brexit latest news: Michel Barnier dismisses Theresa May\u0026#39s \u0026#39blame game\u0026#39 as he restates backstop options Bring back National Service for 16-year-olds, says Chuka UmunnaJeremy Corbyn criticised by his peers over \u0026#39embarrassing\u0026#39 and \u0026#39humiliating\u0026#39 failure on anti-SemitismPeak District farmer forced to give up Highland Cattle after one dog walker complaintMonthly bin collections hailed a \u0026#39success\u0026#39 despite residents complaining of rats and stenchesChelsea Manning jailed for refusing to testify in inquiry into Julian Assange and WikiLeaksScottish Labour leader admits party struggling to cope with tide of antisemitism complaintsComment: Why we should all embrace the glorious comeback of the afternoon napGlasgow School of Art should have done more to safeguard building before fire, say MSPs Leaving Neverland: who is Brett Barnes, Michael Jackson’s ‘other boy’?Medical equipment and internet fails as Venezuela is plunged into darkness during 16-hour blackoutDuchess of Sussex: \u0026#39I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism\u0026#39Police seize assault rifle after stopping  car in south LondonWarning over lack of transparency in the development of vaccines Ross Kemp interview: \u0026#39I used to be such a pompous, self-indulgent twit\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/12/17/TELEMMGLPICT000183862787_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"facebook amazon choosing individual experience expense social","story":"Bezos merely invented Amazon we, the market, turned it into a behemothThe Amazon takeover is almost complete.

Once detected, separate instruments will define whether it sits in the so-called Goldilocks Zone, neither too hot, nor too cold for liquid water to form.Finally, researchers will study the chemical make up of the atmosphere, hunting for signs of gases like methane which could indicate that life is thriving on the surface.Mr Skidmore said: “Work to discover Earth-like planets around other stars may eventually lead to us answering the question of whether extra-terrestrial life exists.”Astronomers have so far found over 3,000 planets beyond our Solar System, but none, as yet, has been shown to be truly Earth-like in terms of its size and distance from a Sun similar to our own.  The new observatory, which launches in 2026, will be able to go further, looking not just for the planets themselves, but also evidence of life. The project is led by the European Space Agency but the suite of instruments will be designed by the University of Warwick.Professor Don Pollacco, University of Warwick, which leads the PLATO Science Management Consortium, said: “These planets will be close enough to facilitate a historic search for signs of life in their atmospheres using the next generation of large telescopes. “For the first time we will start to understand if life exists beyond the solar system.”The UK Space Agency also announced a further £7 million funding for a space weather mission to learn more about the dangers posed by the solar wind.The Solar wind Magnetosphere Ionosphere Link Explorer (Smile) mission will study the powerful ejections from the Sun which interact with the Earth\u0027s magnetosphere, and can potentially crippled satellites, power grids and communications networks.Space tourism: 10 ways you can leave planet EarthRecent research by Oxford University suggested that an intense solar storm could leave Britain with £16 billion worth of damage. The most severe incident - known as ‘the Carrington Event’ - happened in 1859, shorting  circuits, starting fires and causing the Northern Lights to dance in the sky as far south as Hawaii.In 1989, a geomagnetic disturbance caused a voltage collapse of Canada’s Hydro-Québec power grid, leaving six million inhabitants without power for nine hours and in 2005, X-rays from a solar flare disrupted the GPS system for about 10 minutesThe new UK funding will be used to develop a Soft X-ray Imager instrument, which will be designed by University of Leicester, University College London and the Open University, ahead of launch in 2023.Prof Graziella Branduardi-Raymont, Smile mission Co-Principal Investigator at UCL Mullard Space Science Laboratory, said: “Space weather remains one of the biggest risks facing humanity and Smile will make a fundamental contribution in furthering our scientific understanding to help mitigate it.”Professor Paul Monks, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and Head of College of Science and Engineering, University of Leicester, added: “SXI will be the first instrument to provide true global imaging of the solar wind exchange process within the magnetosphere. “The results of which will have meaningful implications for safeguarding our environment on Earth.”Announcing the funding at the start of British Science Week, Mr Skidmore added: “These two exciting space missions are brilliant examples of the UK’s space industry’s innovation and expertise.“Space weather – such as solar wind – is a potential threat to our communications systems here on Earth so this research examining how the wind interacts with our planet’s electromagnetic system.”Please review our commenting policyVegan

He also called for the ouster of all but one of the Debenhams’\u0026nbspboard, with finance chief\u0026nbspChris Wootton stepping up to become acting chief executive.The\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspshares shot up\u0026nbspbefore falling back to trade 13 per cent higher at 3.5p, still a tiny fraction of their peak of £2 back in 2006.Sports Direct, which owns 30 per cent of Debenhams, said it would provide more detail on its rationale for the radical shake-up in due course.Under the proposals, Mike Ashley would take executive control of Debenhams, without having to stump up the cash to buy the 70 per cent of shares that Sports Direct does not own.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Such an unnecessary change of CEO looks somewhat disrespectful to other shareholders of Sports Direct, but then, those who hold the stock must surely have already come to terms with Mike Ashley’s unorthodox style.”On Tuesday,\u0026nbspDebenhams\u0026nbspissued its fourth profit warning in quick succession.In February, the chain\u0026nbspreceived a £40m cash injection from lenders, allowing it to pursue long-term refinancing.However, on Tuesday, the group said “this process is likely to be disruptive to our business in the coming months”.Meanwhile, like-for-like sales in the first 18 weeks of the financial year dropped by 5.7 per cent, with UK sales down 6.2 per cent.We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway?

Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”“Whilst there are significant uncertainties in the months ahead, Greggs has started 2019 in great form, helped in part by the publicity surrounding the launch of our vegan-friendly sausage roll.“We hope to continue benefiting from this strong momentum during the first half of 2019 before facing stronger comparatives later in the year.“We have a strong financial position which we plan to use to invest in Greggs’ potential for further growth, whilst also delivering good returns for shareholders.”January’s news that Greggs was to sell a vegan-friendly sausage roll drew a flurry of responses online, including comments from Good Morning Britain TV host Piers Morgan and comedian Ricky Gervais.Greggs sells 1.5 million sausage rolls a week but created the new option due to public demand after an online petition by Peta, calling for a vegan version, was signed by more than 20,000 people last year.Its popularity has already led to Greggs lifting its 2019 profit outlook.Greggs was also helped by the growth of healthier options, hot drinks, breakfast and hot food and said that it has had a “very strong” start to 2019.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce.

You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match. It’s hard not to relate to the moment Liz Gilbert (Julia Roberts) bites into a piece of authentic Italian pizza, during the Naples stop on her global adventure of self-discovery, and declares: “I’m in love. I’m in a relationship with my pizza.”820 Beauty \u0026amp the BeastAlthough we might not fully be convinced that the grey stuff is delicious, the “dinner and show” approach to Lumiere (Jerry Orbach)’s hospitality is something we could certainly get used to. In Disney’s 1991 animation, Belle (Paige O\u0027Hara) is presented with a whole cavalcade of sumptuous dishes: including beef ragout, cheese souffle, pie and pudding en flambe. And there’s a sage piece of advice to go with it all, too: “If you\u0027re stressed, it\u0027s fine dining we suggest!” Indeed. While there’s been a growing fad of ambitious, unusually themed cakes – you need only look at the success of the TLC reality series Cake Boss – there are few cinematic cakes that quite stick in the memory like Jackson (Dylan McDermott)’s armadillo-shaped groom cake from 1989 comedy-drama Steel Magnolias, a spin on the tradition from the American South of having another cake separate to the main wedding cake. And did we mention that it’s red velvet on the inside? When it came to director Sofia Coppola conjuring the ultimate image of decadence for her 2006 biopic on the French queen, there was no more perfect treat than Ladurée’s famous macarons. Delicate and pastel-toned, the meringue-based confection has long been the speciality of the French bakery, first established in 1862. A new flavour was even created in honour of the film, with the Marie Antoinette offering a combination of rose and anise flavours.Food is often regarded as one of the best ways to understand a culture, and The Hundred-Foot Journey is wonderful for showing the efforts the talented, self-taught novice Hassan (Manish Dayal) goes to in order to comprehend that. During a picnic he reveals he has mastered the five “mother sauces” of French cuisine, and the delicate tasting process that follows demonstrates just how important food is to France.“In prison, dinner was always a big thing.” So much so that the Wise Guys ate better than most people on the outside. “Beyond the Sea” plays in the background as the gangsters prepare their meal: Garlic sliced so thin with a razor blade that it would “liquefy in the pan with just a little oil”, meatballs in a tomato sauce that’s “a little too oniony”, steak cooked medium rare, iced lobsters, prosciutto, salami, cheese, red wine and good Scotch. Maybe crime does pay after all.There are few pleasures in life more fulfilling than that of cooking for others. In Chocolat – based on the book by Joanne Harris – a slow-motion scene where dinner party guests tuck into the feast created by expert chocolatier Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) is full of warmth and laughter.In a world where people seem more than happy to fork out £15 for some mushy avocado on toast, $5 for a milkshake doesn’t seem too unreasonable. Vincent Vega (John Travolta) takes his boss’ wife Mia (Uma Thurman) out to Jack Rabbit Slim’s for a burger, where she decides she wants the “$5 dollar shake”. “You don’t put bourbon in it or nothing?” a bewildered Vincent asks the waiter. When it arrives, Mia takes a long sip: “Yummy.” “I gotta know what a $5 shake tastes like,” Vincent says. He takes a sip. Then another. “Goddamn, that’s a pretty f***ing good milkshake.”Nora Ephron’s feature film based on the intertwining stories of chef Julia Child and Julie Powell, the blogger who rose to fame after documenting her pledge to cook all 524 recipes in Child’s cookbook, is all about the joy one can find in food. It is some of the earlier scenes that capture this best, like when Julia (Meryl Streep) and her husband Paul (Stanley Tucci) arrive in Paris and stop at a French restaurant, where Julia is served a sizzling platter of sole. It looked so mouth-watering in the final edit that Ephron “wanted to call up Martin Scorcese and say, ‘you’ve never shot a fish like that before’”.  Fearsome critic Anton Ego takes a bite of ratatouille and is transported back to his childhood, where it was a favourite comfort food, in the best scene from Pixar’s wonderful animated film. The detail is superb, from the process of Remy the rat preparing the dish to the moment Ego’s pen falls to the ground as he remembers the power of a favourite meal in evoking memories we thought were lost.“I don’t want this, I want large bread… but I can rise above it, I’m a professional.” The miniature bread catastrophe is a beautiful parody on every self-absorbed rock star to have kicked off over something as ludicrous as the food they’re served backstage. Guitarist Nigel Tufnell sits next to a tray of sandwiches looking baffled as his manager walks over. Look, he says, picking up a sandwich. This, this miniature bread. It\u0027s like... I\u0027ve been working with this now for about half an hour. I can\u0027t figure it out. Let\u0027s say I want a bite, right, you\u0027ve got this... After all the trauma she has been through – at the hands of her abusive husband and a racist ex-employer – Minny (Octavia Spencer) arrives at her employer Celia Foote to find a beautiful dinner cooked for her as a thank you for everything she has done for Celia and her husband. You see the care that has gone into it as Celia lays everything out on the table, from a “mile high meringue” to the fried chicken Minny taught her how to make. “That table of food gave Minny the strength she needed,” the narration explains. “She took her babies out from under Leroy and never went back.”It was a scene that helped propel a revolution in American dining. Il Timpano, a dish inspired by the notoriously tricky-to-make Italian meal, is the star of a moment in Big Night where chef brothers Primo (Tony Shalhoub) and Secondo (Stanley Tucci) prepares it as the centrepiece for a feast attended by their rival, Pascal. “Goddamit, I should kill you,” he screams, throwing his fork down after tasting Il Timpano. “This is so f***ing good, I should kill you.”120 Lady \u0026amp the TrampWho would have guessed one of the most romantic scenes in cinema would involve two dogs eating scraps in an alleyway? And, yet, the iconic spaghetti kiss from Disney’s 1955 animated film has been oft imitated but never surpassed, as the two pups indulge in an Italian delicacy, all soundtracked to Sonny Burke and Peggy Lee’s “Bella Notte”. And, as Tramp proves, there’s no greater act of chivalry than offering your date the last meatball… Gabriel Axel’s Oscar-winning 1987 Danish film is a visual treat for any self-confessed gourmand. The story sees two pious Protestant sisters offer refuge to a French woman fleeing the political tumult in Paris after the collapse of the Second Empire in 1871. They agree to hire her as a housekeeper, All the very best chefs know that a dash of pure imagination is key to creating a true culinary wonder. It’s a lesson well-taught in Steven Spielberg’s 1991 classic, Hook, as a grown-up Peter Pan (Robin Williams) looks on in disbelief as the Lost Boys tuck into what appears to be nothing at all. It’s only when he truly believes that he can see the brightly colour feast laid out before him. And what childish feast would be complete without an old fashioned food fight? 420 Breakfast at Tiffany\u0027sSure, the 1961 film’s title may be a little misleading. Its protagonist, Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn), in reality only has breakfast outside of Tiffany’s, popping out of a cab in the early morning light to peer into the jewelry shop window, all while enjoying a pastry and some coffee in a paper. The moment has still remained the peak of glamour, decades later, so who cares if it’s all a little white lie?It’s a classic scene that proves to be surprisingly instructional. Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 film has a full-blown recipe tucked within its elegant drama, as Vito Corleone’s close associate, Peter Clemenza (Richard Castellano), offers his version of the perfect pasta sauce. As he explains: “You start out with a little bit of oil. Then you fry some garlic. Then you throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste, you fry it you make sure it doesn\u0027t stick. You get it to a boil you shove in all your sausage and your meatballs. And a little bit of wine, and a little bit of sugar—that\u0027s my trick.620 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate FactoryAlthough the 1971 musical is, as a whole, a sugary delight, it’s hardest to resist the temptation of Willy Wonka’s Fizzy Lifting Drinks, a soda described as so bubbly that it lifts anyone who drinks it right off the ground. It’s no wonder that it was the one stop on the tour that ended up tempting the pure-hearted Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) and his grandfather (Jack Albertson). Now, the real question is: does it come in different flavours?For anyone who considers pizza to be the true love of their life, Ryan Murphy’s 2010 romcom is a perfect cinematic match.

They killed many of the 123 British soldiers and 42 Royal Ulster Constabulary police who died there\u0026nbspbetween 1970 and 1997. Described by British home secretary Mervyn Rees as “bandit country”, the area\u0026nbspwas so dangerous for British forces personnel that they only travelled by helicopter. \u0026nbspBritain Before Brexit: a portrait of Northern IrelandThose lethal wires linked to explosives are long gone thanks to the Good Friday Agreement (GFA) of 1998, but in a broader sense the 310-mile-long border that ides Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic itself constitutes a trip wire which, if touched or interfered with in any way, has the capacity to trigger a political explosion that could end 20 years of peace.\u0026nbspThe removal of the physical border with its hundreds of blocked and cratered roads and blown bridges, channelling traffic through a few heavily guarded military checkpoints, was an essential part of the GFA.Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalist communities, which each make up about half of the 1.9 million population of Northern Ireland, could choose to be British or Irish without either being able to dominate the other. A stable balance of power between the two was held in place by an elaborate structure of institutions and laws negotiated by the leading nationalist and unionist parties of the day and buttressed by the British and Irish governments\u0026nbspacting in cooperation along with the EU.\u0026nbspThis structure has maintained a hard-won peace for over two decades, but it is now crumbling under the impact of Brexit. The referendum of 2016 opened the way for – indeed made it difficult to avoid – the resurrection of the border as an international frontier between an Irish Republic as a member of the EU, with all its rules and regulations, and the UK determined to be outside it.\u0026nbspThe radicalism and gravity of what is proposed by the Brexiteers is masked by mumbo-jumbo about “backstops”, “hard borders”\u0026nbspand “max fac” (maximum facilitation) borders that will somehow be automatically monitored by technical gadgetry which, though\u0026nbspyet to be invented, will apparently be sure to make any human presence unnecessary.The debate about the “backstop”\u0026nbspin the UK ignores the political and demographic realities on the ground in Northern Ireland.Ryanair boss calls May and Corbyn ‘idiots’ and demands end to BrexitThe threat to a hard border is often portrayed as coming from dissident Republican groups that never accepted the GFA.But these are small, fragmented, under surveillance by MI5 and lack popular nationalist support. More likely are spontaneous protests by farmers and local people on the border determined to prevent an international frontier once again cutting through their neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspAll this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them.\u0026nbspMuch of the border runs through land populated (on both sides) by a majority of Catholics and nationalists.\u0026nbspAny new barrier would probably in practice require the deployment of military force.After all, the EU is like a club which requires porters at the door to keep non-members out\u0026nbsp– or ensure that, if they do enter, they abide by the club’s rules and regulations. In the case of\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland, s at the gate would be customs and other regulatory officials, but these could not be stationed there in the face of local nationalist opposition without police protection and the police would not come without the deployment of the British Army, which\u0026nbspwould presumably operate from a network of fortified positions,\u0026nbsppotentially even\u0026nbspblocking many of the 300 roads crossing the border – as they did in the past.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe “backstop” is portrayed as an insurance policy under which all of the UK would remain in the customs union if the UK and EU cannot agree some other way of avoiding a “hard border”. But the latter could not be recreated without reigniting the Northern Ireland conflict, something that neither nationalists nor unionists want to happen, but that might be brought about by the momentum of events, just\u0026nbspas it was in Northern Ireland in 1968-69.\u0026nbspSome supporters of Brexit argue naively that the UK government could solve the problem by allowing almost free passage of people and vehicles and relying on cooperation and goodwill to ensure that their passage, and the goods they carry, will be registered electronically.Feeney is scathing about such plans, saying: “All this stuff about bar codes and cameras is nonsense because only the good guys will obey them. The rest would cross the border from Cavan and Monaghan where there are no bar codes or anything else.”Cheap but illegal Brazilian beef and American chicken would thus flood out of the UK and into the EU through the unguarded Northern Ireland breach in its defences. The EU could not permit a trade deal with the\u0026nbspUK that allowed Northern Ireland to become a smugglers’ paradise.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the problem of the Irish border is not primarily about trade and commerce, important though these may be.What is really at issue here – and the “backstop” is unwittingly at the centre of this – is the shifting balance of power between the Catholics and Protestants on the island of\u0026nbspIreland.\u0026nbspBrexit may be isive in England but is even more so in Northern Ireland because it plugs into the 400-year struggle between the two communities, a historic confrontation which over the last hundred years has\u0026nbspgained its most visible expression in the island’s partition.\u0026nbspMany observers in Northern Ireland are frightened by the seeming carelessness with which the British government and the Conservative Party have presided over the rebirth of\u0026nbspthe Irish Question. They appear to ignore its toxic legacy as an issue that has bedevilled British politics from the First Home Rule Bill in 1886 until the partition of Ireland in 1921, and again during the 30-year conflict from the first Catholic civil rights march in 1968 to the GFA in 1998. \u0026nbspThe latter agreement was under pressure but was working until the Brexit vote in the UK reopened old issues and old wounds. Northern Ireland voted Remain by 56 to 44 per cent but sectarian isions have widened.Why looming collapse of cash as a means of payment is a Brexit issueJust how bad tends to be underestimated in Westminster because British politicians, aside from Tony Blair, have traditionally had a blind spot about Ireland until things go irredeemably wrong and it is too late to do anything about them. The same is largely true of the British media according to commentators in Belfast.“Those that covered the conflict 20 years ago catch on pretty quickly about what is happening here,” one local journalist told me. “Those that are here for the first time are completely bewildered because they don’t know what happened in the past.”\u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPeople who live in Northern Ireland have an acute sense of how problems that had been neutered, though\u0026nbspnot resolved, by the GFA are stirring into life.“I am grappling with the idea of a hard border which I would call a Second Partition of Ireland,” says Tom Hartley, a Sinn Fein veteran and former lord mayor of Belfast. He is baffled by British actions that appear so much against their interests, saying that “they had parked the Irish problem, but now Ireland has moved once again into the centre of British politics”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Neither the nationalist community nor Sinn Fein, which has won more than two-thirds of the nationalist vote in Northern Ireland in recent elections, wants to go back to war.Nationalists have done well out of the peace. Catholics\u0026nbspno longer face religious discrimination when it comes to jobs, housing and justice, as they did in 1968.Irish TV host tears up as she lists Troubles victims in Brexit warningSinn Fein are conscious that demographically the nationalist community is growing faster than the loyalist one:\u0026nbspalready 51 per cent of school children are Catholics compared to 37 per cent who are Protestants. Within two years, the Catholics may be the majority of the voting population, though this does not necessarily guarantee political power.I lived in Belfast between 1972 and 1975 writing a PhD about Joe Devlin, the northern nationalist leader in the first decades of the 20th century, at the Institute of Irish Studies which was part\u0026nbspof Queens University. These were the worst years of the Troubles. In 1972 alone some 479 people were killed, including 135 soldiers, and 4,876 were injured.Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement that established long term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of BrexitI got used to the sounds of bombs and gunfire and the sectarian geography of Belfast became imprinted on my brain. Along with the rest of the population, I automatically calculated the real proximity of danger without giving the matter much thought.I once showed a visiting American publisher around the city and, years later, he told me that he had been struck by one moment during our tour when he had queried me about the route we were taking, saying: “I thought you said this street was dangerous?” And I had replied, as if stating the obvious: “No, I said that that side of the street was dangerous, but the side we are on is safe.”\u0026nbspAlmost everything is safe in Belfast today, though the sectarian boundaries are largely the same as they were 50 years ago.I drove through the site of Harland and Wolff shipyard that at its peak employed 35,000 men, almost all Protestants from east Belfast. Today it is the site of the Titanic exhibition which is, along with other developments, dwarfed by the enormous yellow gantry crane marked H \u0026amp W in giant letters. Housing is, and has always been, segregated in Belfast and east Belfast remains a Protestant stronghold, aside from a small Republican nationalist enclave called Short Strand pressed up against the Lagan river. It is protected by one of the many peace lines or walls in the city topped by metal staves.“They got higher when the Protestants discovered catapults,” said a local observer, who pointed to the grills over the windows and the slates on the roofs that look normal but are made out of metal so they do not break when stones hurled over the peace wall hit them.\u0026nbspI once had a shabby flat off the Antrim Road in north Belfast, but I could not remember the name of the street. This used to be a particularly murderous part of Belfast because of the jigsaw puzzle of Protestant and Catholic districts permanently engaged in low level war against each other, most often in the shape of tit-for-tat or retaliatory killings.“Get your retaliation in first,” was an old Belfast joke, though retaliation was not necessarily local. If a Catholic was killed in Short Strand where the Catholics were weak and outnumbered, then the retaliatory killing of a Protestant might be arranged from Ardoyne, where the Catholics were strong and well organised.Likewise, if a Protestant UDR (Ulster Defence Regiment) soldier was shot by the IRA in County Fermanagh 70 miles to the west, there might be a tit-for-tat revenge murder of a Catholic in Belfast.\u0026nbspPeace may have come but militant commemorative murals showing fallen heroes and historic scenes on the side walls of houses are repainted every few years.“The Republican ones became rather ethereal a few years ago, but now they are showing more guns,” commented a friend. One enormous mural on a wall in the Ardoyne shows a wounded James Connolly, the socialist leader, in the GPO in Dublin during the Easter Rising in 1916. \u0026nbspDerry Girls and MPs stage Northern Ireland abortion protestWhy abortion remains illegal in Northern IrelandMPs urge government to redraft new domestic abuse billElaborate\u0026nbspcommemorative shrines to fallen Republican martyrs, who died fighting the British security forces, are common all over west Belfast, the political heart of the northern nationalist community. But the British Army fortresses in the area have all gone, the places where they once stood used for public housing or community centres. The Falls Road, which\u0026nbspused to be one of the world’s most menacing streets, looks spruce and cheerful with fewer closed shops than most British cities.I had mostly lived close to Queens University during my three years in Belfast, but when I went back the houses along University Road had been demolished, which was no great loss, and replaced with better looking buildings. The pub where I used to drink, the Club Bar, had been replaced, so far as I could see, by a small Tesco store.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCould Belfast and Northern Ireland go back to the three-cornered battle between Protestants, Catholics and the British security forces which I had witnessed?Everybody in Northern Ireland has a lot to lose and not a lot to gain, but some of the most important struts of the agreement\u0026nbspthat established long-term peace have been cut away by the British government in pursuit of Brexit or because some in its ranks see the GFA as a Labour project that mistakenly diluted British control over Northern Ireland. \u0026nbspThe bits of the GFA that have been abandoned are important.\u0026nbspThe British government is meant to be neutral between unionists and nationalists so as to enable it to play a mediating role between the two communities. David Cameron and later Theresa May have shown their support for the unionists, a bias that became total when Ms May\u0026nbspbecame reliant on the DUP for her parliamentary majority.Similarly, the British and Irish governments were supposed to cooperate if local power sharing arrangements failed, as they have\u0026nbspbut the government has shown increasing hostility to the nationalists in the north and to any role by the Dublin government.The most destabilising factor in Northern Ireland today is the British government itself.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Norway has sought to project an image as a responsible environmental steward while pumping millions of barrels of oil and gas.Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction, said Norway\u0027s announcement showed that investors are growing impatient\u0026nbspwith oil exploration companies.Institutional investors are withdrawing their capital from oil and gas companies on the grounds that quicker-than-expected growth in clean energy and associated regulation is making oil and gas business models highly vulnerable.This announcement will put pressure on investors to ramp up their engagement with integrated oil majors ahead of the AGM season.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

This\u0026nbspallowed\u0026nbspthe screen to blend into the wall behind it.TVs are turns on for only five hours a day on average, yet they occupy a large space on the wall in the living room,\u0026nbspthe firm\u0026nbspsaid at the time.\u0026nbspThis means TVs hang on the wall just as a black screen for more than 19 hours every day. With a TV turned off, it is easier to see dust or fingerprints on the screen – especially when the screen is large.Efforts to minimise the visual impact of wires trailing behind the TV have also been made previously, with high-end sets now shipping with Samsung\u0027s OneConnect box.Galaxy Fold: Samsung plans two more foldable phonesIt works by combining all the wires into one cable that can be threaded relatively tidily up to the TV.\u0026nbspSamsung already makes use of wireless power technology in some of its devices, including its flagship range of Galaxy S10 smartphones.There is no word yet on when a wireless television\u0026nbspmight be released and Samsung does not comment on rumours surrounding unreleased products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year.\u0026nbspFriday morning’s splashdown was the final hurdle of SpaceX’s six-day test flight.Minutes before splash-down, Crew Dragon deployed its four parachutes, easing some concerns about functionality that both NASA and SpaceX had before the landing.Everything happened just perfectly, right on time the way that we expected it to, Benjamin Reed, SpaceX\u0027s director of crew mission management, said in a live stream from California.The test mission was a crucial milestone in the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u0027s Commercial Crew Program ahead of SpaceX\u0027s first crewed test flight slated to launch in July with U.S. astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken.SpaceX launches historic test flight for future manned missionsThis really is an American achievement that s many generations of NASA administrators and over a decade of work by the NASA team, current Administrator Jim Bridenstine said after the splash-down.The vehicle is doing well. The recovery crews are out. They\u0027re on the scene, said Steve Stich, the crew program\u0027s deputy manager with NASA.A boat was in the zone where Dragon hit the Atlantic and was set to lift the 16-foot spacecraft out of the water about one hour after splash-down using a crane. It will carry the craft back to land by Sunday.The first-of-a-kind mission brought 400 pounds of test equipment to the space station, including a dummy named Ripley outfitted with sensors around its head, neck, and spine to monitor how a flight would feel for a human.The space station\u0027s three-member crew greeted the capsule last Sunday, with U.S. astronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques entering Crew Dragon\u0027s cabin to carry out air quality tests and inspections.NASA has awarded SpaceX and Boeing Co a total of $6.8 billion to build competing rocket and capsule systems to launch astronauts into orbit from American soil, something not possible since the U.S. Space Shuttle was retired from service in 2011.The launch systems are aimed at ending U.S. reliance on Russian Soyuz rockets for $80 million-per-seat rides to the $100 billion orbital research laboratory, which flies about 250 miles (400 km) above earth.Bridenstine told Reuters the cost per seat on the Boeing or SpaceX systems would be lower than for the shuttle or Soyuz.Privately owned SpaceX, also known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, was founded in 2002 by Musk, who is also a co-founder of electric car maker Tesla.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s aiming for a morning splashdown in the Atlantic off Florida’s coast, the final hurdle of the six-day test flight. Saturday’s launch and Sunday’s docking were spot on.\u0026nbspNASA astronauts have been stuck riding Russian rockets since space shuttles retired eight years ago. NASA is counting on SpaceX and Boeing to start launching astronauts this year. SpaceX is aiming for summer.(For context, there\u0027s no way the US can do this at the moment: its hope was always the Space Shuttle programme, so when that was cancelled it was left without a way of travelling up and down. Now it has to rely on the Russian space agency, which it pays to take astronauts to the ISS.\u0026nbspIf this works, it could change all that, by completing a plan to let private US companies build the rockets and capsules that will allow them to fly to space again. So it\u0027s a big day for Nasa and space travel generally, as well as SpaceX.)We\u0027re not going to\u0026nbspsee\u0026nbspevery part of the mission because of a communications blackout.

UK will not be forced into a customs union against its will,” he said.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentHe added that the\u0026nbsparbitration panel already included in the withdrawal agreement can,\u0026nbsp”under Article 178 of the withdrawal agreement, give the UK the right to a proportionate suspension of its obligations under the backstop, as a last resort, if EU breaches its best endeavoursgood faith obligations to negotiate alternative solutions”.He said the bloc would also “give legal force to all commitments from the January letter from the European Council president and European Commission president through joint interpretative statement”.“The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement,” he concluded.Pound falls after May warns of \u0027moment of crisis\u0027 over BrexitTheresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says \u0027we may never leave the EU\u0027 if MPs reject her Brexit dealWhen are the key upcoming Brexit votes?But the chief negotiator’s\u0026nbspslate of proposals designed to make the backstop less uncontroversial in Westminster does not change its fundamental nature, which\u0026nbspMPs have been objecting to.On Tuesday the House of Commons will again vote on Theresa May\u0027s Brexit deal – after rejecting it last time by a historic margin of defeat. If the agreement is rejected again the government has promised to give MPs votes on whether to rule out a no-deal Brexit, and whether to extend article 50. These votes are expected on Wednesday and Thursday of this week respectively.Polling commissioned by the  and conducted by Ipsos MRBI shows Northern Irish votes overwhelmingly reject a hard Brexit, and that 67 per cent think the DUP is doing a bad job of representing Northern Ireland at Westminster.\u0026nbsp69 per cent of Northern Irish people - including 57 of those with a Protestant background, say they are dissatisfied with DUP leader Arlene Foster. Notably, more voters favour checks on goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland than do\u0026nbspchecks at the Irish border.Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar\u0026nbspsaid on Friday morning that it should be Theresa May offering the UK concessions if she wanted changes to the withdrawal agreement.

There can be no more playing for time.”EU says Britain can leave backstop but Northern Ireland must stayHowever, he also insisted Labour was not “obsessed” by Brexit like other parties – pointing to poverty and climate change as the issues that really matter.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliament“Turn on the news at the moment and you’ll hear endlessly about constitutional issues.

It’s working class people who will lose their jobs as resources run dry.“And it’s working class people who will be left behind as the rich escape rising sea levels.”Theresa May should be offering Brexit concessions to EU, says Irish PMMay says \u0027we may never leave the EU\u0027 if MPs reject her Brexit dealWhy can\u0027t EU and UK find a solution to the Irish backstop controversy?Strip Home Office of immigration policy post-Brexit, report suggestsGordon Brown calls for year-long Brexit delayNevertheless, the dismissal of Brexit as for “obsessives” will alarm Labour MPs desperate for Mr Corbyn to swing indisputably behind the campaign for a Final Say referendum.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Political editor Joe Watts explain whyClick to followIndy PoliticsGeoffrey Cox has found himself in the growing dictionary of BrexitismsThere was a bizarre moment in the Commons on Thursday when MPs appeared more concerned with an item of Tudor attire that covered a man’s dignity, than they were with governing the country.The codpiece, as modelled by Henry VIII in almost any portrait, is a sort of upturned pouch designed to shield and also draw attention to a gentleman’s crotch.But the word’s vague similarity\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspattorney general Geoffrey Cox’s surname\u0026nbspand to a particular legal device, means it has now entered the growing dictionary of Brexitisms that afflicts our news copy.Phrases such as “the Malthouse compromise”, “the Brady amendment”, “Canada plus, plus, plus”, “Maximum Facilitation”, “Max Fac 2”, \u0026nbsp“the backstop” and “the backstop to the backstop” will now be joined by “Cox’s codpiece”.It manifested out of Cox’s efforts to secure a new addition to Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement – he wants to use a legal instrument to create\u0026nbspa legally binding way for the UK government to say it wants Britain to leave the dreaded “backstop”\u0026nbsp(an arrangement the UK could otherwise be trapped in indefinitely if it fails to secure a future trade deal with the EU by 2020).Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.But the device he is seeking to use is in legal circles called a codicil – which no-one really knew how to say beyond a courtroom until this month – and so it was replaced with “codpiece”.The phrase finally sealed its place in the Brexit dictionary when the man himself told MPs on Thursday: “It is government policy to achieve the necessary change in the backstopBrexit department’s top civil servant to retire just as UK to leave EU“That is government policy, that is the subject of the discussions that we are having. I would say that it has come to be called ‘Cox’s codpiece’. What I am concerned to ensure is that what is inside the codpiece is in full working order.”A canny way for the attorney general to avoid answering what had actually been quite a difficult question on the government’s approach.The problem for Mr Cox is that as far as anyone can tell at this point, it does not look like his negotiations to secure a codicil or an addendum or an annexe or anything else to\u0026nbspthe agreement are going anywhere.The EU – which is adamant that the backstop in its current form should remain untouched – said that there is no solution to the impasse in sight.If Cox cannot achieve an adequate change, the government will\u0026nbspnot get the support of Tory MPs and the DUP, and the government’s deal falls.The irony maybe that, given the intransigence in Brussels, whatever the attorney general does come back with in a bid to convince Tory Eurosceptics, may represent an altogether different item of biblical attire.

He said the UK would have the unilateral right to leave the customs union, but he also made clear Northern Ireland would have to stay inside it.PM delivers speech in last ditch plea for EU to give ground in Brexit negotiationsMichel Barnier says UK would have unilateral right to leave customs unionMay criticised for only taking one question from a woman on International Women\u0027s DayNorthern Ireland secretary says I do not believe what I said\u0027 after Troubles killing remarkBelgium tells companies to halt exports to UK after 29 MarchA source in Theresa May’s government has said Downing Street is “not impressed” by Michel Barnier’s gesture on the customs union, Reuters is reporting.\u0026nbspAnd a DUP source has described\u0026nbspthe EU’s chief negotiator move is a “non-starter”. A party spokesperson said Mr Barnier’s proposal to leave the UK leave the backstop unilaterally – but keep Northern Ireland inside it – showed “no respect to the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom,” according to Sky News.Apparently the Home Office has prepared a “highly visible” publicity campaign to mark the full launch of its\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspsettlement scheme.\u0026nbspAdverts encouraging EU nationals to apply to secure their status in the UK will be rolled out across the country within weeks. The marketing blitz is earmarked to go live in the days before Britain formally departs on March 29, the Press Association is reporting.\u0026nbspThe campaign will include outdoor advertising on billboards, at bus stops and rail stations, with a particular focus on areas with high populations of EU citizens.\u0026nbspThe Home Office has allocated around £3.75 million for the first phase of the initiative. Material will also be pushed out on radio, catch-up TV, social media and websites.Ministers have been warned that the government\u0027s rejection of calls for a meaningful vote in parliament on post-Brexit trade deals may come back to haunt it in the coming months.International Trade Committee chairman Angus MacNeil said it was crucial for parliament to be informed and onside for the government to achieve its Brexit plans - with free trade agreements at the centre.The committee called for the government to provide MPs with a yes or no vote on the ratification of future trade deals in a report published in December, but it was rejected.In its response, the government said it was their role to negotiate and enter into international treaties, adding: This serves an important function: it enables the UK to speak clearly, with a single voice, as a unitary actor under international law.However, the Government is committed to ensuring that parliament is able to shape and inform negotiations throughout the process and not just at the end.The SNP\u0027s Mr MacNeil said: The Brexit process has shown that the government must keep parliament informed and onside if it wants to achieve its Brexit ambitions - central to which are free trade agreements.The government\u0027s failure to provide parliament with a meaningful role before and after negotiations may come back to haunt it in the months and years to come.The Independent Group lead spokesman, Chuka Umunna, said: Members of Parliament have consistently rejected the Prime Minister\u0027s flawed deal because it will harm the UK\u0027s businesses and jobs.It involves paying a gigantic orce bill, with no certainty on our future EU trading relationship in return. But the Prime Minister has put her head in the sand and refuses to listen.Theresa May is too busy negotiating with her own party, and putting Tory party unity ahead of the national interest, to build a consensus around a proposition which could command a majority in the House of Commons. That has been the persistent problem throughout this whole process.The only way to resolve this is to have a series of indicative votes in the House of Commons on the various Brexit options, and to hold a People\u0027s Vote on whichever one commands a majority.The EU\u0027s\u0026nbspchief Brexit negotiator\u0026nbspMichel Barnier\u0026nbsphas reacted\u0026nbspto Theresa May\u0027s speech.He told reporters in Brussels: The EU stands united. We are not interested in the blame game.He added: We are still working.Labour\u0027s recent shift in favour of backing a\u0026nbspsecond Brexit referendum could fail to deliver a People\u0027s Vote, a member of Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s frontbench team has conceded.Lesley Laird, the shadow Scottish secretary, said while the party would keep fighting there is not sufficient support in the Commons for a Final Say vote\u0026nbspto get the go-ahead.In a speech to the Scots Labour conference, she said: Labour will not accept Theresa May\u0027s botched Brexit. And Labour will certainly not accept no deal.With the PM facing a series of crunch votes in the Commons next week, she added: Parliamentary processes will soon be exhausted with all options explored.And if there is no resolution that meets our tests then, as our conference motion compels us to do, we will seek to put it back to the people.In September last year, delegates at Labour\u0027s UK conference had overwhelmingly backed keeping the option of a fresh ballot on the table.But it was only last month, after Labour\u0027s alternative Brexit proposals were rejected by MPs, that the party leadership spoke out in favour of a second European referendum.Ms Laird said: That path is not smooth. Right now there is no parliamentary majority for this.Ultimately no matter what outcome we want to achieve, if we can not get the numbers we will not win the vote.But we cannot give up. We must keep fighting. We must reject Theresa May\u0027s shoddy deal and we must get no deal off the table.Great Grimsby\u0027s Labour MP Melanie Onn met Theresa May after her speech but said the PM needed to move closer to the opposition\u0027s position.She must be aware that if she needs to get the deal through and the backstop arrangements are insufficient to secure the support from her back benches, there will need to be movement towards securing more support from Labour members, she told BBC Radio 4\u0027s World At One.Asked if she could back the deal, the shadow housing minister said: As it stands, no. Nothing has changed from when she brought it forward in January.Reaction is starting to come in to May\u0027s speech and safe to say she hasn\u0027t won over her critics.A Labour source texts: “Is that it? What a waste of everyone\u0027s time.“There was nothing new in the speech, just more time wasting and running down the clock.She really is in trouble.SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: Theresa May must stop passing the buck and take personal responsibility for the Brexit crisis created as a result of her own intransigence.The Tory leader\u0027s damaging Brexit deal is fundamentally flawed and would be devastating for Scotland - inflicting lasting harm on jobs, living standards, our public services and the economy.\u0026nbspWith three weeks to go until the UK is due to crash out of the EU, it is vital that MPs reject May\u0027s bad deal, extend Article 50, and hold a second referendum on EU membership.Labour\u0027s Jo Stevens, who supports the Best for Britain campaign,\u0026nbspsaid:\u0026nbspIt smacks of complete hypocrisy to hear the Prime Minister saying the EU’s behaviour will determine the outcome of next week’s vote.“She and her government are the only people responsible for this whole debacle. Their botched deal and tactic of running down the clock to scare people with a no deal disaster will be judged by future generations.If Theresa May is really interested in getting this right, there\u0027s an easy solution: ask the public what they want.Please allow a moment for the liveblog\u0026nbspto loadWe’ll tell you what’s true.

But given parliament looks set to extend Article 50, there’ll be further opportunities to secure support for Labour’s alternative Brexit deal.“This would bring the country together and defend jobs, rights and our security.”Labour’s David Lammy, a supporter of the anti-Brexit group Best for Britain, said: “It’s become clear today that there is no majority in the house for May’s deal, but also that Labour’s alternative plan cannot command a majority either.“In the key votes ahead of us we must extend Article 50 to take a catastrophic no deal off the table and use that time to put this decision back to the people to decide if they back the government’s botched Brexit deal or staying in our current EU deal.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

He said the UK had made no offer and should change its approach.Ms May has been unable to get the deal she negotiated through parliament because of concerns about it from all sides. She wants the EU to change aspects of the withdrawal agreement to make it more palatable to hard Brexiteers within her party.But speaking in Dublin the taoiseach\u0026nbspsaid the withdrawal agreement as it stood was “already a compromise” that had taken a year and a half to negotiate.“We’ve already agreed to a review clause so I think we have made a lot of compromises and what’s not evident is what the UK government is offering the EU and Ireland should they wish us to make any further compromises, we receive no offer as to what they would give us in return for any changes,” he said.Belgium tells companies to halt exports to UK after Brexit“It would require a change of approach by the UK government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their creation, what was agreed is already a compromise. They failed to secure ratification of this so it should be a question of what they are willing to offer us.”EU leaders have previously suggested the\u0026nbspgovernment should soften Brexit by renegotiating the future relationship, in order to gain Labour votes to pass the plan. Theresa May has rejected this approach – which would be likely to enrage hard Brexiteers in her party.The prime minister wants legally binding changes to water down the Irish border backstop. Her negotiators, who have been shuttling between Brussels and London all week, have reportedly proposed a new system that could end the backstop early if both sides do not endeavour to replace it with new arrangements.\u0026nbspMs May herself gave a speech in Grimsby on Friday afternoon, calling for “one more push” from the EU to get her deal over the line. The same day, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said people would blame the EU if it\u0026nbspdid not make concessions for the UK.\u0026nbspEU diplomats willing to comment on the talks have spoken of their frustration with the UK’s approach.“We are expecting a blame game after she loses the second ‘meaningful vote’ next week, so it looks like she is already preparing the ground for this,” one EU diplomat said.Meanwhile Mr Varadkar’s deputy Simon Coveney warned the prime minister not to listen to hard Brexiteers in her party.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.French gendarmes arrive for evacuation as prison guards block the entrance to the penitentiary center of Alencon, in Conde-sur-Sarthe, northwestern France, two days after a prison inmate seriously wounded two guards in a knife attack before being detained in a police raid. - The prison of Alencon  Conde-sur-Sarthe, where two guards were seriously stabbed on March 5 by a radicalized detainee, was blocked again on March 7 by about a hundred prison guards.

But we are still asking the SMEs and all other parties to wait. Do the necessary export to your customers before 29 March,” he told Belgian business newspaper De Tijd.Mr Vanderwaeren said larger industries “such as pharmaceutical companies and car manufacturers” had been “storing stock in the UK for months” to avoid having to get parts through after Brexit but that the vast majority of businesses were not well prepared with just weeks to go.Belgium’s main port of Zeebrugge is expected to have to deal with around a million additional import declarations and 4.5 million extra export declarations once the UK leaves the single market and customs union.Huge queues for Eurostar passengers after no-deal border checks trialThe warning follows chaos and hours of delays at Calais and the Eurostar terminal in Paris after French customs officers carried out a trial of the sort of checks they would have to impose under a no-deal Brexit.The customs chief also warned that many small businesses that dealt with the UK were simply not prepared to export and that it would be better for them to pause operations.“Our customs authority has written letters to some 20,000 companies that trade with the UK telling them they have to apply for an EORI number, which is necessary to be able to import and export,” Mr\u0026nbspVanderwaeren told the newspaper.“But today, three weeks before the Brexit, customs received only 4,700 positive answers. Customs has even set up a call centre that answers questions and calls companies to get them to register for customs licences.”France, the Netherlands\u0026nbspand Belgium have all hired hundreds of extra customs officers to deal with the potential disruption caused by the UK’s decision.Unless Article 50 is extended or revoked, Britain is set to leave on 29 March. If Theresa May’s Brexit deal is approved by MPs, the UK will enter a transition period and little will change immediately – but there are few signs the government has the numbers in the House of Commons to get it approved.If there is no extension of revocation and no transition period, the UK will crash out and the expected chaos at ports and airports will materialise.Created with Sketch.

The only other time it has been evoked by the British government was during a bitter dispute over the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian oil Company by Iran in the 1950s in a chain of events which ended with the overthrow of a progressive democratically elected government by Britain and the US.Created with Sketch.Revolution in Iran: in pictures Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A demonstration against the Shah in 1979Armed women on guard in one of the main squares in Tehran at the beginning of the Iranian RevolutionDemonstrators hold a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, in January 1979, in Tehran, during a demonstration against the ShahIranian rebels pose with a U.S. flag they bayonetted upside down on trees at Sultanabad Garrison northeast of Tehran on February 12 2019A gun battle in Khorramshahr during the revolution, 1979Ayatollah Khomeini\u0027s supporters demonstrate in the streets of Tehran against the Shah among tear gas.

Irrespective of UK residency, Ms Zaghari thus remains Iranian.”The ambassador, who is not regarded as a hardliner, was restating the Iranian government’s position on dual nationality and his message is being seen by diplomats as measured and non-aggressive.But there are rising internal tensions in Iran. Donald Trump’s jettisoning of Iran’s nuclear agreement with international powers, and re-imposition of sanctions, has led to severe economic problems in the country, strengthening the hands of the conservatives who have long opposed the deal.Iran foreign minister Zarif back at work after withdrawing resignationThe isions led to the temporary resignation of the Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, who was the chief architect of the deal from the Iranian side. He has since stayed in his post for the time being, after President Rouhani refused to accept his resignation.British officials have privately stressed that there had been no liaison with the Rouhani government before the announcement of diplomatic protection. The decision was taken, Mr Hunt said, to demonstrate “to the whole world that Nazanin is innocent and the UK will not stand by when one of its citizens is treated so unjustly.”Diplomatic protection raises Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s situation from a consular to a state-to-state issue and also opens the door for legal action, with the possibility of compensation if it is proved that she has been mistreated.Any case would be dealt with by the International Court of Justice in the Hague. But senior British officials wanted to stress that there is no desire to go down the legal route for the time being.“We are puzzled as to why this is being done, at this time. The UK knows that there are people in Iran in responsible positions who have been trying hard to resolve this matter. Jeremy Hunt has said this himself to a lot of people, we know,” said an advisor to the Rouhani government.Mossadeq, pictured in 1951 (Getty Images)“It is difficult to know what this will achieve in trying to get her released. But we know that some people (hardliners) are saying this is an attempt at outside interference which must be resisted. The tactic the British are using has bad colonial meaning, especially in Iran - this is unfortunate.”Diplomatic protection was exercised by Britain for employees of the Anglo-Iranian oil company after it became the Anglo-Persian Oil Company – which later became British Petroleum and then BP – and was nationalised by the Iranian government of Mohammed Mossadeq. The government in London took the measure after failing in a case disputing the nationalisation at the International Court in The Hague.Mr Mossadeq, democratically elected, was subsequently overthrown by a coup organised by MI6 and CIA, codenamed Operation Ajax. Many of his supporters were tortured and his closest associate, the Foreign Minister Hossein Fatemi, was executed by a military court of the Shah of Iran whose position had been strengthened by London and Washington.In December 1953, Mr Mossadeq was sentenced to three years solitary confinement by a military court, which rejected the death sentence sought by prosecutors, supposedly at the instigation of the Shah and his Western advisors. The former prime minister was, however, kept under house arrest until his death in 1967.Mr Mossadeq’s funeral was forbidden by the Shah’s regime and he was buried at his home. He had wished to be laid to rest in a public cemetery among victims of political violence and state oppression.We’ll tell you what’s true.

I know, I know. It really could go either way, that one, couldn’t it  You might end up looking as toned as Joe Wicks — or more like Piers Morgan with an industrial air compressor up his rear.Fortunately, ITV and its diet expert Michael Mosley had gathered “six famous guinea pigs” to gorge themselves stupid and settle this debate for good: Nadine, Hayley Tamaddon off Coronation Street, Peter Andre, Made In Cha’s Hugo Taylor, “Chaser” Shaun Wallace and Tessa Sanderson, who all brought their own degree of hype and range of medical quirks to the experiment.Hayley, for instance, has irritable bowel syndrome, while Hugo suffers from a debilitating strain of irritable personality syndrome and is prone to quoting the Dalai Lama or grandly announcing: “I’m trying to do this for other people. It’s kind of, like, a selfless act.” Or it was, until Hugo decided he couldn’t be arsed and pulled out of the experiment at the end of Week One.The other five kept eating, eating, eating, though, until their bodies began to groan, fart and generally give up on their owners. Hayley and Tessa both had to be withdrawn from the process on health grounds, Shaun Wallace developed sleep apnoea and Nadine began passing “rubber pellets”.One other thing also became apparent during the opening few days of The Junk Food Experiment. Their innards could’ve been begging for mercy and Nadine might well have been on the verge of crapping a cc song, but they all looked exactly the same.It was no sort of spectacle at all, so they tried perking it up with all sorts of production stunts. Peter Andre went for a brain scan that revealed it’s  per cent McFlurry, Michael Mosley entered a competitive eating challenge and Shaun Wallace was sent to his local pub quiz, where he misidentied “the unwanted, loud screeching sounds you sometimes hear from a microphone or speaker” as “white noise” rather than the correct answer, Little Mix.On Day , Nadine also went for another dump — and I don’t know what she was thinking while she sat there, but my mind was wandering to the fact it’s now  years since ITV axed World In Action, a show that was sold around the world and conducted the investigation leading to the release of the Birmingham Six.Here we are now, two decades later, watching six self-publicists come to the the “no-s***, Sherlock” conclusion of the century — eating nothing but pizzas and fast food is bad for you.With the most damning fact of all being that ITV, at the very least, is sending mixed messages about the obesity crisis on its network Hub, where I watched The Junk Food Experiment and every other show received the same promo message.“Sponsored by Domino’s — the official food of unmissable entertainment.”Thanks for your concern, though, ITV.

What continues to stop it being the most pointless exercise in TV history, though, is the narrator Rob Beckett, who’s fantastically dismissive about everyone and everything involved with Celebs Go Dating.So when David finally reveals “I’m a club rep”, he mutters: “I was thinking either that or a jockey,” and when Kerry reminds yet another person, “I used to be in a girlband,” Rob adds: “Before realising her dream of flogging frozen prawn rings.”In the brutal and relentless process, he’s somehow turned this epic non-event into one of television’s funniest shows, and I just wish the industry could come up with a better reward for him than All Together Now.The Real Marigold On Tour, Paul Nicholas: “There is humour in everything.” See Martin Clunes’ sitcom Warren for proof there really isn’t.BEST news of the TV week is that Channel ’s admirably un-PC The Bachelor has ed to our screens after a seven-year hiatus.Prize this time is a civilian called Alex, who was “bullied at school” , found salvation in the gym and now spends his days running along beaches, like a right dobber.

I mean who, in their imaginations, wants to eliminate the human race It is worth looking at some data. Many of the kids, led by Greta herself, argue that governments are “doing nothing” to reduce carbon emissions.  Not that they are failing to do enough – which is a legitimate argument – but that they are doing nothing.Yet figures published on Monday show an astounding decline in Britain’s CO₂ output. According to statistics released by Carbon Brief,  saw the sixth consecutive fall in the carbon pumped by Britain into the atmosphereTotal emissions are down by  per cent since , a record unmatched by any other major country. With the exception of , the year of the General Strike, you have to go back to  to find a lower level of carbon output.Given the rise in our population in the meantime, that figure is even more impressive. In per capita terms, we have now reduced CO₂ emissions to the level of .You can of course argue that there is still more to do. But “doing nothing”  Seriously  Yet that is indeed the claim being made by eco-activists. They are asserting that governments, including ours, are deliberately wasting time for some reason that no one ever quite explains, but that vaguely has to do with “putting profits before people”.Listen to the way in which the London marchers explained their behaviour in a video put out by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One after another, the young people claimed that they were protesting against people who were quite happy to wreck Planet Earth.“The government doesn’t really care about our future,” said the first demonstrator. “They’re just trying to waste time,” said the second. “I really care about it, because it’s gonna be my kids who wake up and the world’s in pieces,” said the third. “We’re the ones who have to live here,” said the fourth.And where do you suppose the rest of us will be living  I mean, I get that it is tempting to demonise your opponents, but not wanting their own kids to survive  That’s not exactly setting the bar high, is it To be fair, most of us see the world in black-and-white when we’re in our teens. Think back to what you used to read or watch at that age. Young adult literature doesn’t really go in for shades of grey, does it  J.K Rowling doesn’t try to explain what makes the Malfoys nasty. Their nastiness is a given.Some youngsters extend their Harry Potter view of the world into politics, ing the world, not into Leftists and Rightists, but into goodies and baddies. Why would someone want to poison the seas or burn the rainforests  Because – weren’t you listening  – they’re baddies.Most of us eventually learn that le is more complicated than that. For example, Britain has seen huge reductions in its CO₂ emissions because, under Margaret Thatcher, it stopped subsidising unprofitable coalmines. At that time, the sort of people who now march against climate change were marching against the closures.The reason that the United Statesis also seeing a sharp fall in its carbon output is that it is has taken up large-scale fracking – again, a technology that many of the marchers hate.But rehearsing these arguments means acknowledging that things aren’t always simple. It means understanding that there is a trade-off between opportunities for deprived communities and carbon output. It means grasping that most carbon emissions come from China and India. It means recognising the contradiction between “mining coal good” and “burning coal bad”.Most of the marchers will come to understand these things. But some will carry on telling themselves that people who disagree with them are, like the Malfoys, just evil. A few will never grow out of their teen certainties at all.

If Theresa May were to win such a vote for a second time then there is no ­obligation for the Government to follow mere motions of the Commons.Similarly, ­ministers who cannot support Government policy are entitled to leave the Government, as the honourable recent example of George Eustice shows.Naturally, the Government must prove that it is committed to the referendum result, for that is the authoritative ­constitutional voice.No responsible government ought to allow the constitution to be subverted because of its own weaknesses. The ­conventions are there for good ­reasons and,ignored, confidence in the system that has served well for ­centuries will be damaged — with ­consequences that could include the rise of extremist parties. Failure to deliver Brexit would be a gt to Tommy Robinson.Fortunately, it is in the power of the Government, and especially of Mrs May, to deliver Brexit.  Votes in the House of Commons cannot override the law.If they could we would have arbitrary government and the law says we leave at the end of this month.The Prime Minister could simply refuse to ask for an extension or to move the ­Statutory Instrument that is needed to change the date. Mrs May may choose to fulfil or to break her promises to the electorate and will be held to account accordingly.Eurosceptics must similarly be guided by the electorate — it is our duty and obligation to those who trusted that the vote in  would be decisive and would be implemented.This makes it necessary to vote against the current deal as well as efforts to move the date beyond March .The people have spoken.

All forbidden under the new rules.The Farmdrop episode is an early sign that there is more to the crackdown on so-called “junk food” than we have been led to believe.Last year, the Government proposed a ban on junk food adverts on television before pm, a ban on junk food being displayed at the entrance of shops or at the end of supermarket aisles, and a ban on junk food being sold at a discount.But junk food has no legal definition. It is a pejorative term used by campaigners such as chef Jamie Oliver to push their nanny state agenda.In practice, the legislation will apply to all food or drink considered to be high in fat, salt or sugar— and that includes the kind of food your grandmother would have approved of, such as butter and jam.The official definition of HFSS was drawn up over a decade ago, when Tony Blair banned junk food advertising on children’s television.A system was devised in which food products were given a mark out of , with points added for “negative” nutrients — such as saturated fat, sugar and sodium — and points subtracted for “positive” nutrients such as fruit, vegetables, protein and fibre.Calories are also counted as negative nutrients. If a food gets more than four points, it is classed as HFSS and cannot be advertised on children’s TV.The system was never intended to be a measure of “junk food” or “unhealthy food”. It was only supposed to distinguish “less healthy” food from “more healthy” food for the purposes of encouraging children to eat better.Nevertheless, the system has since been adopted by the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, for his ban on junk food advertising on public transport.It could also soon be used to decide which products can be advertised before pm, which products can be included in discount deals and which products can be displayed in prominent areas of shops.In reality, the system sets the bar for “healthy food” so high that it condemns hundreds of everyday products as junk.Nearly all bacon, burgers, sweets, crisps, desserts and biscuits fail the test, but other products classied as HFSS include ketchup, mayonnaise , jam, honey, Marmite, soy sauce, mustard, gravy, stock cubes, butter and olive oil.I have never met anyone who thinks that raisins, sultanas, hummus, walnuts, pesto, olive bread, dressed salads and tomato soup are unhealthy, yet all would be covered by the Government’s proposed bans.So too would dried fruit, cereal bars, margarine, most tinned fruit, most yoghurts, nearly all cheese , many pasta sauces and one in four sandwiches.Asthis system were not puritanical enough, Public Health England is in the process of making it even harder for food and drink to be classed as “more healthy”.A new version will soon come into effect that will classy all yoghurt drinks, a quarter of pasta brands, a quarter of noodle brands, most high-fibre breakfast cereals,  per cent of coffee and  per cent of fruit juice and smoothies as HFSS.This will leave the Government in the absurd position of officially advising people to drink pure orange juice as one of their five a day while banning adverts for it because it is junk.Some snacks Public Health England recommends as part of its £.million ChangeLe campaign will be classied as HFSS, as will most of the soft drinks that have been reformulated with less sugar.Under pressure from the Government, and to the fury of many loyal customers, brands such as Irn-Bru and Lucozade have had their sugar content cut dramatically, and yet they will face severe restrictions on price and promotion under the Government’s plans.Looking at the range of food and drink products that are classied as HFSS, it becomes clear that what is being proposed is not so much a crackdown on junk food as a crackdown on food in general, with exemptions for raw ingredients and health food.Politicians and the public have been sold a pig in a poke by those who campaign against the meaningless category of “junk food”.When askedthey agree with a ban on junk food adverts that are targeted at children, most people say they do, but that is not what is being proposed.If they were asked whether they would support a ban on olive oil being advertised during the Channel  News, they might take a dferent view.We are sleep-walking into legislation that is far more extensive than most of us realise.Hysterical claims about junk food have been used as cover for tobacco-style regulation being rolled out across the food supply.The nation’s biggest and most important industry could soon be banned from advertising most of its products during daytime television, costing broadcasters tens of millions of pounds and lowering the quality of programming.The ban on HFSS products being positioned at the entrance, checkout and end of aisle will cause shopkeepers all kinds of headaches, and the ban on discounts, such as buy-one-get-one-free, could cost consumers hundreds of pounds a year.Surely a rethink is in order Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour’s Naz Shah was asking for the chance of a debate about Islamophobia.Ms Leadsom said she should “discuss a way forward with the Foreign Office”.Ms Shah said it “horrically alludes to British Muslims as foreigners”.A spokeswoman for the Commons Leader insisted Ms Leadsom thought the Labour MP was referring to a global definition of Islamaphobia.The spokeswoman said: Islamophobia is unacceptable wherever it takes place.It was thought the MP for Bradford West was referring to a global definition of Islamophobia. International efforts to combat Islamophobiaare lead by the PMs special envoy on freedom of religion or belief, Lord Ahmad, at the Foreign  Commonwealth Office.Of course, any form of Islamophobia in the UK would be dealt with swtly by the Home Office or Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government as appropriate.Labour said Karen Bradley should quit – as she no longer had the credibility to stay on as Northern Ireland Secretary.In September she admitted she hadn’t appreciated the sectarian voting patterns in the province.Ms Bradley said she was “profoundly sorry” as relatives of victims killed by the military demanded she go. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It belongs to the people who voted for it and want to see it implemented so we can all move on to a prosperous future.And that more prosperous future also belongs to those who voted against Brexit and who expect politicians to make reasonable compromises to bring our country back together.The Prime Minister also took aim at the EU and warned Brussels will have to take its share of responsibilityher efforts fail.She said: “Just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the EU has to make a choice too.“We are both participants in this process. It is in the European interest for the UK to leave with a deal.“We are working with them but the decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote.”Mrs May insisted that it needs just one more push to address the final, specic concerns of our Parliament.Blasting the possibility of a delay which would prolong the uncertainty, she said: That might lead to a form of Brexit that does not match up to what people voted for.And a delay could lead to something  – a second Brexit referendum. The chances of that have increased since Jeremy Corbyn said he would back one.The PM said staying in the EU would be a political failure which lets down the .million people who voted to back Brexit .She added: My message to those MPs who agree with me that we should not risk that is simple - the only certain way to avoid it is to back the deal the Government has secured with EU on Tuesday.Repeating the phrase lets get it done, Mrs May concluded: The British people have moved on, they want us to get it done. What people want is for us to do this and do it now.MPs will vote on whether or not to approve the deal on Tuesday, after rejecting it first time round in January.If they defeat the deal they will then have the choice between a No Deal Brexit on March , or a delay to the Article  process taking us out of the EU.Attorney General Geoffrey Cox has been in Brussels this week trying to secure a fix to the deal which can win over enough Tory MPs in next weeks vote.But he came away empty-handed as the EU played hardball - raising the possibility of a second humiliating Commons defeat.Labour MP Margaret Beckett, a backer of the Peoples Vote campaign, said today: The Brexit process has become a national humiliation and nowhere is this clearer than in position of the Prime Minister herself.“Today she has been left as a supplicant to the EU, begging them to reverse and revise an agreement of which she herself was the principal author and which she hailed as a triumph for her diplomacy only a matter of weeks ago."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/NINTCHDBPICT000474036674.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eu brexit deal michel barnier backstop","story":"Eurocrat Michel Barnier tabled an offer that would allow Britain to quit the customs union rather than being trapped in the backstop.But the plan would see Northern Ireland staying tied to the EU - effectively creating a border inside the United Kingdom.The offer is almost identical to a proposal which was rejected by Theresa May months ago.She has also consistently said one of her major priorities remains keeping the UK intact and she would never consider a deal that would split it apart.Critics claimed the move proved the EU isnt serious about helping the PM get her deal across the line next week.Mrs Mays officials have been locked in talks with Brussels ever since the deal was voted down by MPs in January.Brexiteers have warned they wont back the withdrawal agreement unless the backstop, which keeps the UK in the customs union to avoid a hard border in Ireland, is fixed.Mr Barnier, the EUs chief Brexit envoy, said today that he had offered legally binding changes to the PMs team.One part of the offer would give more force to existing proposals which let us leave the backstopfuture trade talks break down.But the other would see Great Britain quit the customs union while Northern Ireland stays in, keeping the border open while creating a new border in the Irish Sea.The idea of a Northern Ireland-only backstop was already shot down by Mrs May in talks last year.Mr Barnier tweeted: UK will not be forced into customs union against its will.The EU will continue working intensively over the coming days to ensure that the UK leaves the EU with an agreement.But furious Brexiteers hit back - David Davis ex-chief of staff Stewart Jackson raged: The EU are still playing games.The DUP also rejected the idea because it would not respect the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK.Even pro-Remain MPs were annoyed - Scottish Tory Paul Masterton said: An exclusively NI backstop would be far more unacceptable.

I’m pleased that rather than trying to justy its use, you moved quickly to apologise and spoke of being “mortied” you said it. No doubt your team are keen to draw a line under things and move on. But many aren’t as keen to quickly sweep it under the carpet and pretend nothing has happened. As someone who was once married to a prominent journalist, you of all people should know the power of words. It worries me a Cabinet Minister - one who was previously in charge of a Home Office that was presided over the Windrush scandal which saw Caribbeans wrong deported and denied legal rights - can so casually bandy around a term like coloured.   I cringed when I heard you say it in your BBC interview with Jeremy Vine. It’s the kind of language you might expect to hear from a great-grandad who doesn’t know any better. And it makes me think,you can use that word publicly, without skipping a beat, what kind of language do you use in private  In making your wider point, ironically in defence of Diane, you said it was awful that “black and minority ethnic people suffer in this way”. You know what, I feel using terms like “minority ethnic” to describe people are just as isive. They have become an acceptable way of reminding people that they are dferent, not the norm and by extension less than what is considered the mainstream.  BAME and BME are politically correct acronyms that sprung up in recent years to allow politicians, squeamish about using the word black, to have a get out of jail free card. But can you tell me what it actually means  Is it Black and Minority Ethnic  If so, where do Asian people fit into this description. Or is it Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic. In this case, who are the minority ethnic people that we are constantly trying to point to as being dferent  You come from the party of Anne Marie Morris, the Conservative MP who in  used the N-word in during a discussion about Brexit and Boris Johnson who has referred to black people as “piccaninnies” and having “watermelon smiles”. As I heard someone say on the radio, this has to be a “teachable moment”. It can’t simply be yesterday’s news.

The Brussels chief negotiator took the unprecedented step of publicly tweeting his plan for a compromise on the Irish backstop. Theresa May has for weeks being trying to rework the backstop - a clause in the -page Brexit deal that could trap the UK under EU customs rules. She wanted either a way to quit the backstop, a time limit, or alternative arrangements to replace it. Tonight Mr Barnier said the EU would commit to letting the UK exit the backstop - but only one part of it, a shared customs union with the EU. That means the other provisions would have to stay - a move critics say will ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK.  A DUP source tonight said they would not back any deal which saw a customs border established in the Irish Sea. Weve been clear from the very start, anything which would see Northern Ireland treated separately from the UK will not get our support and we will be reiterating that to the PM A Tory Brexiteer told the Financial Times: Do they think we are stupid  Tory MP Paul Masterson tweeted: An exclusively NI backstop would be far more unacceptable. Round in circles we go.   And its something the current draft enables anyway . So we now have the EU presenting old solutions it knows we wont accept, which is exactly what its been criticising UK for doing. Askedthey had any reaction to the EUs offer, a Brexiteer source said: Not really. They’re laughable. We laugh at them. Mr Barnier issued the ultimatum as he slammed the blame game just hours after Theresa May appeared to blame the EU in a major speech. Mrs May urged EU leaders to make just one more push and her Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned them not to inject poison into the UK-EU relationship. But Mr Barnier told reporters in Brussels: The EU stands united. We are not interested in the blame game. We are still working.  It came as Theresa May attempted to pin the blame for the Brexit chaos on the EU, Jeremy Corbyn and anyone  except herself. The Prime Minister warned wavering MPs the UK could stay in the EUthey rejected her deal again on Tuesday. She told workers in Grimsby: “If MPs reject the deal, nothing is certain. It would be at a moment of crisis. “MPs would immediately be faced with another choice - either we leave the EU with no deal on March  or we delay Brexit and carry on arguing about it.” But despite warning that no-deal would fire consequences she refused to say she would whip her MPs to vote against ither deal fails to pass. Despite weeks of heated negotiations Mrs May did not reveal any substantial changes to the Irish backstop. Speaking directly to EU leaders she urged hem to back the changes she needs to appease the DUP and her own back bench MPs. “My message to them is: now is the moment for us to act,” she said. Instead I’m the face of a second historic defeat she said attempted to pay the blame the deal’s likely failure on Jeremy Corbyn. She said that the Labour leader was “not really interested in finding a solution” - instead accusing him of trying to stop Brexit happening. She added: “I have repeatedly offered him another meeting to follow it up. “In , after multiple requests from my office, he has offered just one hour over the last five weeks when our teams could meet. “And we now know why. “Because despite his promise at the last election to deliver Brexit, he now supports holding a isive second referendum that would take the UK right back to square one. “If we go down that road, we might never leave the EU at all.” "},{"url":null,"title":"international womens day think women","story":"NewsopinionOn International Womens Day, think about the women you dont hear fromWe hear from men all the time.

When Karen Bradley first says that British soldiers who shot unarmed civilians were following orders, then that she doesnt think that, and finally that she doesnt even believe herself, an observer from out of space could be forgiven for thinking that,she was the best person we could find to juggle with highly-explosive Northern Irish sensitivities, the whole species is heading for the blender.Were you to inform E.T. that Andrea Leadsom thinks British Muslims are the concern of the Foreign Office and Amber Rudd implies darker-skinned people are that way because of marker pens, hed be on his spaceship and getting to a safe distance before you could add that Katie Prices highly-monetised balloon boobs have somehow landed her poundm in debt.Butyou despair of the quality of womanhood in general, you are forgetting something. Because just as they have throughout human history, the women who grab our attention do so because when theres something wrong with them. Rudd is stuck in the s, Leadsom is so th century she lacks only a crinoline and marriageable daughters, and Bradley, plainly, is a malware-infected bot.Theresa May is in the news not because shes spent  years holding her self-immolating party together and dealing with the most dficult political crisis of our letimes, but because men arent happy with how shes doing it. Hillary Clinton is a prominent failure, rather than a ceiling-smashing lawyer who came within a whisker of the White House and was considered such a threat by the men of Russia and Wikileaks that they conspired against her personally with a man who lived in a golden phallus. Oprah Winfrey is fat. Ivanka Trump says stupid things. Angela Merkel isnt much of a looker. Name me ONE GUY about whom you could say all that. But the fact womanhood is a mixed-ability class is not in itself reason to despair. Masculinity has its fair share of fat, stupid, ugly people who do things wrong all the time, and unlike women they rarely apologise for it.Trump expressed no regret for employing criminals, praising Nazis or groping women. Putin murders his critics rather than listen to them. Kim Jong-Un never worries about the size of his cheese-saturated, un-fatshamed bum.We hear from men all the time. We hear from prominent women, too, about apologies, hopes, and good ideas that, very shortly, a man will re-announce like it was his all along. We do not hear from the others.  If human beings were left to procreate naturally, the world would be about % female. Instead its .%.Thats million women. Missing, presumed dead.They are missing because they were aborted for not being boys, killed after birth for the same reason, denied health care, refused education, raped, murdered, brutalised, and left to die from disease and malnutrition. They include Jodie Chesney, stabbed to death on a park bench aged  in an apparently motiveless attack, as well as females who die in childbirth, women killed for the concept of male honour, and teens in cars crashed at speed by men to prove their masculinity. Then there are invisible women who survived long enough to live unnoticed in slums, refugee camps, mud huts, multi-occupancy housing, brothels, massage parlours, prisons and in ordinary streets behind ordinary doors where it is perfectly ordinary for them to suffer and die. Those with better luck get to go to school, except when they have periods and they stay at home. They get to have jobs, so long as they dont ask for too much money and dont mind getting laid off before men. They get to fall in love, so long as they dont complain too much when he mistreats her. And in many countries they get to enjoy all of that for longer and die a little later. The country I live in is better to women than most. Women text to let their mums know they got home without being raped, those who use their legal rights to get better treatment are considered unemployable or unmarriageable, and girls are bullied into sending naked pictures to boys who share them with their friends. Vaginas are stretchy, guys, but not THAT stretchy.Females here are told they dress wrong, think wrong, talk wrong, interrupt wrong, and work wrong. About all a female can be guaranteed to get praised for is dancing in her knickers, a fact which makes me want to stowaway on the first space ship that lingers too long over its crop circle. But dealing with all that for centuries has done something rather brilliant.In much the same way as the women who survive infancy can expect to live longer than men, it has bred a super-race. Women who run countries, corporations, and the international economy as easily as they can run a tap. And millions more who run their homes and lives just as well, but a lot more quietly.For years the only women who succeeded were superior beings, and in their wake have come more who learned by example. Those who tried to have it all, and mostly managed it, have been replaced by women for whom the definition of all has expanded like the Kardashian empire, which turned one instance of sexual exploitation into a billion-dollar female powerhouse.So successful have women been that those born with male genitalia now wish to be reclassied as female. Put aside whatever thoughts you have on the social, physical or cultural acceptability of that - for the first time humans are campaigning NOT to be men.We should be delighted that a woman in Karen Bradleys position is such a remarkable idiot. It at least proves that were used to brilliant women. If we are noticing women who arent up to the standards we expect of frontline troops, it proves women have set a high standard. We are now arguing about a woman presenter on Question Time, a pregnant princess with opinions, pink power tools and period poverty. When I was growing up not a single one of those things existed in the national consciousness or had any hope of doing so.Even better, we are noticing the women who have never been noticed before. The superwomen will have to fix that problem, too, because the guys sure havent got very far. The presence of a few idiots does not mean womanhood is regressing. It means more of us really do enjoy equal opportunities, oies arent holding so many people back, and were judging women on their ability rather than their knickers. Besides, being a moron never stopped a man. Stop the spaceship, I want to get off. Theres work to do.

It came during a meeting with families bereaved by security force violence who wanted to express concern about her controversial comments on state killings. Mrs Bradley was handed a number of pictures of the Stephen McConomy who was shot and killed by a plastic bullet close to his home in Derry  Londonderry in . The MP was said to be left speechless at the images him wearing his school unorm two weeks before he was killed and of the boy on a le support machine. The Northern Ireland Secretary reached out to a number of victims groups on a visit to Belfast after she said killings carried out by the police and military during the Troubles were not crimes, rather actions of people fulfilling their duties in a dignied and appropriate way.  Her comments sparked fury among victims and she was forced to backtrack and apologise saying on Thursday: I want to be very clear - I do not believe what I said, that is not my view. The remarks were especially ill-judged coming a week before long-awaited decisions from Northern Ireland prosecutors on whether  soldiers involved in the Bloody Sunday shootings in Derry Londonderry in  will face prosecution. Relatives of those killed in shootings involving the Army in Ballymurphy in west Belfast in  refused to meet the Conservative MP today.   The families, who say they have been requesting a meeting with the minister for some time to no avail, dismissed her apology.John Teggart, whose father Danny was shot  times at Ballymurphy, said Mrs Bradley should resign. We will not meet her, and have one request for Mrs Bradley and that is for her to resign immediately, he said.   But members of the group Relatives for Justice did meet Mrs Bradley so they could tell her how her comments had made them feel. Speaking after the meeting, Frances Meehan, whose brother was shot dead by the British Army in , called for Mrs Bradley to resign. I wanted to meet her because I wanted to look her in the eye to tell her how I felt about her comments in the House of Commons, she said. I also wanted to say to her that on this day, International Womens Day, that she is an insult to women. We know she has apologised but her position is completely and utterly untenable and she needs to resign. Mrs Bradley rowed back on her comments on Thursday as she battled to keep her job. She said: I want to be very clear - I do not believe what I said, that is not my view. I believe that where crimes have happened, no matter who the perpetrator, they should be properly investigated by an independent authority and they should be prosecuted.

The Duchess of Sussex, wearing a pound Azzura black and white mini dress from Reiss, said shed seen a Netflix documentary about feminism where shed heard the expression. She said: I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case. Meghan has joined a  of female thought leaders at Kings College London brought together by The Queens Commonwealth Trust - of which she has today become vice-president. Meghan, talking about a range of issues that affect women, has said that from the young age of  she knew she wanted to do something about inequality and sexism. The Duchess has also spoken of the importance of access to education for young girls, arguing it really does solve so many of the world’s problems. She talked about how vital it is to de-stigmatise menstruation in communities, saying its  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. And Meghan said its important for men to understand they can be feminists as well and be part of the conversation, adding my husband certainly is. The -year-old also revealed during the discussion that she does not look at Twitter, saying: I don’t look at it. Sorry no. For me that is my personal preference. Those joining the Duchess for the chat include Annie Lennox and former prime minister of Australia Julia Gillard.  Meghan has been described by the s host as a royal not afraid to embrace full-on feminism. Asked how her pregnancy was going, she said: Very well. Its funny, Id actually been joking these past few weeks Id seen this documentary on Netflix about feminism and one of the things they said during pregnancy was I feel the embryonic kicking of feminism. I loved that. So boy or girl, whatever it is, we hope that thats the case.   The group today are talking about the positive opportunities that come when women are given wider access and equal opportunities. Annie Lennox is founder of The Circle, an organisation supporting and empowering womens lives around the world, while Ms Gillard is chairwoman of the Global Institute for Womens Leadership at Kings College London, which is hosting the event. Other members of the  include Adwoa Aboah, who set up the open social discussion  Gurls Talk and Chrisann Jarrett, founder of the equal access to higher education campaign Let Us Learn. Also on the  is Angeline Murimirwa, executive director of the Campaign for Female Education in Africa and co-founder of Cama, a pan-African network of young female leaders. The  is chaired by Anne McElvoy, senior editor of The Economist and columnist with the Evening Standard.   Asked about her own personal journey, Meghan said: “At the age of  I had seen a commercial at the time that I thought to be very sexist. Truth be told, at , I didnt even know what sexism meant. I just knew that something struck me internally that was telling me it was wrong, and I knew that it was wrong. She said she used that as her moral compass, adding: It really set up the trajectory for me to say,there was a wrong,there is a lack of justice, and there is an inequality, then someone needs to do something. And why not me  Once I became old enough to travel, specically to developing countries and see what was happening abroad, I think for me what really resonated was the lack of education for girls, and how that has a ripple effect on so many things, she said today. Meghan added: It really does solve so many of the world’s problems when a girl has access to education. You look at it and you can say, here are the vulnerabilities and the challenges that come about when they don’t have access to education, she continued. Early childhood marriage, susceptibility to trafficking, modern slavery, all of that. But equally look at all the positives that come out of it when you do have access to education for young girls. How it affects the economic development, the GDP. Billions of dollars on the table are lost by girls being pulled out of education.   Meghan spoke about work in India she did a few years ago with a grassroots organisation trying to de-stigmatise menstruation. She said: Giving them access to be able to get these products, but in the same construct having these women mobilised to set up microfinance to sell these pads and other things that are needed to other women in the community. So again it feels like its one issue but it ends up solving so many. Because when you see how many girls are hindered and taken out of school simply because theyre ashamed about going through that transition in le, or because no-one wants to talk to them about it because they dont have what they need and theyre using old rags - literally. Which of course is propelling disease and so many other symptoms that come from this. At the end of the day, we are doing our part just to normalise the conversation. Thats the first step. Because again this is  per cent of the population thats affected by something that can also end up creating the most beautul thing in the world. So its a strange one that its ended up becoming so stigmatised. Remember its also in our own communities that its happening, and the only way we sht that is by talking about it which is why the work you do with Gurls Talk is so important.  Meghan has today become vice-president of the Queens Commonwealth Trust, the organisation has announced. The Duchess has joined her husband Harry, who is president, at the body, while the Queen is its patron. In this new role, the Duchess will highlight the trusts partnerships with young people across the Commonwealth, and in particular its work supporting women and girls, the trust said in a statement. The announcement was made a few hours before the discussion , organised by the Trust, of leading feminists and national figures to mark International Womens Day.

And Emma Bartholomews triumph could open the floodgates to similar cases over inadequate road sign claims at other spots bringing in cash for councils. When Emmas mum was fined by Hackney Council at the confusing bend, she decided to take on the East London local authority.The Hackney Gazette journalist noted it had made more than pound million in the nine months since the cameras had been installed.  She decided to help her mum appeal the ticket after her mum was stung with a fine while she was on her way to perform an act of generosity. Emmas mum had been dropping off clothing donations to St Josephs Hospice in Mare St for its charity jumble sale when she was snapped, she said. Rather than have her mum pay the pound fine, Emma decided it was time to do something about the notorious fine spot. She said her mum had no idea about the camera. An independent adjudicator ultimately agreed with the mother-daugter duo that the signs at the turn from Mare St into Richmond Rd were inadequate.  But Emmas mum risked being slapped with an even bigger fine by taking the council on after it initially rejected their request to overturn the fine. By appealing the pound discount charge, Emmas mum faced it growing to poundshe lost the case. But the tribunal agreed with the pair and overturned Emmas mums fine. Sean Stanton-Dunne of London Tribunals told the Gazette he had come across the case at least five times. He said each time “sent a clear message” to the council the signs in Mare Street were “inadequate.”Allowing the appeal, Mr Stanton-Dunne said: “The no left turn sign is positioned beyond the traffic lights so that it may not be clearly seen before the lights.   The lights are in front of the sign and so risk causing an obstructed view from car level in the left hand lane. “There is an advance warning sign further back from the lights but this is tilted at an angle so that it does not directly face the approaching motorist.” However he does not have the power to force changes. The signs are supposed to warn vehicles they can can no longer turn left into Richmond Road between am and am, and pm and pm, from Monday to Saturday. The change was made last June due to the street outside London Fields Primary School being made a school street in an effort to reduce air pollution. But the stretch has subsequently become a cash cow the local council.   Figures revealed by the Gazette showed Hackney Council was raking in pound, a day from the spot, with almost , people hit by penalty charge noticessince its installation. Just  people, or  per cent of all those issued with a PCN, appealed to the independent adjudicator, where a third won. Just , of the the , notices motorists have tried to appeal in the last nine months have been cancelled. But the council reportedly did not agree with the ruling, with a spokesman telling the Gazette they believe the Department of Transport-approved signs go over and above the requirements for a restriction of this type. A spokesperson added: “Nonetheless we always remain open to making further improvements, and will be inviting an adjudicator to visit Richmond Road so that we can discuss any concerns they may have, and agree how to address them for the benefit of motorists.” But the reporter who took on the council doesnt think her battle ends here. She has pointed out the local authority says the sign adheres to DoT guidelines. She told the Mirror she has no answers yet on whether they will change the signs to make it less confusing. Obviously I think they should, but there doesnt seem to be any authority who can make them do that. Theyve changed the signs once already after some people got hit with more than  tickets when it was first introduced. They obviously havent yet done enough to make the sign visible enough - and the adjudicator agreed with me. Emma pointed outthe scheme is supposed to be for the benefit of the local school:I do wonder why its still in force on a Saturday from am to am and pm to pm, when the school is closed. It does seem to indicate that theyre happy with the situation as it is and the phenomenal amount of money the sign is racking up.

Scott Wilkinson, , was battered to death with a plank of wood by brothers Lenny and Shane Crawt, aged  and  at the time, and their then -year-old cousin Charlie Smith. The Crawt brothers, now  and , were found guilty of murder and Smith, , was found guilty of manslaughter at Guildford Crown Court on March . The -year-old was murdered during a nighttime fishing expedition on Donkey Island, near his home in Walton-on-Thames, Surrey, in July, .   He suffered fatal brain injuries when the three young men brutally assaulted him with a piece of wood. The jury heard how the Crawt brothers and their cousin Smith had been camping on the island. They fled to nearby Grovelands Park after the incident and met a gang of youths they knew. According to Surrey Police, one of the three said: I wouldnt say anythingI was you because we killed someone tonight. Smith told an old school friend that he was on the run for murder.   Detective Inspector Paddy Mayers, who led the investigation, said: This was a vicious and senseless attack on Scott Wilkinson who after the attack was left alone to die. His injuries were so serious that they were not survivable. Shane Crawt, Lenny Crawt and Charlie Smith thought they had got away with it and even boasted about what they had done. They then denied their involvement before blaming each other, putting Scotts family through a distressing trial where they had to listen to graphic detail to what Scott had gone through.   DI Mayers said the trio had never shown any remorse for what they have done. After the verdict, Scotts family shared a heart-wrenching tribute. They said: We have such fond memories of Scott which include him misbehaving with his brother Shaun when they were children much to the consternation of his mother Janet and humorous delight of his father David. Fishing was a family hobby which brought us all together. It created shared experiences during long summer holidays, adventurous trips to Ireland with long drawn out tales of the one that got away. The energy and enthusiasm which Scott directed towards fishing was reflective of his character towards people. He offered friendship, kindness and closeness to those that wanted or needed it. He enriched the lives of the people who knew him. Shane Crawt, from Purley, Lenny, from West Molesey, and Charlie Smith, of no fixed abode will be sentenced at the same court at a later date.

Carla Couperthwaite, , chased the man into the convenience store in Bolton, Greater Manchester, while wielding the kne like a dagger. Stopped from getting in, she then repeatedly stabbed at the door with the serrated blade in a frightening and ferocious attack. She would later claim she did not like the way the man had been looking at her. Couperthwaite, who had been drinking and was frothing at the mouth, spent five minutes trying to get into the Balaton store on Halliwell Road. During the incident, another woman, who was trying to calm her down, managed to get the kne off her, the Manchester Evening News reports. But Couperthwaite then attacked a second man - who was a stranger - after he visibly reacted with alarm when he came across the scene.   She bundled him to the ground and apparently kicked and stamped at him, Bolton Crown Court heard. It is thought the first man was not injured, while a judge said we do not know what damage the defendant did to the second man. Couperthwaite, who has previous convictions for violence, was arrested at her mums home after police were alerted to the incident last month. She later admitted that she had been drinking heavily, and claimed that the way the first man had been looking at her was troubling. She is thought to have got the kne from her home near the scene. Couperthwaite has now been locked up for  months after pleading guilty to two offences - affray, and possessing a bladed article in a public place.  Judge Timothy Stead had adjourned her sentencing so he could examine the blade, saying kne crime in the UK was a concerning national issue. The judge said: The current climate amounts to it being mentioned every time you turn on the television news. The kne which features in this case was brought to court and I actually have it in my chambers. It appears to be a steak kne with a serrated blade. “It appears to be blunted at the end, which is consistent with the defendant’s actions where she stabbed the door with force. Addressing Couperthwaite, he said: You are  years old and you have a y record of offences for somebody your age. Heavy drinking and intoxication seem to be a big part of your le and it featured in this offence.   “You pleaded guilty to two offences, one of affray and one of possessing a bladed article in a public place. He added: The CCTV recording of the incident began with a young male running across the road and running into a shop and he must have locked or barricaded the door from the inside as you were unable to gain entry. “You were chasing after him with one arm raised, holding a kne in your hand like a dagger. It is a steak kne which has been blunted, which is consistent with you stabbing the door with force. “You were effectively launching a frightening and ferocious attack on the door to get to this man. Fortunately there was another woman trying to calm you down and she managed to get the kne off you. “You were described as frothing at the mouth and completely out of control. The judge said the attack on the door was not the end of this offence. “A male stranger was walking along and he visibly reacted with alarm when he saw the kne in the hand of the woman, so you attacked him, he told Couperthwaite.   You got him to the ground and you can be seen kicking him and stamping at him. We do not know what damage you did to this man because he remains a stranger. There is no other option I have but to give you a custodial sentence.” The attack occurred at .pm on February , the court heard. Couperthwaite was seen trying to batter down the door of the shop to get to the first man, before turning her attention to the passerby. She did not use the kne on him. In mitigation, her lawyer Nicholas Ross said: “The kne can be described as an eating kne rather than a cutting, kitchen kne. There are no excuses but she now wants to take opportunities. The male in question, she felt, had been looking at her on a number of occasions in a manner she felt was troubling. She had seen the man staring at her several times previously. What she did then however has absolutely no excuse. She is ashamed by her conduct.

After first looking into the possibility it was a crater made by the German bombings of Belfast in World War Two, the team realised the circular area was actually raised. Investigator Sheila Hoffman said the mound had hard edges so was unlikely to be the result of an explosion or depression in the ground from bombs, but appeared to be a mound.   Archaeologist Dr Karen Bellinger agreed and found there were large stones visible, making the site most likely to have been a Stone Age henge monument, and that is was likely used by Celtic Pagan savages. Speaking in the Discovery Channel documentary, Dr Mark Altaweel said Celtic tribes were in constant conflict with each other. And typically before battle they would have their priest perform ceremonies to get the tribe ready for the conflict ahead.   He speculated that before battle, humans including young men and girls were killed here to pacy and please pagan gods. He said: Typically the Celts captured someone to sacrice them. They would perform these rituals on these mounds, places that were elevated, in a way to bring them closer to their gods.

But now the mystery could finally unravel - with a coded message which appears to indicate where the teenager’s body was secretly buried. “Look where the angel points,” reads the message in an anonymous letter sent to her family. The angel is a centuries-old stone statue on top of an unmarked tomb within the the Teutonic Cemetery, which lies within the Vatican walls.   And unlike other many similar statues in the tiny city state, the angel’s hand is pointing downwards - towards whatever is buried underneath. The cemetery is not accessible to the general public and no-one knows who was once buried there.Yet the tomb is mysteriously tended every day, with a lit red votive candle that is never allowed to go out, and always fresh flowers in a vase. The only thing engraved on it is a marble scroll the angel holds, which reads Requiescat in Pace - or Rest in Peace. The Orlandi family now wants the Pope to grant permission to exhume whoever or whatever lies inside the tomb, which is reported to have been opened “at least once” - and resealed - within the last few decades.   A Vatican spokesman this week said in a statement that the Holy See is “studying” the matter and will soon decide whether to honour the request. If Emanuela is found to have been murdered and buried inside the Vatican it could engulf the Catholic church in its biggest scandal to date. And it will give oxygen to one of the most sensational theories about her disappearance - that the schoolgirl was kidnapped by high-ranking clerics who kept her as a sex slave before killing her. Pierto Orlandi, Emanuela’s brother, said he believes the Vatican’s highest powers know much more about his sister’s disappearance than they have so far let on. “I wish so much that this story was a hoax. I really wish Emanuela was not here,” he told a local newspaper. While this is the most precise indication yet of where she might be buried, the claim that she was snatched by a Vatican paedophile ring has been made before - by people close to the Churchs very centre of power.  The Vaticans chief exorcist Father Gabriele Amorth, a great confidant of retired Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, said in  that Emanuela was snatched from the streets of central Rome in the summer of  and forced to take part in sex parties.Fr Amorth, who died in , said: This was a crime with a sexual motive. Parties were organised, with a Vatican gendarme acting as the recruiter of the girls. The network involved diplomatic personnel from a foreign embassy to the Holy See. I believe Emanuela ended up a victim of this circle.”In , Monsignor Simeone Duca, an archivist with the Vatican, backed up the exorcist’s claims.He cited “credible information” that “certain factions” inside the Vatican’s diplomatic corps were involved in procuring young adolescent girls for sexual slavery. He, too, said he believed that the teenager was abducted for that purpose and later murdered. It is not the only theory that has emerged about what happened to Emanuela in what is still one of Italy’s most enduring mysteries.  They include the early claim that Turkish militants tied to the assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II had taken the schoolgirl to secure the release of Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to shoot the pope in . Then, in , the mistress of a gangster named Enrico De Pedis told authorities that he organised Emanuelas kidnapping at the behest of the controversial American archbishop, Paul C. Marcinkus, the former president of the Vatican Bank, who died in . Some have suggested that Emanuelas father Ercole, a Vatican clerk, had evidence of wrongdoing committed by Marcinkus, and that he asked De Pedis to kidnap the girl to keep the clerk quiet. A traffic warden who had seen Emanuela speaking to a man in a green BMW the night she disappeared worked to produce a sketch of the man, who looked very similar to De Pedis. And in , Italian journalist Emiliano Fittipaldi published a document that had been stolen from the Vatican. It appears to show that the church knew where the teen was and had been paying her expenses for years, including room and board and gynaecological examinations.  The Vatican called the document  and ridiculous. What is without doubt, though, are the very strange circumstances which surrounded her sudden vanishing on June , . The teenager, who had just finished her second year of high school, left the left the familys apartment in Vatican City and travelled to a flute lesson in Rome. On the way to the flute lesson, the man in the green BMW stopped her on the street and offered her money to sell Avon cosmetics, which she refused. Troubled, she called her sister to tell her about the incident. Once she arrived at the lesson, she was distracted and asked to leave early, around .pm. Emanuela was last seen in front of SantApollinare, a church in Rome belonging to the ultra-secretive Catholic organisation Opus Dei that played a mayor role in The Da Vinci Code novel. In the days after her disappearance the Orlandi family started receiving anonymous calls with tips about their daughters whereabouts, none of them leading anywhere.  Pope John Paul II waded into the case on July , , when he made a public appeal for her safeafter a public prayer, saying I am close to the Orlandi family. Two days after the pope’s address, someone called both the Orlandi family and the Vatican, saying that a group had taken the teen to secure the release of Mehmet Ali Agca. The caller, who was American, backed up his claims by leading agents to a photocopy of Emanuelas registration card for her music school, and sending a letter containing photo copies of the sheet music she was studying at the time. But he stopped communicating after October  and was never heard from again. A number of attempts have also been made recently to locate Emanuela’s remains, with the first linked to the secretive Opus Dei church. The only person ever investigated over the disappearance was Monsignor Piero Vergari, the former rector of the Sant’Apollinare church where she went missing. He was a friend of gangster Enrico De Pedis, and after he died he petitioned to let his body be buried at the Basilica of SantApollinare, a place usually reserved for senior clerics, not criminals.  In , De Pediss grave was exhumed to see whether Emanuelas remains might be hidden inside with his, but although, bizarrely, there were lots of human bones around his tomb, nothing matched the missing teen. And last November, workers renovating an annex of the Vaticans embassy to Italy in Rome discovered bones underneath the flooring, sparking immediate questions they may be connected to the teenager’s disappearance. Sometime after Emanuela’s disappearance, Monsignor Vergari is reported to have worked at the embassy. But the bones turned out to be around  years old. This week’s new lead could yet be another blind alley, or could maybe finally solve the mystery that has obsessed Italy, and haunted the Orlandi family, for over three decades. Emanuela’s brother Pierto knows there is still a long way to go to find the truth, especially as it could take weeks, months or even years, for the Vatican to respond to his family’s request to open the tomb. And with each day that goes by, he is more convinced that the Church knows much more about what happened to his lost sister than they had ever been willing to admit. He said: “Weve been asking for collaboration from the Vatican for  years. “Collaboration that has never been. This time we are asking again. Even collaboration that is discreet, just to understand. Just to remove this doubt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum blasted leaving five year","story":"NewsMum blasted for leaving five-year-old home alone to cook - and wanting sympathyThe heavily pregnant mum popped out to get a lunch she was cravingShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsThe little lad was left to fend for himself \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNo one would argue that having young kids is full on.That hateful mummy brain phrase  It exists because parents are often run ragged just trying to keep everything afloat.But does that justy leaving a five-year-old home alone, evenfor an hour  Evenyou believe he can fend for himself  One mum seems to think so, and its caused a huge backlash.The mum, who is also  weeks pregnant turned to Facebook for sympathy, writing in a group: Its a pain being pregnant and having to get my son ready and in the car, so I usually leave him home behind my fianceacutes back .

Doctors revealed the cautionary tale to make those of us who have a habit of falling asleep listening to music think twice. They sayone of the ear buds had not fallen out while the second-year university student was sleeping, he might have lost his hearing in both ears. The student gradually got his hearing back and narrowly avoided permanent hearing damage after receiving treatment at hospital in Taiwan. The man, who has not been identied, was reportedly treated at Asia University Hospital in Taichung City, where medics used the case to warn people to avoid falling asleep with ear buds in.Ear, nose and throat specialist Dr Tian Huiji, director of otorhinolaryngology, told OMG Taiwan that while people might listen to loud music during the day without experiencing sudden deafness, it is dangerous to do the same at night. The doctor explained that when sleeping the bodys blood circulation slows down. That leaves the highly-sensitive sensory hair cells in our ears responsible for detecting sound-waves less able to protect our hearing from loud sounds.That can result in sudden deafness. Ear buds are particularly risky culprits because, unlike headphones, they restrict any sound from escaping, Mail Online reports.Medical experts have been warning for years that young peoples use of ear buds to blast loud music is affecting their hearing in the long term. The NHS has also warned of the dangers of turning up the volume at full blast, saying it can cause long-term hearing damage. The World Health Organisationestimates  shymillion of people are severely disabled by hearing loss.One expert recently told the Mirror as our environment is becoming increasingly noisier , our use of headphones to drown out that background cacophony is a key problem.It can be tempting to blast your favourite song at full volume to cover up the noise of your rush hour morning commute. But it could be doing you long-term damage. The NHS warns against listening to music through earphones and headphones too loudly.It says the devices are among the biggest dangers to your hearing.Helpful official NHS tips include:Using noise-cancelling headphones rather than turning up the volume to cover up outside noise. Dont listen to music at more than  per cent of the maximum volume. Checkyour device has automatic volume-limiting settings. Turn up the volume just high enough so you can hear music comfortably, but no louder. Dont use earphones or headphones for more than an hour at a time. Take a break from listening through them for at least five minutes every hour.  The numbers affected by hearing loss globally are thought likely to grow. Our world is becoming ever-noisier with the growl of traffic and the modern demand to be constantly wired in to technology, and both are thought to be key factors in long-term damage. In recent weeks the WHO predicted an shyadditional one billion people globally, or half of all - year olds, were at risk of hearing damage.And last year a Dutch study found listening to loud music through headphones is damaging youngsters hearing - and could have lelong consequences.They said it was the first study ever to conclusively link portable music devices and noise-induced hearing loss in the younger age group. The scientists, who studied more than , children aged nine to -years-old over three years, found one in seven of the youngsters had suffered some kind of hearing loss.

He has marshalled a slight upturn in fortunes in recent weeks which has only been offset by the improved form of their relegation rivals Hamilton Accies and St Mirren, also.However, for Macca, it won’t be job done until Dundee are mathematically safe.And that is a long way off, as they sit in the relegation play-off place, three points behind Accies and only one ahead of the Buddies.Tonight, the Tele takes a look at the Dark Blues’ run-in to the split to see where they can pick up much-needed points.Dundee v Hearts # Saturday, March One of Dundee’s four wins this season, and their only one against a team which currently occupies the top six, came at Tynecastle at the end of January.That - success in Gorgie, coupled with the Jambos’ recent struggles – they are without a win in their last four league outings – will give the Dark Blues confidence going into Saturday’s clash at Dens Park.However, the Dee have only won once at home all season and need that to changethey are to have any hopes of staying in the ision.It’s must-win, for me, and I think they will rise to the occasion.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Celtic # Sunday, March A game in which Dundee will not be judged on come the end of the season but one,they keep it tight at the back, could see them sneak a valuable point.However, I fancy Celtic to go on a really good run as they look to wrap up eight titles in a row under new manager Neil Lennon.They’ll have too much.Verdict: No points.St Mirren v Dundee # Saturday, March One word. Ten letters. Hyphenated. Six-pointer.If the teams go into this one still practically neck and neck, which I expect they will, a win would be extremely valuable for both.However, I feel, with the enormity of the occasion, they will cancel each other out in Paisley.Verdict: One point.St Johnstone v Dundee # Wednesday, April The Dee and Saints have had some tasty encounters in recent seasons and this one should be no dferent with both teams likely to still have plenty to play for.St Johnstone may still be in the mix for the top six while Dundee’s situation is self-explanatory.I fancy the Dark Blues for this one, they play better on the road and have more to lose than the Perth men.Verdict: Three points.Dundee v Aberdeen # Saturday, April You have to go back to November  for the last time Dundee got a win of any sorts against the Dons.That’s a run of  games without a win, with  losses in a row.That run has to end at some point, so I’ll back the Dee for a hard-earned draw.Verdict: One point.Total points: Eight points.That would leave Dundee with  going into the split and, you would like to think, put them in a decent position to stay up. That is, depending on how Hamilton and St Mirren get on with their fixtures .Hamilton – Motherwell , Hearts , Kilmarnock , Livingston , St Mirren .Verdict: Five points.St Mirren – Kilmarnock , St Johnstone , Dundee , Celtic , Hamilton .Verdict: Eight points.That would leave Hamilton level and St Mirren a point behind Dundee."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/5c80eccb849c11.76417978.jpg ","title":"pals make meat loaf themed coffin to bid farewell to dundee entertainer marc","story":"Friends of a Meat Loaf-loving entertainer came together to make sure he was given a fitting final farewell.Marc Kingston died suddenly last month at the age of , having had cancer.Born in Peterborough, he had lived in Dundee for more than  years and was a well-loved performer and DJ known as Marc Meat Loaf, who hosted events in the city.This week his friends met at Dundee Crematorium to make sure the performer received a fitting send-off.Marc arrived in a custom- made coffin painted with Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell album cover and driven in a flame-effect hearse. vw, px\"   vw, px\"   vw, px\"  He was a huge fan of Meat Loaf, whose hits include I’d Do Anything For Love and Two Out of Three Ain’t Bad.The song Objects In The Rear View Mirror was played as guests left the service.

stop and enjoy the river in a iety of ways: to perch, to explore, to bask, to gather.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the city of Inverness arts working group, which is overseeing the wide-ranging public art programme of which Rest Spaces is one part, said she thought it was ldquorather magnicent.Adding that, cumulatively, the artworks being created along the riverside would make walking in the area a more interesting experience she said: \"There might well be some detractors but we are all iniduals.\"Councillor Ken Gowans, who was a vocal critic of the previous \"tilting pier\" proposals shelved several years ago, said he was more relaxed about the Bank Street installation.\"It will be in a very busy and popular location, especially with tourists, and I suspect it will add some interest to that part of the river,\" he said.Their remarks were made as other councillors continued to voice anger over revelations that the larger scale curving walls artwork proposed for a site close to the Ness Islands has been nodded through by planning officers rather than being put before elected members.Previously called The Gathering Place and My Ness, but referred to as My River Ness in the recently approved application, this artwork involves two crescent-shaped walls curving out from opposite sides of the river.Having been approved by officers under delegated powers councillors have reportedly been told there is now no way to call it in to the planning committeeNess-side SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam said he is set to meet with Inverness city centre manager David Haas over the issue and has called for a special meeting of the city of Inverness area committee.\"The natural urban environment is a key asset for Inverness and shouldnrsquot be degraded by development where it can be avoided,\" he said.\"The commitment by the previous council to spend on the original Gathering Place design, whilst not to everyonersquos pleasure, was based on an economic impact assessment which has never been revised to reflect the new location and design.\"Common sense tells you that not a soul will visit Inverness to view this utterly boring creation.\"He added: \"As things stand it appears that as a member of the Inverness city committee, a trustee of the Inverness common good fund and member of the south planning applications committee I, and therefore the people I am elected to represent, have not been involved in the decision-making.\"Inverness West councillor Bill Boyd, who also sits on the planning committee, said he has written to officers to complain about the way the application has been dealt with.However Councillor Graham Ross, depute provost for Inverness, said it was his understanding that the application had been advertised following normal procedures and had failed to attract enough objections to require it to go to committee.\"The decision to approve was then taken under delegated powers, which means it met with all the planning regulations,\" he said.Friday  Mar  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Second

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder.

Documents such as rent records, estate census papers, military papers, letters, maps and legal documents can offer a glimpse into the lives of people who lived across Argyll.The two-year Written in the Landscape project is set to wind up in July this year and has entailed cataloguing and digitising the Argyll Estate and other records to make them more accessible to the public.As Hannah and Jen travel round Argyll on their tour, the intention is to offer a local flavour from the archives aimed at each venue.For the Lochgilphead workshop on February , Jen and Hannah presented such erse items as #registers of the poor# and burgh court rolls from Lochgilphead, th century wage books from Kilmory Estate alongside military commission documents from the th century and a  map of the proposed Crinan Canal, surveyed by John Rennie.Each record offers a dferent insight among a treasure trove of detail.The Lochgilphead presentation followed a similar event in Campbeltown in January. Workshops will be held in March on Mull, Helensburgh in April before travelling to Strachur, Dunoon, Inveraray and Tiree in May.Further information on the Argyll Paper records can be obtained by emailing archives@inveraray-castle.

Shoppers stopped in their tracks and shopkeepers stood on their doorsteps to honour an Ayrshire soldier. Police sealed off the High Street to cars as the cortege arrived at the Kirk Port entrance to the Auld Kirk. The silence was broken only by the lament of a lone piper as Jock’s family filed their way into church. Jock’s coffin was carried into a packed service by men of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. His coffin was draped in a union flag and on top were his cap, belt, his campaign medals and a wreath. A dozen colleagues in the firing party formed a guard of honour after the coffin had passed under the  lych gate. Jock, , lived in Dundonald with second we Gigliola, better known as Julie. And he ran a log and firewood business, as well as being a yeomanry reservist. He was laid to rest with full military honours at Drongan where he spent his boyhood and where parents Dan and Rita live. The father-of-two died six days after his armoured car overturned at the Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire on January . Among the mourners in the Auld Kirk was Colonel John Dalrymple Hamilton, who was representing Prince Charles. Provost Helen Moonie of South Ayrshire Council also attended the service. And there was military top brass from both regiments in which Jock served –the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards and the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. Other regiments represented included the Royal Engineers, the Royal Artillery, the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers and the Le Guards. Members of the Army Cadet Force were also present to pay their respects. Jock was  years in the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, rising to be a Challenger tank commander. He survived tours of duty in Iraq, Kuwait and Kosovo, only to die in a training exercise. Auld Kirk minister Rev David Gemmell described how John McKelvie ‘grabbed le by the throat’ from his earliest days. He wasn’t much of a scholar at Drongan Primary and Auchinleck Academy, but he knew every creature that ran, crawled, swam or flew in the countryside. And a love of the great outdoors was a huge part of his le – whether it was fishing, playing rugby, ski-ing or mountain biking.  He and we Julie were fond of dogs, and Julie taught her big action man how to ride a horse, said the minister. Major Richard Boyle of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards read the lesson - ‘To every thing there is a season’ from Ecclesiastes. There were hilarious army anecdotes from best buddy JR Ewing, telling how they had shot at each other - with paintballs. J R also mentioned how when Jock was rebuked by a French officer in Kosovo, the big man pointed to his Royal Scots Dragoon Guards cap badge – a French eagle with the word Waterloo underneath. J R, his voice breaking, concluded by saying: “He was the best soldier I ever served with and my best friend.” Former RSDG officer Will Galbraith highlighted Jock’s pride in his regiment, his family and his friends. He said: “He had a strong sense of honour, of right and wrong, and would always stand up for the underdog.” Will said: “He was a big man, with a big voice and a big heart – a big character. But when you really got to know him, he was a big softie – although you wouldn’t tell him that. You had to be aware of those big hands.” Army chaplain Rev Duncan Macpherson said there were bound to be feelings of frustration, anger and regret at the way John McKelvie died. He hoped these would be resolved, adding: “He was someone who was thoroughly tested, who rose to the challenge and who was a thoroughly professional soldier. He was passionate about vehicles and made sure his was ready for any task.” Lt Colonel Toby Gaddum, commanding officer of the Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry, led the congregation in the regimental prayer. Rev David Gemmell brought the church service to an end by poignantly reciting “We Let You Go’. The poem ends: “We love you, we miss you, we want you to be happy. Go safely, go dancing, go running home.” A collection at the end of the service raised vital cash for the Ayrshire Yeomanry Families Fund. Jock was laid to rest at Drongan Cemetery, where a guard of honour fired three volleys from their rles.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrince CharlesRoyal Scots Dragoon GuardsSouth Ayrshire CouncilMiddle EastArmed forcesRoyal FamilyLove and romanceDundonaldAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr boxing king calvin mccord","story":"NewsAyr boxing king Calvin McCord crowned Scottish Lightweight Champion after thrilling bout at Trump TurnberryThe Ayr star won his first Scottish title in an exciting bout before a sell-out crowd in the Donald J Trump ballroom.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR NewsCalvin McCord celebrates with his title\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRing king Calvin McCord told how he got off the canvas twice to land his first Scottish title.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"college staging wine fuelled feast","story":"NewsCollege staging wine-fuelled feast as job cuts loomLeaked emails tell of lavish bash at cash-strapped Ayrshire CollegeShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCollege bosses have defended holding a celebration to honour their success amid a climate of drastic job cuts and cash problems. Ayrshire College supremos and invited senior staff will stage a sit-down feast later this month to mark five years since its formation. The dinner for  will also include free wine after a sponsored deal by college chairman Willie Mackie. Leaked emails state the claim the college is “now regarded as one of the most successful colleges in Scotland.” But our inside source said: “It adds insult to injury that this celebration is being held less than one week before the final jobs structure is issued to staff. “It is in extremely poor taste given the circumstances of potential job losses due to lack of funds.” Evening classes are having to be cancelled so the event can be staged at the Kilmarnock campus on March . Retiring principal Heather Dunk is also to be honoured during the evening. Chairman Willie Mackie said: “She has made a signicant contribution to Ayrshire for over  years.” Ms Dunk retired on February , leaving an impending restructure which will cost jobs. A consultation ends tomorrowand it has emerged the Private Finance Initiative which built the Kilwinning campus is a huge drain on funds. An email which Ms Dunk sent to staff in January read: “We need to make signicant savings to be financially sustainable due to the costs associated with the PFI, unfunded national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and other services. I am very disappointed that an organisational review is necessary, it is not what I want to be focused on in my last weeks as principal. “However, we must manage within the financial allocation we receive in this very dficult fiscal climate.” Under the consultation, one of the four vice-principals would be axed, three directors culled, heads of learning cut from  to nine, and three marketing coms staff would go. Also at risk of the chop are two posts within estates as well as a shake-up of duties among departments. The board of management will approve the final structure and staff impacted will get a severance package. Ayrshire College acknowledged finance was a major challenge for all Scottish colleges but said the dinner costs were met by sponsorship. A spokeswoman said: “Our main financial challenge for the year ahead is to meet the costs associated with the Kilwinning PFI Campus, national bargaining costs and the increasing costs of pensions, utilities and services. “While the Scottish Funding Council has agreed to provide further strategic funds to help manage these rising costs, the college still requires to make signicant savings to secure its financial sustainability and jobs for the future. “We are, therefore, considering proposals for an organisational review. “All staff are aware of the challenges the college faces, and have contributed to a consultation regarding potential efficiencies and opportunities for income generation. “We have just passed our five-year anniversary as Ayrshire College, and have planned an event, ‘Celebrating Five Years of Success. It is important to recognise this milestone and celebrate success – for learners, staff, the college and the region. “We are mindful of the costs of holding such an event and so have secured full sponsorship.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnUniversities and CollegesAyr NewsAyrEducationKilmarnockSchoolsKilwinning"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"end line rnli ayr charity","story":"NewsEnd of the line for RNLI Ayr charity branchThe Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.Share Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"facebook|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"messenger|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"twitter|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"whatsapp|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"linkedin|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"flipboard|share|\" Ayr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat.\" data-content-image\"https:i-prod.dailyrecord incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _emp_ayp_rnliJPG.jpg\" data-tracking\"email|share|\"ByAbi Smillie:,  MAR NewsAlicia Watson , Robin Whiteand David Macpherson\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era for a le-saving charity branch following failed attempts to gain members and volunteers. The Royal National Leboat InstitutionAyr branch announced their closure after it struggled to keep afloat. The branch, which has been around for over  years, issued an urgent appeal last November, appealing for a younger generation to pitch in to save the Ayr branch . Committee member and Secretary Robin White, said: “Sadly the number of volunteers helping to run the branch recently has been dwindling, to such an extent that so few are left the AGM came to the sad decision to close the branch down. However, a number of branch members have indicated they still wish to support the RNLI and will now do so via the Troon Branch. “This Branch is looking for new volunteers, soyou would like to help, please get in touch.” Ayr once had its own Leboat, stationed at Ayr Harbour in  under the management of Ayr Harbour Trust.   During the following  years a number of dferent Leboats were in service, one of which was built in Shadwell, London in  for just under pound. This was transported from London to Ayr Station by rail free of charge, by the London and North Western Railway Company. It was taken down Ayr High Street to Ayr Harbour and christened the ‘Janet Hoyle’, after the donor’s we. Eventually in  the RNLI Committee of Management decided to close the station as Troon had a motor Leboat where there was deemed a safer harbour entrance. There was then no RNLI presence in the town until the late ’s when a group of people decided to start a Fundraising Branch. This has been in existence ever since and has raised well over pound, in its time.

Now a row has broken out after it emerged one council department had not even bothered to speak to another. The unsightly corral cluster for five bins was secured in place near The Cross in Troon without any consultation. Troon Councillors have now become aware after a multitude of complaints. The cleansing department is claiming they contacted the planning department about the placing of the bins. But planners are denying any knowledge of a consultation. Troon SNP Councillor Craig Mackay is now leading the charge to find somewhere  for the bins to be situated, rather than outside the Jade Garden Chinese and Macintyre’s bar. He is asking for officials to meet councillors at the spot in Templehill to try and find a resolution. Councillor Mackay said: “We are trying to develop a coherent vision for our town centre. “I’m not convinced this is the best we can manage for such a high profile location. Cleansing regrettably installed these enclosures without any prior consultation. While it is arguably an operational matter that doesn’t require any such input,they had asked any of the councillors or the community council for comment then I am certain we would not have found ourselves in this situation. “The council’s Planning service disappointingly also appear not to have been consulted on the siting or design of this bin store within the conservation area. I don’t wish to play departments off against each other, but would seek to find a community consensus about what is appropriate for our public realm. “This will almost certainly involve an alternative solution for the bins.” A council spokesman confirmed they are investigating, saying: ““We introduced communal bins to keep the litter secure and away from gulls. The early indications are that this system is working well, however we are currently reviewing the location of the bins.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartyTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"look out sooty sweep heading","story":"NewsLook out, Sooty and Sweep are heading to AyrStage show insists laughs will come thick and fast at Ayr GaietyShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSooty is set to SWEEP into Ayr next month.

The story focusses on protagonist Charity Hope Valentine who is desperate to find her Mr Right.She works at the seedy Fandango Ballroom but has dreams of moving on to bigger things.But it may eventually be the performers themselves who reach the top ndash as their talent shone all evening. In the opening scenes Carla, Jan Bairdand Ruth Davidsonwowed the sell-out crowd with their renditions of classics including You Should See Yourself and Big Spender.And just when it looked as though Charity may have found the one when she meets Italian film star Vittorio Vidal, played by Jack McAulay, she ends up spending the night in his closet as his partner Ursulas home.The cast mastered their American accents, while Jackrsquos Italian twang seemed second nature. And he also impressed with his powerful performance of Too Many Tomorrows.Charity however gets her second chance when she gets stuck in a lt with Oscar ndash a claustrophobic accountant hilariously played by Clark Eaton Turner.Clark is no stranger to the Volunteer Hall stage, and it is clear that the versatile actor can turn his hand to anything. Everything looks well for the dance hall hostess, as Oscar proposes.But the wedding plans are dropped ndash and Charity has to find happiness within herself.On an evening of such commanding performances, it can be easy to forget the people who also work so hard behind the scenes to create this spectacle.Producer and musical director Jeff Thomson deserves huge credit as does choreographer Marie McCullough who obviously worked tirelessly.The sets are brilliantly designed and the scene-changes are swt. The orchestra was also given a deserved ovation at the end. There wasnrsquot a note out of place.Sweet Charity is running this week at the Volunteer Hall, Galashiels, until Saturday, March .

Ally Bally Bee - with a trail of children in his wake.Coltart also lived at houses in Henderson Close and Park Street, which have both since been demolished.And he was known to travel to nearby Melrose and Selkirk, as well as other Borders towns, to sell his candy on the streets.An appeal in January for further information on Robert Coltart saw Angela receive messages from across Scotland and even Canada, which helped with the final design.Historian Mary added: ldquoRobert Coltartrsquos story is one that many more people should know about and I hope this sculpture will encourage people to find out how the famous song Coulterrsquos Candy came to be written by a weaver from Galashiels.The finished tribute in the Market Square will become part of a new town trail, supported by the Scottish Government.Around pound, of improvements are planned as part of the regeneration of the town centre.Helen Calder of Energise Galashiels Trust, who has also championed Coltartrsquos story, said: ldquoWe want Galashiels to be a more vibrant, welcoming and confident community.\"The tale of Robert Coltart embodies this vision, and we are delighted progress is now being made to finally celebrate his link to our town.The funding from the Scottish Government is also supporting new visitor signage and improvements to Channel Street and Douglas Bridge, as well as helping to fund the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction.The town trail will include the location of Robert Coltartrsquos one bedroom flat in Overhaugh Street, which he shared with his family.Councillor Mark Rowley, who is the spokesman for business, said: ldquoIn line with other regeneration works going on in Galashiels, the Coulterrsquos Candy project has been taken forward with a number of partners and it was important they all had sight of the initial design before it was issued publicly.ldquoA real effort is being made to ensure visitors are attracted to Galashiels, and the wider Borders area, and it is worth noting that without the Great Tapestry of Scotland visitor attraction -

This was his first goal for the Pupils and just reward for his perseverance.It was good to see two teenagers making their mark for the club, with Ross Brown joining his academy teammate MacBrayne in a fine first half performance on opposite flanks of midfield.Nevertheless, the home side ‘stole’ into the lead in the st minute, a comic-cut situation that saw Ellis Robertson unbelievably penalised for stumbling over his own heels.The resultant free kick was delivered with venom and a headed deflection thundered into the net to restore the home side’s lead.The setback was short-lived as almost immediately the in-form Donald McCallum cut inside past two defenders to drive the ball high into the roof of the net for a superb equaliser.This heralded the Pupils# best spell of the match, with Ross Brown ending a great move with a volley that left the keeper rooted to the spot.But the goal, arguably the best of the match, was ruled out for offside.Ryan McConnachie was next to try his luck with an audacious overhead kick that just cleared the bar.Lady luck deserted the cause when the referee awarded a soft penalty kick to home club.The visitors were a goal behind despite dominating most of the second half.With  minutes remaining the league leaders looked to have sealed the points when a tactical long throw was forced home to give ‘the Port’ a two goal advantage.However, in an exciting end to another close fought match, Lee Allen scored a towering header from a Donald McCallum corner to make the score -.Despite a great effort in the closing minutes, the Pupils couldn’t score to get their just reward.Having played well and given everything, the visitors ed home with nothing to show for their efforts.TomorrowCampbeltown Pupilsto home action with another dficult match against third-placed Hillington at Kintyre Park with a pm kick off.  See social media and posters for confirmation of venue.Fraser MacBrayne in action earlier this season at Kintyre Park. _cpupils"},{"url":null,"title":"drama festivals farcical first night","story":"Accent Players# Grave Prospects, by Isabella C Rae, a mix of ghosts and the living, set in a contemporary graveyard, gave plenty of scope for laughs.Mission to Planet Bob, set in , staged by Dunaverty Players, cut the stage cast down to three suspended animation astronauts: Amy , Katieand Ed .Peninver Players# slapstick Melons at the Parsonage was the final Friday act with two plays within a third at an imaginary drama festival.At times Peninver#s action became confusing and caused adjudicator Jim Gibson to declare that he hoped he was not like its adjudicator Ted .Adjudicating at the end of the night, Mr Gibson said that the connection between all three plays was that they all ended in controlled lunacy.Speaking about Accent Players, Mr Gibson said: #There were very good dferent levels of set on the stage.#The make-up was nicely judged, particularly the ghosts, shades of grey but not .#I would have liked to have seen patchier lighting on stage, as it was fairly unorm, and perhaps some spots.#What was really nice was the fog coming on from stage left which reminded me of ectoplasm.#There was lots of good off-the-ball acting.

Such days are ones which have been borrowed from another month, and I think given the temperature and weather we have had recently the days have been borrowed from May.In , May will have borrowed Februaryrsquos days, so we can expect some unseasonal weather in that month as well, but in a dferent way.Sunday was a borrowed day for sure it was so mild and the later part sunny with a feeling of spring in the air. It was a perfect day for a discovery.We set off to find a place Irsquod only recently heard about. A friend had asked me what I knew about the lsquoKingrsquos Chairrsquo by Gullane. I had to admit that Irsquod never heard of it. He told me one of the holes at the golf course there has this name, but it seems it is named after a location nearby.This set me investigating. Sure enough, I found it marked on the map and searched for an image, which I found on a website called Ancient Stones: a large boulder, shaped like a throne, guarded by two other stones either side. It intrigued me and so our quest began.The starting point of our adventure was Gullane Beach car park. I knew roughly where to look but purposefully hadnrsquot brought the map so that we had a challenge to find the lsquochairrsquo. We knew what it looked like and that we needed to walk along the upper path, not the one that heads for the beach.We went the wrong way at first and got stuck in a mass of sea buckthorn, but on reflection that just added to the sense of adventure and achievement. We soon found our way and then suddenly there it was, up on Gullane Hill. The kids ran excitedly towards the stones, shouting: ldquoFound it, found it.I felt quite exhilarated at the discovery, and to be honest impressed by the sight of the Kingrsquos Chair. I can see how it got its name, as it looks something like a majestic reclining armchair. The two boulders on either side of it look like sentries keeping watch.The kids sat on it, of course, and I had to wait my turn after my we, who reckoned it could just as easily be a lsquoQueenrsquos Chairrsquo.When I finally got a chance to seat my majestic posterior on the chair, I realised the view was majestic as well, with Gullane Beach very visible in the near distance.I reflected on the fact we had recently visited Edinburgh Castle and seen the Stone of Destiny or Stone of Scone, along with the crown jewels. This rather uninspiring stone in Edinburgh Castle may be the coronation stone used for  years in England, but it is not, I am sure, the coronation stone used by ancient kings of Scotland, despite official claims that it is.I think itrsquos pretty clear that Edward I never got his hands on the real Stone of Destiny and I am convinced it has remained in Scotland, hidden somewhere, ever since. It occurred to me that this stone actually better fitted the early description of the original coronation stone at Scone than the one in Edinburgh Castle.ldquoImaginethis is the real Stone of Destiny and has been here all the time, I said fancully out loud. I know it isnrsquot, of course, but I have to saythis Kingrsquos Chair was on display at Edinburgh Castle it would certainly look more authentic.But sadly there seems to be no recorded tradition connected to this Kingrsquos Chair. I could find no story, or reference to the origin of its name. Perhaps some local people have some information on this There is an entry from the s that records the name, citing locals as the source, so there is some historic veracity in its title. But no suggestion is offered for the origin of the name, or any tradition associated with the stone. Its geology I could not say but it doesnrsquot seem to be a glacial erratic.And so we are left to wonder. We discussed how the stone got here and how it got its name. Maybe some children played here many generations ago and gave the boulder its title. Perhaps a Viking king who landed on Gullane Beach sat himself down on this natural throne to survey his warriors at their bloody work.Whatever the origin, the name, the location and the nature of the stone make this a worthwhile and fun discovery, even without a firm legend attached to it.And as I sat on the chair I watched smoke billowing from the coastline a little further to the west, close to the edge of Aberlady nature reserve. What caused the fire I didnrsquot know, but even from a distance it seemed destructive.It was a prophetic sight to witness from the Kingrsquos Chair. It looked like a burning coastline from a Viking raid. Thankfully the distant screech of fire engines told us help was on the way. The children wanted to go see the fire, but we kept our distance from the flames and let the firefighters do their job.So the trip to the Kingrsquos Chair had been an adventure in more ways than one. On our way back, the children advanced dferent theories about the origin of the name. It was universally agreed that a story must be made, but no agreement on the actual tale.ldquoPerhaps, I said, ldquowe should leave it to the imagination of those who search for and discover it, so they can sit and feel the power of the place and get ideas.My imagination was certainly ablaze. I saw the leader of the ancient Gododdin tribe, King Loth, sitting on the stone, looking out to the Firth as he watched his terried daughter in a small coracle being taken out to the open sea, his brutal punishment for her defiance of his authority.The story would fit as her journey began at Aberlady Bay, and so her small craft would have been seen from the Kingrsquos Chair as it passed by, being pulled out to sea by one of the kingrsquos boats.Itrsquos all a fancy of my imagination, of course, but thatrsquos my story.

Tell you that therersquos going to be a referendum on Brexit, that the ERG are back in their box, Jezza has finally come good, and Theresa May has been put in a secure unit. But I canrsquot in all honesty agree with commentators, like the blessed Polly Toynbee, who believe we are now on the road to redemption.Yes, Labour did repeat its promise to hold a referendumJeremy Corbynrsquos ldquoworkable plan of a permanent customs union is rejected ndash as it was in one of last weekrsquos many meaningless votes. Oh, and Labour will support a referendumthere is no General Election. Anda no deal Tory deal looks likely. If, , .ButLabour really wanted to eliminate the threat of no deal, it would have moved heaven and earth to deliver the SNPrsquos motion calling for precisely that.Looking back on this dismal week, the standout, surely, is the arrant insanity of Parliament ndash a rational body of elected representatives ndash failing to take the opportunity to rule out an event which would put the army on the streets, interrupt food and medicine supplies, and cause the loss of tens of thousands of jobs.Yes, the Yvette Cooper Oliver Letwin amendmentwas endorsed by Parliament overwhelmingly, after Theresa May gave it the nod. This means that there will be an extension to Article Parliament doesnrsquot support a deal by March . Well and good. If therersquos one thing the UK Parliament is supremely good at itrsquos failing to agree.It doesnrsquot like Mayrsquos botched deal, the Norway option, EFTA or any other solution that Brussels thinks acceptable. So that means an extension is inevitable. Except that the French president Emmanuel Macron and the Brussels negotiator, Michel Barnier, have made clear that the  countries of the EU , will only contemplate delaying Britainrsquos departure from the EUit is for ldquoa purpose. Holding more meaningless votes, staging more ministerial resignations and arguing on College Green outside Parliament do not, one suspects, constitute a legitimate purpose.Still, everyone seems convinced that an extension is in the bag. This led to largely unwarranted excitement on the Remain side. With Labour calling for a Peoplersquos Voteand Theresa Mayrsquos deadline finally breached, Twitter went into orbit. Lord Adonis all but declared victory in the Battle of Brexit. Europhiles were dancing in the streets, metaphorically at least, and jeering at the nasty Brexiters who had been defeated by the forces of good. It was like the last reel of Lord of the Rings.But such triumphalism was premature. Much as I wish it were the case, there is still no majority in Parliament for a referendum. Stephen K Bush, the political editor of the New Statesman, has been counting them out and counting them back in again and he is adamant that the Labour Brexit rebels will prevent any motion for a referendum passing through Parliament. He says at least  Labour MPs are opposed. Hersquos right.ldquoRebels here is something of a misnomer since there is widespread belief that Brexit is the outcome desired by their leader. Indeed, on one interpretation of last weekrsquos events, Jeremy Corbyn has managed to find a way to secure Brexit while also appearing to support a referendum. This is because what is called the Kyle Wilson amendment.This cross-party proposal, which Labour is minded to support on March , calls for MPs to agree to Theresa Mayrsquos deal , but only on the condition that there is a referendum to validate it. Bingo. Labour can tell all its working-class Brexit supporters in target marginals that, yes, it didnrsquot block Brexit. But Jeremy can also curry favour with the Remainiacs of Islington by appearing to support a Peoplersquos Vote.Itrsquos very clever, but to my mind somewhat bonkers. Why would Labour help pass Theresa Mayrsquos deal, which Jeremy Corbyn has said is worse than no deal, would lose thousands of jobs and would lock the UK into a backstop from which it cannot escape  At least this is what he has said repeatedly in the Commons.Surely, a vote is a vote. Theresa May could legitimately say that her deal has been endorsed by Parliament, and call on Labour to campaign for it in any referendum. Not that she has the slightest intention of calling a referendum.Theresa Mayrsquos strategy is the same as it ever was: not listening, nothing has changed, take it or leave it. It pains me to say it, but the Prime Minister at least has a strategy. It is to run down the clock, while allowing the ious tribes in Parliament and in her Cabinet, to fall out among themselves.Itrsquos working. Labour is moving ever more in the direction of her deal, however much they may deny it. Parliament canrsquot agree on anything.There are tears in Cabinet and more resignations ndash  from the Government so far. But whorsquos counting  The European Research Group ndash that comically misnamed faction of extreme Brexiters ndash has reportedly split over William Rees-Moggrsquos equivocation on the Irish backstop.And while all about is chaos and acrimony, so ticks away the clock until Brexit day. Twenty-eight days at the time of writing. Goodness me, is that really the time  Yes it is. As in the film of the same name, the zombies are stirring.I accept that is an offensive way to describe Nigel Faragersquos ldquoBrexit Betrayal march from Sunderland to London. But it could get nasty on the road.What do I think will happen in the end  As Irsquove been saying in this column since Christmas, I think Parliament will block a no-deal Brexit. There will be an extension of Article , and Labour will probably end up backing Mayrsquos deal, or abstaining on it which amounts to the same thing.If Labour, by some remote chance, continues to reject Mayrsquos deal or its iants, in the meaningful vote on the inglorious twelfth, then I think MPs would still reject a referendum. There is still no majority for one, and Labourrsquos die-hard Brexiters are not for turning.Which makes the most likely option ndash about the only one Theresa May can authorise as PM under her prerogative powers ndash would be to revoke Article . Pull the plug. End it.OK, so thatrsquos wishful thinking on my part. Her Government would fall and precipitate an election. But looking at the chaos that is Brexit, and the lack of time, it seems as good a shout as any, especiallyBrussels reject a meaningless extension.If Britain canrsquot decide how to leave the EU, an extension to Article  would be pointless. The sensible thing to do would be to cancel Brexit, go away, and think again."},{"url":null,"title":"vinyl-flooring-covers-all-bases","story":"New trends continually arrive to push old favourites to one side, and, later, it all comes full circle and we start to see things that were considered lsquoold fashionedrsquo, and that we thought had gone forever.Having walked on carpets for so many years, we are now seeing a resurgence of retro flooring that brings to mind the Art Deco period of highly-stylised, geometric design, and the colourful vibrancy of a Moroccan bazaar.In our homes, we have been throwing out the underlay and favouring the stripped-back and natural look underfoot.

In March , Holyrood voted - to request another Section  order because of Brexit, but Mrs May refused to grant it.After the SNP lost a third of its MPs and half a million votes in the  election, Ms Sturgeon ldquoreset her plan and promised a new ldquoprecise timescale by last autumn.However, it has been repeatedly delayed by uncertainty over Brexit.With time running out to hold a referendum within the current Scottish Parliament, many in the Yes movement are now pushing for a Catalan-style unofficial vote instead.But speaking to the media at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoMy view is clear and has always been clear. The legal basis of any future independence referendum should be the same as the referendum in , which is the transfer of power under a Section  order.ldquoThe anti-democratic stance of the Tories should not stop the SNP or the Scottish Government seeking a Section  order and planning on the basis that we would win that case and that argument.ldquoThatrsquos what Keith meant.

I want and consider that the basis of the referendum should be the same as the last time.ldquoOf course the UK Government is the one thatrsquos taken a dferent position on that right now in a stance that in my view is completely counter to democracy.Mr Hunt said the Scottish Government should focus on voter concerns such as health and education, not another ldquovery isive independence referendum. but to focus on the education system, which used to be the envy of the world.

Irsquom knackered when I get in at night but everything from handling the barrels to swinging the hammer is already starting to feel a lot more natural.Fellow apprentice Kirsty Olychick left Canada to join the cooperage apprenticeship. ldquoIrsquove always been inspired by the Scotch industry, she says.ldquoI like the fact that you learn the skill by hand ndash you get the satisfaction of seeing the job done rather than reading about it in a book.ldquoItrsquos such an exciting prospect to think that Irsquoll be contributing to the next generation of Scotch.

And so too the Scotch whisky industry is changing.Not only are more women enjoying whisky more than ever, today making up a third of whisky drinkers in the UK, but the people who craft Scotch whisky in communities across Scotland are changing too.Yet while the industry sheds its macho image, the idea that women might ndash like their ancestors ndash take the helm of its production is still in its infancy for some.At Talisker, Farrell recalls a particularly sweet moment.ldquoI was in my driveway and one of my neighbours was walking past.ldquoHe said, lsquodoes your man work at the distillery rsquo I said lsquoNo, I run the distillery, Irsquom the manager therersquo, she recalls. ldquoIt was one of the best moments of my le."},{"url":null,"title":"conversations-about-womens-vulnerabilities-feel-so-regressive","story":"I saw my news story about it shared on a friends Facebook page.

Asking for safe spaces for women leads the likes of feminist writers Julie Bindel or Germaine Greer to be no-ed - because even to discuss these ideas is claimed to be harmful.Perhaps certain feminists have wrongly assumed other people share their knowledge and these reminders are actually necessary.Have we come so far, made so many gains, that, in fact, the majority of women feel no threat and have forgotten the fight  While arguing over sex-neutral toilets in schools, are young girls looking at the women laying a case on their behalf and wondering what on earth were fussing about Age dferences do matter.

It is therefore unsurprising that barn owls in the north of Scotland have a hard time during the winter months, with peak mortality rates being between December and March due to starvation.As temperatures start to drop in winter, small mammals become less active, meaning a lot less food is available for barn owls, and they need to work extra-hard to find it. This often results in the owls being forced to feed during daylight, even though they are naturally nocturnal hunters.This lack of food is particularly dangerous for barn owls as they are poorly insulated and need more food in winter to provide them with enough energy to stay warm.The Barn Owl Trust estimates that between  and  barn owls are killed each year on UK roads.RSPB Scotland site manager Dave Jones recently sent a deceased barn owl to the Scottish Agricultural College in Thurso for autopsy, when some concerned neighbours reported it after finding it at the roadside.The results of the autopsy showed that the bird was fit and healthy, \"in good shape and hunting successfully\", and that the death followed trauma to its wing and abdomen ndash suggesting that the bird died as a result of being hit by a vehicle.Dave said: \"It is extremely sad to discover that a fit and healthy birds le ended in this way. The barn owls in Caithness really are at the edge of their natural comfort zone and are particularly vulnerable in winter, so it isnt an unusual result, unfortunately. Its not all doom and gloom, though. Although we still find some casualties in this way, our population of barn owls in Caithness has recovered from the particularly poor winters of   and  , and they are considered to be the most northerly population of barn owls in the world.\"While we cant control the weather, there are some things we can do to help. If putting up a nest box, please make sure it isnt placed close to any busy roads. If you see a road casualty and it is safe to do so, please stop and report the find to your local wildle officer and to the Barn Owl Trust.

From isles patients attending hospital appointments to local businesses trying to remain competitive, these services are a genuine leline.“Even at this late stage, we would urge HIAL and the unions to get back round the table and resolve this dispute.  Ministers must also do everything possible to help broker a resolution and avoid the massive disruption any airport closures would inevitably cause.#Following Friday#s announcement from the Prospect union, that air traffic controllers under their membership had voted to undertake industrial action, HIAL said, as a government-sponsored agency, they had to follow the Scottish Government pay policy, and could not implement pay awards more than that directed by the government.A Scottish Government spokesman has since weighed in on the situation, saying: “HIAL has implemented a pay rise for all staff, which is a signicant improvement on previous years, as well as signicantly increasing their contribution to their pension scheme in order to maintain this benefit for employees. Staff also continue to receive generous annual leave, sick pay and other allowances.“In the face of the UK Government’s continued budget cuts, the Scottish Government delivered a distinctive and progressive Pay Policy for   — one which is fair, supports those on lower incomes and protects public sector jobs and services while delivering value for money for the people of Scotland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It’s interesting because, no matter where I go, these are the three predominant issues, and they are all related.”There are around  EIS members in Orkney.On Monday, EIS members voted to reject a new pay offer.According to Mr Ramsey, the next step will be to hold a ballot on industrial action, although the union remains open to further negotiation.“Assuming that our members decide to vote for a strike, there will be two or three weeks before that goes through,” the vice-president explained.“We intend to continue to negotiate. We realise that teachers don’t want to strike — they do not do this lightly. We have even made a decision not to strike during the SQA exams.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the airline’s marketing chief Natalie Bowman put it: “We’re excited to showcase a pilot who’s risen to super hero status - an image that embodies strength and confidence and inspires future aviators across our expansive network to go further.”Scotland may not have any female airline chiefs, and Amanda McMillan, who ran the Glasgow, Aberdeen and Southampton airports group has moved on.However, there have been signicant appointments in other areas, with Syeda Ghufran last summer becoming ScotRail’s first female engineering director.: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellHaving joined the operator from university as a management trainee nine years ago, she has talked of wanting to change perceptions and encourage more young women to consider engineering “as a viable and rewarding career”.In a further positive sign, half of ScotRail’s latest engineering apprentices are female, albeit there is a big inbalance to address.A second important development was former Scottish Prison Service and Scottish Police Authority executive Catherine Topley becoming chief executive of Scottish Canals.She has a keen awareness of the waterways’ potential to improve people’s lives, from youngsters learning boating skills and elderly people getting the chance to enjoy green space to opportunities for deprived communities along the banks.: Alastair Dalton: The vested interest blocking cuts to air pollutionOther high-profile women who provide key role models include the managers of Scotland’s two busiest stations, Juliet Donnachie at Edinburgh Waverley and Susan Holden at Glasgow Central.The latter’s profile will be raised by being featured in a six-part series on the station which started on the new BBC Scotland channel last Sunday.However, Scotland’s railways - and the rest of transport - still has far to go.

They provide assurances a companys owners have the wherewithal to honour bills.\"Yet, just two months after the directors of Cairngorm Mountain Ltd signed it off as a going concern for another year, it went into administration owing money to at least  businesses, many of the them local.\"Its time that the four directors of CML were investigated and that the ultimate owner of the company, David Michael Gorton, who provided the assurances to the auditor was held to account.\"He continued: \"This follows four years during which they have been only too happy to see money taken out of Cairngorm Mountain through the large management fees paid to Natural Retreats ndash their main money spinner ndash out of which the CML directors paid themselves most generously.\"This was to the tune of pound, in the last accounts of the UK Travel Company to  shared between three directors.\"Latest papers filed with Companies House last week have revealed there were no requests for a creditors meeting.It will now be for the administrators Campbell Dallas to distribute the proceeds from the pound, sale of the business to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and other assets that were owned by CML.Just over pound, of that will be in fees to the administrators meaning it is highly likely not all of the creditors will be repaid in full.A signicant proportion of the debts ndash some pound, is owed to Natural Retreats-related companies ndash but the rest will have implications for the local economy.Amongst local firms still owed money according to the documents are the Spey Valley Hire Centre, David Ritchie  Sons Ltd, BSW Sawmills, Colin Baxter Photography Ltd and McGowan Ltd.Starbucks, EDF Energy and Screwfix Direct are also amongst the creditors while chartered surveyors Graham and Sibbald are still owed pound,.Rural Economy Secretary and Strathspey MSP Fergus Ewing said everyone is working hard to \"address and mitigate the adverse impact on the local economy\".

I regularly ask HIE for updates to ensure the local community and economy are front and centre of all decisions they make.\"Regional MSP Edward Mountainsaid: \"I am hugely disappointed that businesses in the Highlands have been left out of pocket and this matter should be investigated fully.\"I strongly believe that the management structure of Cairngorm Mountain that has been used in recent years is not fit for purpose.\"A spokesman for Campbell Dallas, said investigating the conduct of directors is a statutory requirement in every insolvency. He commented: \"The content of the conductsubmitted to the Insolvency Service must remain confidential.

Over the last few weeks KPL staff have been busy ferrying equipment, supplies and crews out to it as part of the first such contract secured by the yard. During a visit, I expected to find a hive of activity the roar and clang of big machines.But on Thursday of last week I found the whole site surprisingly quiet. This, I am told, is because most of the activity is now taking place onboard what KPL directors refer to as the OGW.“The rig is crawling with insurance people and regulators right now,” says one of the directors, Simon Russell, as he shows me round. “They are all signing off their bits and pieces before the rig gets the final piece of paper that says it’s good to go.”Every weld is being stress tested. Every item of equipment is being put through its paces.Before the rig can face the punishing swells of the north Atlantic, such attention to detail is a matter of le and death.There are also inquisitive guests onboard, doing a little window shopping. They’ve been helicoptered straight on to the rig, the property of US firm Diamond Offshore. These VIPs are potential customers from major players such as Tarka Oil, here to see what the buzz is all about. While doing so, they may also be mightily impressed with Kishorn Port Ltd. That is the hope, anyway.As you are reading this, there is a good chance the Ocean GreatWhite, with a crew of  aboard, will be making its way back up the Minch. If the weather is favourable it may even be doing so under its own steam, without the need for a fleet of tugs to tow it to the Blackrock prospect, some  miles north west of Shetland.So advanced is the OGW that each corner-leg contains two enormous thrusters, powered by engines capable of generating , brake horse power of thrust. For non-petrol-heads that’s  Ferraris per engine. A top speed of eight knots is the result. Not bad for a structure that isn’t exactly designed to cut through the water. Stability is the name of game: even in the roughest seas the thrusters are meant to ensure that the rig doesn’t deviate by more than a metre from the drill point. West of Shetland, it may need every Newton of force those thrusters can provide. Once safely in place, the Ocean GreatWhite will be used by Siccar Point Energy and Shell UK to test for oil in an unexplored area of the seabed.“This is really cutting edge stuff,” enthuses Alasdair Ferguson, the other director in this   venture involving his own firm, Ferguson Transport and Shipping, and Simon’s LeithsLtd. “The rig can operate in , feet of water and drill a hole , feet deep.”In other words, that’s six miles into the earth’s crust. This is how far down we now have to go to get the black stuff. As the ‘Age of Oil’ wanes, rigs like the OGW could become the workhorses of the near future.However, the days of building giant concrete caissons to support them are long gone. Whatever finished products emerge from Kishorn in the next few years, another Ninian Central will not be among them. Deep water is where the action is – and that means floating oil rigs like the Ocean GreatWhite, a sixth-generation model designed specically to harvest the hard-to-reach hydrocarbons that now makes up much of what the UK still produces. Thankfully for Kishorn, that means west of Shetland.  According to Simon, this trend involves the “centre of gravity” shting away from Aberdeen and towards the west coast.KPL is ready and waiting for that trend to continue.“The same thing is happening with offshore wind,” says Simon. “If you look at the next round of Crown licenses you’ll see that most of them are here on the west coast.”“We want to create a multi-use facility,” adds Alasdair. “We want to build resilience into this facility so that it is not reliant on any one industry.”Offshore wind turbines need concrete caissons, albeit smaller than the Ninian Central’s. That’s another box ticked in favour of Kishorn.From about  metres away, the Ocean GreatWhite does indeed look like a floating hotel, to use Simon’s description. Unfortunately, this is as close as we are allowed to get. Obtaining insurance cover for non-crew is a minefield Diamond Offshore also doesn’t want any photographs taken of their cutting-edge equipment. So circling the rig aboard the ‘Infinity’ will have to do for us.Aside from ferrying crew to and from the Ocean GreatWhite, the ‘Infinity’ usually takes tourists out to St Kilda from the Stein jetty in Waternish. But that happens mostly in the summer.“We have been flat out doing this since the rig arrived,” says skipper Kenny Mackinnon.Regular work over the winter is good for those who don’t usually have it.In fact, the arrival of the OGW has been a boon for the area. Twelve locals have been taken on in ious positions. This is the direct benefit. There is a harder to quanty knock-on effect for local businesses in what Alasdair refers to as the “downstream supply chain”. Everything from additional bed nights to sandwiches bought in the nearest shops are covered by this concept. And there have been quite a few of those over the last six weeks.Food and lodgings for visiting crews and subcontracted workers might sound like small beer, however. But the temporary largesse created by the presence of the OGW could be the start of something much bigger.Nothing like the crazy days of the s and s, though, when a town of , people sprung up in accommodation blocks behind the dry dock. That kind of development, said Simon, will not happen again, partly because of the strain it would place on local infrastructure.  Instead, he envisions - people employed directly at the site.The prefabs of Kishorn’s heyday are long gone but the dry dock is still here, its original concrete floor as good as new, so I’m told. The faint imprint of the Ninian Central , once the biggest manmade object ever moved across the face of the Earth, is still visible a spectral impression of the past.KPL have more modest ambitions than trying to resurrect what was.Simon and Alasdair are building in small steps. They’re making progress, just at a slower pace than many would like to see.Further investment is required to speed things up. That, however, is based partly on more rigs using the yard. KPL have a few irons in the fire on that front, but nothing definite yet.“The revenue this will generate will enable us to extend one of the piers, out into the deeper water, so we can load and unload directly rather than having to ferry equipment and people back and forth,” says Alasdair.Just sixty metres from the shore Loch Kishorn reaches a depth of around  metres, easily enough to accommodate oil rigs which, it should be remembered, need taken apart when they’ve reached the end of their working lives. Decommissioning s is on the KPL menu too.If , jobs were a flash in the pan,  jobs might be the sustainable optimum. By definition, the slow build lasts longer than the quick buck.In this place of big numbers,  might be big enough."},{"url":null,"title":"castle tower pupils are guests of honour for ballymena s royal visit","story":"Staff and pupils from Castle Tower made memories to last a letime after they were special guests at the recent Royal visit to Ballymena.A delegation from the school was invited to The Braid to personally greet the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their arrival in the town.With several hundred well-wishers turning out to cheer Prince William and Catherine, young people at Castle Tower were provided a unique vantage point, with many shaking hands and chatting with the couple.The pupils were joined by Castle Tower governors Councillor Audrey Wales MBE and Anne Donaghy, chief executive of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.Cllr.

As Moy Park celebrates  years in business, Aaron reflects on changes in the sector and milestones along the way. He said: “I first joined Moy Park in  when I was still at school, working part time at the weekends as a factory operative. “As a student, it was a great insight into the world of work and business. It taught me the value of hard work, money earned, and motivated me to want to do more of both! “After gaining a degree in Health and Leisure from Queen’s University Belfast, I was keen to move into a business environment and decided to apply to Moy Park’s Graduate Management Programme, to find out more about a career in one of our fastest growing industries, agri-food. “The two-year programme was the ideal way to find out more about ious strands of a business, from operations to finance, HR and marketing, and what might suit my skillset best. “From my time as a sht worker on the factory floor, I had a healthy respect and interest in the processing side of Moy Park, and the opportunities and challenges therein. “Once I completed the Graduate Management Programme - which we still use as a recruitment tool today - I took up a position as a sht manager, capitalising on my people management skills and interest in operations. “Since then, I have worked my way up across a number of Moy Park’s sites – moving from factory manager to area manager and have now been General Manager at Ballymena for two years. “Ballymena is a great place to work. From a business point of view, it’s strategically located with fantastic transport links and from a social standpoint, you’ll never find yourself wanting for something to do – from shopping to socialising over a drink or a bite to eat. It’s also quickly becoming the spa capital of Northern Ireland! “While Ballymena has faced a number of economic challenges, it’s an area with a rich history and heritage of business success. This spirit is still very much evidenced by the people, businesses and organisations in the town today. “Mid and East Antrim Council has an ambitious integrated economic development strategy for the area to help encourage business growth across the borough, and it’s one we are keen to help support. “It’s a strategy important not just to Moy Park as a business, but to me personally. “I sit on Mid and East Antrim Council’s Manufacturing Task Force Team, a working group committed to supporting and fostering growth. I was delighted to attend Westminster with a delegation from the Task Force recently when Northern Ireland representatives presented their plans for a Belfast City Deal. “Hearing these plans certainly gave us food for thought when it comes to nurturing growth locally. “As Ballymena’s General Manager, I’m responsible for all business s at the site – from technical to HR and finance. “With over , members of staff, it’s a erse and busy job but that’s what makes it worth doing. In the last  years, business management has evolved signicantly. “While there might be more paperwork, regulations, travel and late nights, there is also an incredible amount of collaboration - with customers, industry, educational bodies and government and our local communications. “Managers today cannot afford to work in silos, you need to adopt an attitude of knowledge sharing and foster an environment of innovation to truly succeed. “My key piece of advice to anyone viewing management as a career is to do your research and bolster your skillsyou need to. Being a good manager isn’t a static position, you constantly need to challenge yourself, and a good employer is one who lets you not only challenge yourself but equips you with the skills to overcome these challenges. “One of my own personal highlights over the last  years was been being named ‘Young Processor of the Year’ at the Meat and Poultry Processing Awards in . “Given my background working on the factory floor, it was great to win an industry award.

I am delighted to take the lead on this project and look forward to working with all of my international colleagues to ultimately help attain gender equality in the entrepreneurship domain in particular and also within broader society.”Police investigating child arrest Facebook footageTen-year animal ban for man who kept dogs in ‘unsuitable’ state Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"special exhibition celebrating tech","story":"Southern Regional College is hosting a special exhibition event to celebrate the achievements which the Banbridge campus has made over the past  years.Building work on the new £ million state-of-the-art SRC Banbridge campus, scheduled to open in September , is already well under way and this unique event will give former students, staff, associates and members of the public a unique opportunity to say a final farewell to the ‘old’ campus on Castlewellan Road.A rear view of the old library and technical college following its extension in  which remains in existence today.The event, which is open to everyone, takes place on Tuesday, March  at pm and will incorporate a special exhibition to celebrate the Ccollege’s proud history, legacy and successes.

The little trawlers are impounded, their crews taken hostage. But why Captain Jamie Bryson was once the Royal Navy’s most decorated and respected nuclear sub commander. But now he’s living in semi-retirement in the sleepy backwater of Donaghadee, tending his garden by day, chairing the parish council by night. When the call comes from Whitehall for him to take to the conning tower for one last top-secret mission, Captain Jamie has to make a choice between his chrysanths and his country#“Action, romance, danger, flute music. This one has it all.” The Ballymena .“An explosive tale of international intrigue that gallops breathlessly from Glengormley to Dundalk and straight to the gates of hell.” Shankill Buy and Sell.“A really cracking holiday read and, believe me, I know what I’m talking about.” Ian Paisley Jnr.“But Sinn Féin.” Slugger O’Toole.Chapter oneCONTACT‘Up periscope!’Captain Jamie Bryson’s voice was tight with tension as he barked the order. He bent and took the handles, his knuckles whitening with the force of his grip. He welcomed the cold anger, it made him feel alive he channelled it, bent it to his will. Anger and training: the fighting man’s best friends – how well he remembered that from his first day at Submarine School Newtownards.The Astute class hunter-killer nuclear submarine sat sleek and silent  metres below the cold, dark Irish Sea. Captain Jamie’s eyes narrowed as he slowly scanned the still waters of Clogherhead harbour, past the pastel colours of the little trawler fleet until at last his crosshairs came to rest on the dull grey hull of the LÉ Orla. The battlecruiser lay squat and sinister in a corner of the harbour commanding a direct view of the two kidnapped Ulster fishing boats, the Amity and the Boy Joseph, two of its four .mm heavy machine-guns trained on the wheelhouses where captain and crew lay on the floor trussed up like pigs.Captain Jamie pushed the periscope handles into the closed position and took a step backward. “Battle stations,” he rasped, “make ready forward torpedo hatches”Executive Officer Willie Frazer’s face creased into a mask of doubt and uncertainty. “But Captain, we’re under strict orders to maintain a watching brief.”He’d served under Captain Jamie for close on  years and never questioned an order – no need to, for Captain Jamie was a Man of the Sea: confident, experienced, exuding an air of calm authority that brooked no dissent.“Mr Frazer, you have your orders.” Captain Jamie’s words were low, but there was no mistaking his deadly seriousness.“Yes, Captain.”A light wind ruffled the short sleeves of Captain Jamie’s immaculately-pressed white shirt and a weak winter sun glinted off the shiny black peak of his cap as he took his place on the conning tower. He fixed his binoculars on the brooding hulk of the LÉ Orla and stood fixed and resolute as a statue. At his shoulder, XO Frazer gripped the cold metal around him to stop his hands from shaking. Though he didn’t take his eyes from the glass, Captain Jamie sensed his number two’s unease.“Mr Frazer,” he said, his gaze still on the enemy ship. “If those trawlers aren’t released by noon, we open fire. Ulster demands it.”• The Clogherhead Convention.

It is not without irony that the words spoken at that event proved this week to be prescient.Law is meant to provide a moral compass for society, allow us a set of norms by which we agree to conduct society and protect the vulnerable. We live in streets where for decades law was either disregarded or used as a tool in a weaponry of oppression. Those reading this paper who were subjected to the ignominy of its abuse will all know too well what happens when law does not work. It incites and prolongs conflict, harm and pain. But most of all the corruption of law leads to despair. Where can we gowe do not have the protection of law The single most important achievement of the Good Friday Agreement was the review of criminal justice. It was a recognition that the corruption of law needed to be endedwe were to truly ensure our conflict never happened again.When the Supreme Court in London delivered its findings in the challenge by the Finucane family to the decision by the British government not to hold a public inquiry, it was a finding in law. It was not about Weston Park, nor about governmental promises, nor about changing economic environments. It was about what was right in law. And with its clear, non-political eye, saw that an inquiry was required into this pernicious example of state collusion in the killing of an officer of the courts.When last week there was an announcement that inquests would at last have appropriate structure and funding this was because of the domestic and international courts refusing any argument that the application of the rule of law could be subject to political favour or will. Legal compliance is not subject to negotiation.No matter who the citizen is, whatever their background, they should expect the law to defend them. No matter how big the power, whatever their political philosophy, they should expect the law to hold them to account. That is how it works. And it can remedy previous imbalance.Right now, the long arm of those who abused their position and the law in the RUC is reaching into the PSNI to undermine the courts addressing the crimes of the past. Alongside elements of the military and security services these vested interests are doing it because the law, through its courts and processes such as the Police Ombudsman, is holding previous members of state agencies and the narrative of the state as upholders of law and order to account. This is a critical time. Confidence in the building of a truly human rights-compliant system of law, order and justice relies on the rule of law winning against politically motivated vested interests. Some will try to portray these developments as uneven or unbalanced. Quite the reverse is true."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"roisins debut play is very close to home","story":"I’M with West Belfast actress and scribe Róisín Gallagher to ask her the unthinkable question – how on earth she managed to write and now perform a new play which deals with the fallout of her father’s passing  Róisín describes her debut work – Natural Disaster – as “Deeply personal, my own journey through losing my dad to cancer much, much too soon.” She continues: “Natural Disaster is my artistic response to how I felt from when he was diagnosed, how I felt when he passed away, how I coped with the aftermath of that and where I am now.”The play will be performed as part of theatre company Tinderbox’s ‘Takeaway’ experience which runs at the MAC from March  to . “I feel that Tinderbox and its artistic director, Patrick J O’Reilly, have a really innovative and empowering  for artists to create work in the form of ‘takeaway’ theatre,” adds Róisín. “I was lucky enough to have my idea selected so that Tinderbox would work with me, mentor me and basically give me what I needed to make this seed of an idea grow into an production.”Speaking to me on her first day of rehearsal, the former St Genevieve’s High School student says the language of the play – like the title – is deliberately non-specic.“It’s about really, on the surface, preparing for the inevitable. During the piece I never mention death, I never mention anything being lost, in fact I say very little. The piece is very movement-based, it’s an interpretation of grief, because I wouldn’t be able to stand up and talk about it. I wouldn’t want to and I don’t think anyone would be really interested in listening to that either – not really.”Asked why she has chosen to take on something so raw and so close, Róisín tells me: “Well, it is something that keeps coming up in conversation. For me, it was a real compulsion to remember daddy, born out of a fear of forgetting him. I recorded him speaking when he was sick and those recordings have become the soundscape for this piece. His voice is very present in the piece. “I could just do this for myself and not show it to anyone. I could just write it all down and put it under my bed and that would be a part of my grief process. People can be in the same space and share what is a very universal, inevitable thing for every single human being.“I don’t think we as a society are really that great at dealing with grief. “There was a time I wanted to make myself a little badge saying, ‘I’m grieving, please be patient with me.’ Hopefully this piece is a good way for people to share and create conversation – some people might not want to talk and that’s fine. I think that the bottom line is about putting trust and faith in the universe, in nature and the hope and comfort that this is a cycle and we live on.I want people to feel comforted and feel hopeful in some way and I want them to see what I clung on to. Ultimately I want to do daddy justice.”• Natural Disaster is on at the MAC on March  and . Tickets for the play are priced at £.

We have received no offer from them as to what they would give us infor any changes.“It requires a change of approach from the UK government to understand that Brexit is a problem of their creation,” he said.In a speech today, Mrs May implored to the EU to give her legally-binding changes to the backstop ahead of a vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in parliament next Tuesday.She said “one more push” was needed to get MPs on board. However, at the same time she delivered a message to politicians in London, saying: \"Back it and the U.K. will leave the European Union.

The second half continued to be a feisty affair and a great spectacle for the neutral spectator.With the lowered sun in Ballynahinchrsquos eyes, Ballymena did the smart thing and constantly took the high router, creating numerous scoring opportunities for Ballymena.Unfortunately, for lsquoHinch, their lead didnrsquot last too long as Ballymena bounced back with another great counter-attacking goal to make it -.It was end-to-end stuff, like the first half, the best of the chances falling to Millar, McIlwaine and Campbell only to be denied by the hard-working Ballymena defence and lsquokeeper.Cards were shown to both sides with William Edgar, Andrew Mulholland and Tim Crean doing time on the sideline.Ballymena had decent short corner chances, but were closed down well by Ashley Brown, Rea Coffey and of course Aaron Donnell.lsquoHinch had a few shorts of their own, but couldnrsquot convert. With  minutes remaining on the clock, Ballynahinch patiently played the ball around the back, waiting for an opening.Ashley Brownrsquos pass then found the lurking Stuart Hunter in space. Hunter was able to pick out roaming right back Leslie Harrison, who pulled a perfect pass back into Millar and he made no mistake in finding the net.Ballynahinch could easily have sat back and closed up shop, but they pinned Ballymena into their own half with a series of concerted attacks.Congratulations to everyone involved with the Ballynahinch menrsquos team, especially the supporters who never miss a game.The celebrations were short-lived as Ballynahinch have a huge game this weekend when they face Portrush in Coleraine in the Irish Hockey Challenge semi-final at pm.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Andrew Mulholland , Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison, Matthew Martin, Stuart Hunter, William Edgar,Tim Crean, Jason Campbell, Alex Millar, Andrew McIlwaine, Luke Curry, Micheal Carney, Josh Higginson, Steven Crean.Joint men of the match: Alex Millar and Rea Coffey.Ballynahinch Ballymena ULSTER INTER LEAGUE.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"£2m tidal turbine providing energy spins in to action  ","story":"A poundm tidal turbine currently in Strangford Lough could provide electricity for between - homes, it has been revealed.The Scottish firm behind the innovative Subhub has said that energy produced from the fast-flowing lough could cost as low as p per kWH for local industrial load customers.However, the Subhub is not connected to the local electricity grid and is being tested for its environmental impact and maintenance needs.The distinctive yellow Subhub mdash which is roughly the size of of a bus mdash has been in Castleward Bay for the last six weeks.Easily seen from Portaferry, it was towed from Belfast Harbour and fixed into position within  hours on January .Jeremy Smith, managing director of QED Naval, said that Strangford Lough was chosen over the Orkneys for the Subhubrsquos final commissioning before being made available for the global market.Mr Smith explained: ldquoThe Subhub is a foundation structure for tidal turbines and provides a means of transporting and fixing tidal turbines to the sea bed.ldquoWe want to prove the environmental credentials of Subhub after developing it since .ldquoWe selected Strangford Lough as the commissioning site specically as it had the iants of conditions that Orkney hadnrsquot.

Lyng took the resultant penalty, but it was saved by a combination of Karen Haughey and then Sara-Louise Carr in the last action of the half.The second period followed a similar trend as Clonduff dominated the third quarter, Sara-Louise Carr banging over her third point and Gribben, who was picking up so much ball around the middle third, putting four between them once more from a placed ball.Gailltiacuter took over from then on, but will rue near-misses with shots for goal from Jackman, Carroll and Fitzgerald.The latter reduced the margin to the minimum with three scores, the third from play in the th minute after wonderful work by Kate Lynch, but crucially Gribben responded with a fantastic conversion of a free outside the  after a heavy challenge on Megan OrsquoReilly.Lyng made it a one-point game once more from a free, but Clonduff defended resolutely to hold out.Clonduff: K Haughey, N OrsquoHagan, J Boden, S Murphy, C McGilligan, E Rafferty, F Carr , B Fitzpatrick, C Cowan, C Fitzpatrick, SL Carr , P Gribben , O Gribben, K McGilligan.

In fact, the South Eastern Trust has been concentrating for some time on trying to find suitable day surgical services which could be delivered in Downpatrick.Miss Ritchie said it appears ldquovery short sighted to relocate services from the Downe to other hospitals, suggesting the bedding down of eye surgery will result in the increased requirement for theatre access for ENT and other services.She added: ldquoAs the Downe has high level computerised technology theatres, it is important that full use is made of them to ensure continued local accessibility to day surgery services at the point of delivery.ldquoI have already written to the Trust urging that ENT surgical clinics are retained in the Downe Hospital.Also this week, Miss Ritchie has issued a fresh call for a permanent MRI scanner to be installed in Downpatrick.She said that for a number of years the local community has been involved in trying to secure a permanent scanner which health chiefs agree is a necessity.She added: ldquoI understand that the permanent facility is subject to a business case which needs a Minister in place to approve. Whilst the devolved institutions remain in cold storage, the approval of such a facility will probably take some time.ldquoIn the meantime, a mobile scanner has been located at the Downe for a limited period to deal with a current overburdened service at the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald. I hope this unit can remain in place until the business case for the permanent scanner has been approved.A South Eastern Trust spokeswoman has confirmed that there are no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Food firm to create 125 jobs with £17m investment  ","story":"DOWNPATRICK is in line for a major jobs boost.Finnebrogue Artisan has this week unveiled plans to create  new jobs as part of a poundm investment in an ultra-modern nitrite-free bacon facility.The news comes just weeks after the firm unveiled details of a poundm investment in a new vegan and vegetarian factory to support  jobs.Already one of the districtrsquos leading employers and widely regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos most innovative food producers, Finnebrogue Artisanrsquos latest investment is being supported by Invest NI.The new manufacturing facility is for the production of the companyrsquos nitrite-free bacon, hailed by many experts as a breakthrough in the food processing sector when it was unveiled to wide acclaim in January last year.The Naked Bacon range is now widely available in leading supermarkets across the UK, with Invest NI offering the Downpatrick company over pound.m of support towards the capital investment in the new nitrate-free bacon facility.The  new posts are expected to be created by , supporting  posts already in place at the ultra-modern plant outside Downpatrick.Finnebrogue chairman Denis Lynn says it has been known for decades that nitrites used in curing meat can cause cancer.ldquoThatrsquos why, despite being the UKrsquos leading top tier sausage maker, we refused to make a single rasher of bacon until we could figure out a way to make it better and safer, he continued.ldquoWe always set out to make food the best it can be, without being bound by the way it has always been done.

The development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal and while planners have received  objections, they have also received five letters in support of the proposal.In papers submitted ahead of next weekrsquos meeting, planners confirm that none of the statutory consultees, including the Department for Infrastructure, Rivers Agency, Environment Agency and the local environmental health department, have lodged any objections to the redevelopment of the former school site.They confirm that roads officials are content that the proposed development will not have any ldquoadverse impact on the existing road infrastructure and is acceptable in terms of road safety.Planners are also insisting that the indicative designs of both the new store and mountain rescue centre would not be inappropriate in this part of the resort.They say it is acknowledged that there are ldquoobvious restrictions for the redevelopment of the existing Lidl store in Railway Street and there are no alternative vacant sites in the town centre which can accommodate the supermarketrsquos needs.ldquoA suitable brownfield site has become available at the edge of the town centre which could accommodate the proposal and has met the requirements of strategic planning policy, say planners.They also confirmed that a study of the impact of the new store on existing retailers shows the proposed investment will not have any ldquosignicant or unacceptable impact on Newcastle town centre.Environmental health officials say they have no objection in principle to the investment, provided conditions are attached restricting hours of business and deliveries, with planners concluding that the overall impact of the proposal, which is close to a number of homes, is not considered to be ldquosignicantly detrimental to warrant a refusal of the application.Lidl has confirmed it plans to develop a new , square metre supermarket, explaining it opted to redevelop the former primary school site as there are limited opportunities to redevelop the storersquos current base at Railway Street in the resort.Lidl says it has been looking for alternative premises in Newcastle town centre for over a decade without success and that while properties have become available, none were suitable because they were too small.It says the current sales area at its Railway Street base is is too small for the store to carry a full range of goods, pointing to narrow aisles with limited circulation space. The company says the car park is too small and fails to meet its requirements, with the general customer experience falling short of a modern food store.Planners say that having assessed the ious planning policies and having regard to all representations made, all consultees engaged and all other material considerations, it is found that the proposal is acceptable in planning terms and approval is recommended..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle’s pop up beach back on agenda of council  ","story":"A DECISION to reject a proposal for a pop-up beach in Newcastle has been overturned.Last month, a Newry, Mourne and Down Council Committee recommended not to proceed with the articial beach mdash similar to those in Paris and other parts of Europe ndash at the townrsquos promenade.However, the decision was overturned at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the full council when it was agreed to seek funding for the pop-up beach and develop a business case which could pave the way for its introduction.But not all councillors agreed, with Sinn Fein members rejecting it. They said there were health and safety concerns associated with the beach. They expressed support for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to Newcastle promenade and implementing an enhanced beach management plan.The radical suggestion to bring a touch of French summer flair to Newcastle was initially discussed last September when it was agreed to further explore the idea, with the initial focus on the cost of developing such a facility.The idea was suggested because of the lack of sand on Newcastle beach.Pop up beaches along the banks of the Seine and other cities and towns across Europe are hugely popular and some local politicians believe they can be a success in Newcastle.Council officials have confirmed that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be suitable and that the cost over a nine-week period would be pound,.At last monthrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, politicians rejected the pop-up proposal and agreed to seek a meeting with the Environment Agency to discuss securing a marine licence to transport sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle.It was also suggested that groins would be placed along sections of beach to protect the sand and a programme of better beach management introduced.

However, it is not workable.ldquoI have been advised in no uncertain terms by a iety of coastal erosion experts that importing sand to Newcastle or removing stones from the beach simply wonrsquot work due to the movement of sediment and that permission to do this work would be denied by central government.ldquoAs a councillor for Newcastle, I want to improve our tourism product and the pop-up beach proposal is simply my suggestion to try and do something dferent. I also recognise that an articial beach would have to be properly managed and maintained.Cllr Devlin added: ldquoA pop-up beach could not just be created at the start of the summer and left. It would have to be adequately cleaned and looked after. As a mother, I would not want my child playing in dirty sand so the management and cleanliness of the pop up beach is essential.ldquoThis suggestion wonrsquot be without itrsquos issues, but surely as a council it is our job to try and make improvements and better our area where possible, expressing disappointment Sinn Fein opposed her proposal.Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke argued that there was no appetite for a pop-up beach and that the suggestion to move sand from Ballykinlar to Newcastle was to replace the hundreds of tonnes which drt away on a seasonal basis.He continued: ldquoHow are you going to manage a pop-up beach that will be filled with stagnant sand  There is the potential for both dogs and young infants to foul the sand and other health and safety issues which need to be addressed.ldquoWill the sand be cleaned every day  What measures will be taken to prevent sand from blowing up Main Street  Local people and traders want to see a sandy beach, not a pop-up beach. I believe it is a no brainer that we try to secure Environment Agency agreement to place sand on the beach.Cllr Clarke said part of the pleasure of going to the beach was being able to go into the water and suggested that a pop-up beach could not provide such an experience.He added: ldquoWe need to look at anti-social behaviour issues associated with pop-up beaches which could contain broken glass.

Murray launched the ball high into orbit and wasnrsquot the least bit surprised when the wind took over and helped it on its way to the top right hand corner of the net with Ross clutching at thin air.Six minutes later at the other end Anton McGrattan struck yet another free kick from just outside the box past Ryan Walsh to bring the sides level.Olympic continued to see more of the ball, but Jones, when he did receive the ball out wide, was let down on a few occasions by a lack of support in the box and some wasteful finishing from Shane Murray.Kilmore were far from out of it and the bustling Joe McKinney was proving a handful and he almost gave the visitors a nd minute lead when he shot wide after a sizzling breakaway run from Anton McGrattan.Murray missed another good chance for Olympic after Jones carved out another opening before Kilmore seized the lead.Callum Dougan foraged deep and played a delightful through ball into the path of McKinney, who had beaten the offside trap. McKinney wasnrsquot for hanging around and after shrugging off Stevie McGoran, herounded lsquokeeper Walsh to make it -.The unrelenting wind and rain greeted both sets of players back for the second half and it was Kilmore who went on the offensive with Ryan Slavin being denied by Walsh.Two minutes later Kilmore shot themselves in the foot when Murray floated a free kick into the box and Jason Noade had all the time in the world to head the ball past Ross.Things became hot and heavy for a while with the tackles flying in, but clear cut chances at either end were hard to come by.Kilmore were now asking most of the questions, but a resolute Olympic rearguard refused to budge and Walsh had relatively little to do, apart from the odd shot from distance.Extra-time produced little of note, but Kilmore could have wrapped things up in the second period when McKinney crossed for Pete Casey, but, for once, he sliced his effort into no manrsquos land.Jones, Jason and Stevie Noadersquos first three penalties were perfect for Olympic, but they were matched by McGivern, McKinney and Larkin for Kilmore.Adam McLean nudged Olympic - ahead before Anton McGrattan fired his effort wide, advantage Olympic.Murrayrsquos first attempt was saved by Ross, but the referee made him retake the penalty as he insisted Ross had moved forward off his line. Murray was not about to look a gt horse in the mouth and drilled his second attempt to the net, much to the despair of a mightily aggrieved Kilmore side.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Aaron McClean, Jason Noade, Ryan Noade, Stevie McGoran, Stevie Noade, Ryan Molloy, Shane Murray, Niall Murray.

The backstop is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not open for re-negotiation.\"And French President Emmanuel Macron also said the agreement was \"not re-negotiable\", in comments just moments before MPs voted.The Commons approved a cross-party amendment, tabled by Midlands MPs Caroline Spelman and Jack Dromey, rejecting a no-deal Brexit by  to .The vote is not legally binding on the government but will impose massive political pressure on the prime minister to delay Brexit from its scheduled date of March she cannot secure a new deal from Brussels.The PM told MPs: \"I agree that we should not leave without a deal. However, simply opposing no-deal is not enough to stop it.\"The Government will now redouble its efforts to get a deal that this House can support.\"There was uproar in the chamber as she said: \"There is limited appetite for such a change in the EU and negotiating it will not be easy.

Dealing with this type of call prevents our staff from dealing with genuine emergencies.ldquoCalling an ambulance when you donrsquot need one wastes time and resources which could have been better spent responding someone genuinely in need of the high level clinical care ambulance crews provide. Ambulances are not a taxi service and arriving at hospital by ambulance does not mean yoursquoll be seen quicker.\"She added: ldquoIf someone is seriously ill or injured and their le is at risk, you should call  immediately. For those minor illnesses and injuries which are less serious, we hope Woody the dog helps people realise that there are other, more appropriate, services available. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Kelly has written to Dept. of Infrastructure.She said: “Large sections of the Cornakinnegar Road just past Tarry Lane and the Lurgan Road at the Goudy Bridge Road in Aghagallon, which links the village to Lurgan town centre and the later with the M motorway are in such a poor condition. “I understand that resources for road improvements are scarce however, the safety of motorists and cyclists must be a priority. Many motorists are now discouraged to drive on the right side of the road at these locations in order to prevent damage to their own vehicle.”“In reply to my letter, DFI assured me that these two sections are included on the list for resurfacing in the next financial year. SDLP Lurgan representative Ciaran Toman added, “A particular concern is one of safety for cyclists as motorists try to avoid the potholes and dropped gullies. These are very serious matters which must be addressed urgently.”“The local community know too well the deteriorating surface condition of the road and will be delighted to finally see these two locations resurfaced in the next financial year.” Fly tipping in Craigavon condemned Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"PORT | Article

Confirmation of their stance came in a letter leaked to the Lurgan Mail which said: “There is agreement and evidenced need for a change in provision on the Lurgan campus of Craigavon Senior High Schooland a recognition and need to make CSHS more coherent and educationally and financially viable. “CSSC welcomes the Education Authority’s assurance that the short term accommodation needs will be met in transferring to the single site and further welcomes the commitment to secure funding for major capital investment from the Department of Education in the next - years. “It is the view of CSSC that by addressing the educational, financial, and health and safety issues the school will be enabled to provide a safe educational setting, enhance the quality of educational provision, and move towards a more stable financial environment. “The recent appointment of a permanent principal along with a strong leadership and management team, and a Board of Governors which is committed to providing a quality educational experience, indicate that the school is well placed to manage any changes required. “CSSC is mindful of the strong community interest in this proposal and would request that all interests are given due consideration. “CSSC is of the opinion that the Education Authority, in identying its preferred option, has sought to: maintain the integrity of the Dickson Plan provide a Lurgan solution, had this been possible and secure a type of provision that is in the best interests of CSHS pupils.”“A strong desire was consistently expressed throughout the consultation process by all stakeholders that post- provision within CSHS is of critical importance in meeting the needs of the pupils who choose a non-selective pathway within the Dickson Plan and that the implementation of this should be accelerated. “In supporting the publication of a development proposal which would enable CSHS to operate on a single site, CSSC supports the need to accelerate the establishment of post- provision within the school. “Finally, CSSC would concur with the views of the vast majority of controlled schools in the area and acknowledges, should the proposal be approved, that: there is a clear need for suitable transport provision to be provided to ensure that the transfer of pupils to the new campus operates efficiently and effectively the appropriate accommodation is ready and fit for purpose when the transfer of pupils takes place any future development of a major capital programme will require careful consideration and appropriate consultation with regard to the site for a new school. “CSSC wishes to thank all of those involved in the controlled sector in the Craigavon area, for their participation and contributions to this complex process.” The CSSC was established in September  as an advocacy body for almost half of all schools in Northern Ireland. The body supports controlled schools, which are open to all faiths and none, in providing high quality education for children and young people to enable them to learn, develop and grow together, within the ethos of non-denominational Christian values and principles.Searches in Craigavon part of probe into dissident republican activity Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

How did you get started in the industry  When we first opened Asia Supermarket in , it was the family’s ambition to bring a taste of home to Belfast. We brought the Chinese culture to the local community through cuisine and provided authentic and tasty ingredients for the hospitality trade here. We branched out due to demand to also provide Indian, Korean, Philippine, Thai and Middle Eastern food and are always looking for opportunities to extend our range. Typically, who are your clients or customers  Our customers would be both wholesale and retail to include restaurants all over Northern Ireland, as well as consumers who want to create some unique dishes in their home kitchens. Do you enjoy what you do, and what in particular  Yes, and in particular having just completed the new build we have enjoyed being involved in the day-to-day aspects, given the bespoke nature of the project, coupled with the hustle and bustle of the day to day challenges of satisfying our customer needs. What is the most dficult part of your job  One of the most dficult parts of the job is sourcing good quality produce at competitive prices and enhancing the range of products available. However, we’re very proud of our new supermarket and warehouse which provides even more quality and choice for our customers. What are the challenges facing your sector, and the economy in general  One of the biggest challenges facing our sector is the cost of goods from our suppliers, particularly those procured in foreign currencies which in turn has a knock-on effect on what we charge our wholesale and retail customers. To maintain our share of the market we constantly endeavour to get the best prices from our suppliers so that we can pass on competitive prices to our customers to maintain and grow our market share. With Brexit looming it will bring a major impact on imports costs and supplier prices which will present a major challenge for our business.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/cleaver_1.jpg","title":"is the future bright for the ni energy market","story":"Posted on Tuesday  February  by Ulster Business It is clear that there are a number of signicant challenges facing the energy sector in Northern Ireland but where there are challenges, there are also opportunities, according to law firm Cleaver Fulton Rankin.The ExecutiveNorthern Ireland has just completed its second year without a ing local government and in the words of David Sterling, head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the Civil Service is “… doing everything we can in the prevailing circumstances…but civil servants cannot take the place of ministers when it comes to strategic policy development or in taking transformative decisions”.  This is very much the case with regard to energy policy. The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

The proposal for the work to Broadcasting House on Ormeau Avenue in Belfast was approved last March by the BBC board, with the announcement made to staff by the BBCs director general Lord Tony Hall. Now, the plans – which include the redevelopment of the exisiting BBC Broadcasting House building, including the refurbishment and extension of the buildings – will be put to the public, as part of a necessary pre-application event before planning can be submitted. It includes a new extension to the rear, including a landscaped plaza opening onto Linenhall Street. A spokesman for BBC Northern Ireland told Ulster Business: \"As part of the pre-planning application process, public consultation events will take place this month before we can move on to the next phase. The investment to BBC Broadcasting House in Belfast, announced in March last year, will transform the iconic building, its technology and facilities, highlighting the BBC’s commitment to audiences in Northern Ireland. We will share more detail in due course.\" Money invested will go towards structural work on the -year-old building to ensure its long-term sustainability, addressing what the state broadcaster has said are \"critical deficiencies\". Before the announcement last year that the BBC was to stay put and develop its existing building, it was understood the broadcaster had been eyeing up other city centre locations, or could create a new media hub in the Titanic Quarter. The event will take place at the Clayton Hotel on March , between pm and pm, and March  between pm and .pm.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pin_1.jpg","title":"pinnacle given top sage accolade","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business IT firm Pinnacle has been awarded a top accolade for its Sage software and services in Ireland.The company, which has offices across the UK and Ireland including Belfast and Dublin, has been named by Sage Ireland as its ‘highest growth partner’ for sales of Sage cloud.Search Workshop Supplies, one of Ireland’s largest suppliers of garage and workshop equipment, is one of the latest firms which has partnered with Pinnacle.Olivia O’Dea of Search Workshop Supplies, said: “From our initial meeting with Pinnacle’s business development director Siobhan Marley, we were given a solid reassurance that Pinnacle fully understood the growing needs of our business.”Barry Murphy, managing director of Sage Ireland, said:“The team at Pinnacle are incredibly passionate in supporting their customers to thrive in an ever-evolving market.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.
