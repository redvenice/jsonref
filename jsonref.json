I know it is my mum. She has been taken from us in a terrible way.’         British IT director Lorraine Campbell, 55, from Manchester, was the eighth British victim killed in the atrocities to be namedShe was last seen alive on CCTV footage having breakfast with colleague Juno Srivastava at the hotel’s Taprobane restaurant - where she was said to have been sat ‘very close’ to the blast site.The successful businesswoman had relocated to Dubai to work for a large firm last year with her husband Neil Evans who has flown to Sri Lanka to try to find her.A suicide bomber - who had checked into the hotel the night before the attack as Mohamed Azzam Mohamed - had waited patiently in line at the breakfast buffet with a plate in hand.An employee at the hotel, who had reviewed CCTV footage, said: ‘He had a couple of servings before he came right to the centre of the restaurant and blew himself up.’Dhivya Marunthiah, who is a volunteer helping in the search for missing people, said: ‘Both Juno and Lorraine were sat very close to the blast area.‘Footage from inside the hotel shows them having breakfast together near to where the bomb was detonated in the moments before.‘We have been looking for Lorraine and Juno for two days.’       Mr Campbell, who lives in Stalybridge, Manchester, said his mother had been anxious about travelling to the island ahead of her fateful visit.He said: ‘She had messaged me before the trip to say she was nervous about flying there because of Dengue fever.‘She was quite worked up about it but I told her she would be all right. I never thought something like this could happen.‘Mum was amazing. She touched everyone she met and all those people now have a huge hole in their lives.’ He added: ‘I saw her only a couple of weeks ago when she came back for Mother’s Day which was really nice.‘She had only been in Sri Lanka for a day for work. I think her company had some dealers or suppliers she needed to meet.’Mrs Campbell, who married husband Neil in Liverpool last February, had been with Mr Srivastava a ‘loyal friend’ who works for her at Al Futtaim - a firm which runs malls across the Middle East.The Indian national - who also lives in Dubai and is a lecturer at Middlesex University’s Dubai campus - was still missing last night.Mr Campbell said his mother remarried in February last year after finding ‘everything she ever wanted’ in business man Neil.‘Mum never thought she would get married again but she met Neil who was everything she wanted in a man - smart, intellectual and successful in his own right.‘He gave up his business career here to start a new life in Dubai with Mum. They had a three year plan to make some money tax free and then come home to enjoy life,’ he said.Mr Campbell, who works in music management, said: ‘Mum was a strong woman.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe There are no ifs, buts or maybes: full consideration will be given to abolishing controversial two-tier pay scales for teachers, Minister for Education Joe McHugh has said.But speaking at the annual conference of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland (ASTI) in Wexford, he said he could not give a timescale for this process to take place. Mr McHugh’s comments came after conflicting signals from the Government on how far it is willing to go to tackle the legacy of the two-tier pay system, introduced eight years ago.On Monday, a joint Government-ASTI statement indicated that remaining issues on new entrant pay would be given “full consideration”. This would happen either as part of a new pay review in the public service or as part of talks on a successor to the existing overall public service pay agreement.This represents a shift in Government policy which, up until this week, insisted that the two-tier pay issue had been fully addressed. But on Tuesday morning the Department of Public Expenditure downplayed the immediate prospect of a new initiative to end two-tier pay in the public service.It maintained that the text it agreed with unions stated that outstanding issues relating to the lower-pay arrangements for staff taken on since 2010 “may” be examined by any pay process put in place ahead of talks on a successor agreement should that situation arise. In its statement, the department wrote the word “may” in capital letters for emphasis.Contentious issueOn Tuesday evening, Mr McHugh said there was now a wording agreed and a commitment that either talks on the recent-entrant pay issue will begin through a review mechanism – whatever they may look like – or in future negotiations.Mr McHugh said the Public Service Pay Commission had suggested last autumn that at some stage there could be a more general examination of the adequacy of current pay arrangements.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) was also sticking by its position that an end is now in sight to two-tier pay scales following the shift in Government policy.General secretary Sheila Nunan said: “We are operating off the text that was agreed between parties to the Public Service Stability Agreement. The text is the text and that’s the basis on which the INTO will be engaging.”Delegates at the INTO congress in Galway and at the ASTI conference overwhelmingly backed motions on Tuesday calling for an end to the two-tier system in the next round of pay negotiations.Mr McHugh also said the Department of Education will engage “in a constructive way” on the impact of financial penalties imposed by the Government on members of the ASTI following industrial action nearly three years ago . This issue has become highly controversial in the union in recent months after the Government decided not to apply similar sanctions on nurses after their strike earlier this year."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869336.1556030110!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"overworked school leaders are chasing mice and unblocking toilets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDelegates said a lack of time, increasing demands of the role were barriers to effective leadership. Photograph: iStockSchool leaders’ rising workloads mean they are spending much of their time “chasing mice, unblocking toilets and organising table quizzes ”, a teachers’ conference has heard.Delegates at the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s (INTO) annual congress said conditions of employment for principals and their deputies have increased exponentially in recent years.Many said they were now struggling to ensure new initiatives, policies and paperwork are being implemented in full.Daithi Ryder, deputy principal of a two-teacher school in Co Mayo, won warm applause and a standing ovation from delegates after providing an exhaustive list of his duties, which he described as the “two-teacher tango.”“Roll books, teaching music, drama, sifting through the rainforest of mail every day, collecting milk and photo monies, preparing children for sacraments and the annual mass, table quizzes, raffles, 74.5 hours doing yard duty, including chasing stray dogs from the yard with a ruler and cleaning up after lost heifers... chasing mice and unblocking toilets,” he said. “How do I do it all? Look at my hair!”Delegates said a lack of time, increasing demands of the role, as well as insufficient in-school middle management teams, were barriers to effective leadership.School leaders called on the Department of Education to decrease the threshold for the appointment of administrative deputy principals.In addition, they called for an increase in supports for boards of management to enable them carry out their duties.Teaching principals also re-stated their call for a minimum of one day a week of “release time” to allow them to complete administrative duties as they try to balance their duties of full-time teacher and principal.School leaders further demanded that an outstanding 2008 pay award made to principals and deputy principals, which was never paid, be addressed as a priority ahead of any further pay talks.Positive workDelegates at congress also supported a motion highlighting a “clear pathway which will achieve pay equality for all teachers”, a reference to those hired after 2011 on lower payscales.Union members said they recognised positive work that has been done to advance the issue to date but said these measures fell well short of pay equality.Joe McKeown, of the union’s central executive committee, said: “There should be no doubt in anyone’s mind, however, that as far as we are concerned, the only resolution to pay inequality is the restoration of pay equality for all teachers. That day can’t come soon enough.”Minister for Education Joe McHugh earlier in the day pledged that moves to abolish two-tier pay scales for teachers will be given “full consideration” by the Government.Mr McHugh acknowledged issues of “outstanding concern” would be considered either in the context of a pay review or the next pay deal.Responding, the INTO’s incoming general secretary John Boyle said that while it was heartening to hear the Minister accept there was “unfinished business” on pay inequality, he said pay inequality must end in the next public service pay deal."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869648.1556048136!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers call for sick leave after miscarriages","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJosephine Byrne, a primary teacher in Edenderry, says leave should be available for anyone who suffers a miscarriage. Photograph: Carl O’BrienPrimary school teachers are calling for leave to be available to them if they suffer a miscarriage.Reproductive-health related issues such as miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies and fertility treatment are not included under the current sick leave scheme for public sector workers.Josephine Byrne, a teacher based in Edenderry, Co Offaly said she felt compelled to go back to work after a miscarriage despite feeling “broken”.“In the middle of June our world came crashing down around us. I was 10 weeks pregnant when I started to bleed. A trip to the early pregnancy unit in Ballinasloe confirmed our worst fears: the baby had stopped developing at seven weeks and I’d had what is termed a missed miscarriage,” she said.She was among teachers to tell their highly-personal stories on reproductive health at the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation’s (INTO) annual congress in Galway.‘I was broken’Ms Byrne said she received a very sympathetic response from her principal who was “beyond supportive” and urged her to take as much time off as she needed.However, after being at home for a few days waiting for things to progress, she began to worry about using up her sick leave.This was because pregnancy-related sick certificates can currently only be issued by GPs for issues arising in later pregnancy.“Instead of minding myself and grieving with my husband over our lost child, I was stressing about using up all of my sick leave,” she said.After she underwent a hospital procedure on a Friday, she returned to work the following Monday.“At the time we were living an hour away from school and I cried the whole hour-long journey from Edenderry. I wasn’t ready to go back to school. I was broken.”While Ms Byrne became pregnant again, she found out she had a second miscarriage at the end of the following August.“I was devastated and barely functioning but guess what I did on September 1st? Yes, I went to school. Why did I do that? Because I was worried about using up even more sick leave. The worry and stress over sick leave was like a noose around my neck at the time,” she said.Ms Byrne said separate reproductive health leave is needed to those recovering from miscarriage, ectopic pregnancies and fertility treatment,“Fertility treatment, scans for possible difficulties, difficulties with IVF should all be covered,”she said.“A lot of teachers still feel slightly uncomfortable about speaking to a principal about such issues,” she said, and a certificate would “respect this privacy”.IVFAt the union’s annual congress on Tuesday, members backed a motion calling for statutory time off work for reproductive health matters.It is first public service union to seek such statutory leave for reproductive health matters.Ms Byrne said that she had subsequently become pregnant, and gave birth to twins six months ago.“I know that I am now one of the lucky ones. We need to support others to end the stress that many of our colleagues go through when using sick leave for reproductive health matters,” she said.She said IVF was only going to become a “bigger issue”, and she welcomed the fact that the INTO had “opened up the conversation on this”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869556.1556039818!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"funicular and driverless shuttle in proposed phoenix park revamp","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access. Photograph: Pat LanganDublin’s Phoenix Park is facing its most significant change in decades, with plans for new visitor attractions including a funicular, a driverless shuttle-bus, and a train station, proposed by the Office of Public Works (OPW).The OPW wants to capitalise on the park’s existing attractions, such as Dublin Zoo, the Ashtown Demense and the Magazine Fort, along with developing new facilities to attract more visitors and improve access.It also wants to reduce the dominance of car traffic in the park which is “not appropriate, nor indeed safe” and has a “significant negative impact on the amenity value of the park”, but it is careful not to propose curbs.The Phoenix Park Visitor Experience Strategic Review, which is open for public consultation until Friday, April 26th, ides the park into five different areas.The entrance at Parkgate Street is described as the “welcome quarter” the area around the zoo and Ashtown Demesne as “activity quarter” while the west end near Farmleigh has been termed as the “bioersity quarter”.Meanwhlie, the Magazine Fort in the south of the park is branded as the “commemorative quarter” while Chesterfield Avenue, the long straight road bisecting the park has been called the “central line”.Two “welcome pavilions” have been proposed for the Parkgate Street entrance to serve as visitor information centres and “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle” the OPW said.The main visitor centre would be at the Ashtown Demesne, where the current cafe could be redeveloped as a children’s education centre, and a larger cafe, toilet facilities and visitor centre would be built, as well as the possibility for extensive “discrete” car parking facilities.The zoo entrance facilities could also be expanded, and the tea rooms and bandstand near the zoo could be upgraded. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line which runs from Heuston Station could also be located to the east of the zoo.The bioersity quarter, which takes in Fury Glen and the White Fields at the west end of the park would see the least intervention, but there could be scope for development of the existing pavilion near the Knockmaroon gate as a bioersity centre. It could be “tripled in size” without being over developed the OPW said. Toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised barbecue” space could be located here. Barbecues are currently banned in the park.The biggest changes are likely to be seen in the commemorative quarter focused on the Magazine Fort. This old military structure could be refurbished with exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, but could also incorporate a funicular which would run to the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge on the other side of the river Liffey.The central spine of Chesterfield Avenue could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions. However its principal function would be to act as a public transport route to discourage people from taking cars into the park. The OPW proposes a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. Such a system which was “almost science fiction a relatively short time ago has now become a readily achievable reality” it said.While the OPW does suggest new parking areas, it is keen to reduce through traffic and “tame” the use of the park for commuter parking it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869197.1556029977!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government plays down immediate end to two tier pay in public sector","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Government says there is “no comitment to address issues outside the pay agreement at this stage”. File photograph: PAThe Department of Public Expenditure has played down the immediate prospect of a new initiative to end the controversial two -tier pay system in the public service.On Monday a joint statement agreed between the Government and trade union said issues of outstanding concern in this area would be given full consideration either in a new pay review mechanism agreed by the parties or in the context of the next round of pay talks.Talks on a successor to the current public service accord are not expected to get under way for about a year while the Government has never publicly given any indication that it would agree to any general pay review mechanism before then.On foot of queries about the statement the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform said on Tuesday the text it had agreed with teaching unions said that outstanding issues relating to the lower-pay arrangements for staff taken on since 2010 “may” be examined by any pay process put in place ahead of talks on a successor agreement should that situation arise.The department said the Public Service Pay Commission in a report on recruitment and retention difficulties in the health service last August suggested a pay review could be established.Minister for Education Joe McHugh earlier pledged that moves to abolish two-tier pay scales for teachers would be given “full consideration” by the Government over the coming months.In a speech to the annual congress of the Irish National Teachers’ Organisation in Galway, Mr McHugh acknowledged there was “unfinished business” and issues of “outstanding concern” that remain to be addressed.Teachers’ unions argue that those hired since 2011 continue to face financial losses over the course of their careers compared with their longer-serving colleagues. Mr McHugh said that, on foot of the statement agreed between the Government and public sector unions on Monday, that these issues would be given “full consideration” in either an upcoming pay review or in the context of the new round of pay talks.Secondary teachersMeanwhile delegates at the annual conference of the secondary teachers’ union, the ASTI in Wexford, unanimously backed a motion calling for the union to work with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) to ensure the Governmen committed to the principle of equal pay for equal work and put in place a timetable for the ending of the existing two-tier system, t in the next round of pay negotiations.Wexford delegate Mary Cullen said she qualified in 2011 and due to the lower pay rates for teachers appointed after since that time she had lost out on €30,000 in earnings over the last six years.She said she worked side-by-side with people who had the same qualifications in the same subjects but who qualified a few months before her and were earning much more money. “It is just not fair”, she saidShe said pay parity needed to be secured now and not in 2020 .Miriam Duggan from Dublin said she older teachers did not betray their younger colleagues by accepting the introduction of lower pay rates.“We never discussed it, we never voted for it. We would never accept it as it breached a fundamental principle of equal pay for equal work.”She said she wanted to explode the myth that longer-serving teachers accepted the two-tier system to protect their gold -plated pensions.Susie Hall from Dublin North East said she hoped the Government did not have a plan to wring a whole plethora of concessions in return for the restoration of equal pay. “Do not go down that route”, she said.She said if the Government wanted to commit to the principle of equal pay it could do so today and there was no further discussion required.Ed Byrne from Fingal in Dublin said he had been at the national public service talks in 2017 and found that the large unions in Ictu cared little for the issue of equal pay for equal work.He said he had not heard a great deal in the interim to suggest that this position had changed.He said the current pay agreement in the public service lasted until the start of 2021. He said an issue as fundamental as equal pay for equal work could not be put on the long finger and left until the next pay deal.Richard Bell of Galway read a letter to the conference written by a teaching colleague who was scheduled to attend as a delegate but could not do so as she needed to earn extra money over the Easter holidays as her car insurance and rent were due in the same week next month and her salary would not cover the costs.The teacher in the letter read to the conference said she now had the worst paid job since she was a babysitting at age 15.The teacher said she was at the whim of management to see if she could top -up her hours by carrying out substitution work. The teacher said she sat in the staff room with colleagues , hoping that some might get ill enough to take two days off which could mean that she would secure a couple of extra hours work.

RSA\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe RSA said the Clancy Amendment has led to a 30 per cent increase in driving test bookings. Photograph: Matt KavanaghMore than 120,000 learner permit holders who obtained their first licence between 1984 and 2016 have never taken a driving test, new figures show.The Road Safety Authority (RSA) said the 125,860 learner permits issued between 2016 and 1984 remain active, meaning they are being renewed every year.Under the current rules a driver can renew their learner permit once they have booked a driving test. They do not need to provide proof of having sat the test and there is no legal requirement for a learner driver to take one.The issue also partly explains the proportion of drivers who fail to show up for their test, with an RSA spokesman saying about 10 per cent of applicants, up to 500 a week, fail to attend.The RSA said while longer waits for a driving test were an issue for some drivers between 2016 and last year, the average waiting time nationally now stands at 8.4 weeks, following the hiring of additional testers.The figures were released by the RSA following a Freedom of Information request from The  and cover the time period from 1980.The authority said the recent Clancy Amendment – which introduced penalties for learners who drive unaccompanied – has led to a 30 per cent increase in driving test bookings. It believes the legal change will see the number of long-term learner permit holders gradually fall.‘Gaming the system’Minister for Transport Shane Ross said the practice of “rolling over” a licence for many years and booking but not sitting a driving test is a significant problem and not sustainable. He accused those doing so of “gaming the system”.Mr Ross said the ability of drivers to renew a learner permit over decades should be gradually removed. He stressed that once a learner permit holder was accompanied by a fully licensed driver – even if they had been driving for many years without taking a test – they were not breaking the law.A number of proposals to address the issue are being considered by the Department of Transport, including increasing the cost of a learner permit, reducing the length of a learner permit renewed without a driving test from 12 months to six months, or obliging a driver to secure driving lessons before they can renew their learner permit.The 125,860 learner permits covers all vehicles classes and also includes drivers who may hold a full licence for one category of vehicle and a learner permit for another. The category B licence, which is for a car, is by far the largest licence category. The 125,860 excludes the 94,000 drivers who obtained a learner permit between 2017 and this year as this is their first such licence.The RSA has been aware for years that some drivers were constantly ‘rolling’ their licence. In the current Road Safety Strategy (2013-2020) there is an action stating the need to “reduce long-term reliance on multiple learner permits by introducing measures to ensure that learners sit a driving test before they can obtain a subsequent permit.”The date for this task was the end of 2014 – since revised to the end of 2018 – but it remains incomplete. A midterm review of the strategy, published at the end of 2016, said the solution to the issue was to “make it mandatory to sit a driving test before renewal of learner permit is granted”.Susan Gray, founder of road safety group Parc, asked how the RSA could justify taking more than five years to address an issue identified in 2013. She said: “When are they going to get their act together and do their job properly?”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869623.1556046786!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"teachers seeking pensions upgrade for those appointed since 2013","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn actuarial review published by the Government in December 2017 maintained that the State overall had an accrued liability of about €114.5bn in respect of retirement benefits.  Teachers are urging the Government to upgrade pension arrangements for those appointed in recent years.Unions maintain that changes introduced in 2013 by the Government mean there has been “substantial deterioration” in pension benefits for teachers appointed since that time.The move will essentially open up a new front in the debate over equality between recent entrants to teaching and longer-established colleagues.The unions’ calls are likely to be to be resisted strongly by the Government given that changes introduced in 2013 are aimed at generating savings of billions of euro in pension costs in the decades to come.The Irish National Teachers’ Organisation (INTO) at its conference in Galway said all three teaching unions would be seeking an immediate pension scheme review for teachers appointed in recent years.“Teachers have always paid for, and continue to pay for, their pension schemes through deferred income payments. This deferred pay ensures teachers have an income to sustain them in retirement. Teachers are paying more into their pensions than ever before due to the permanent additional superannuation contribution which came in under the Public Service Stability Agreement. This means teachers are now paying up to 17 per cent of earnings towards their retirement. However, the entitlements under the career average pension scheme have been diluted considerably.” The INTO said a new scheme introduced in2013, which means benefits are linked to career average payments, “eroded the value of teachers’ pensions”.The general secretary of the Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland, Kieran Christie, said those who entered teaching since 2013 were “paying a similar amount into their pension as their teacher colleagues (who entered the profession earlier), but their pension benefits are significantly inferior”.The Government believes the changes introduced at that time will make the State’s multibillion public service pension bill more sustainable over time.What are the pension schemes? An actuarial review published by the Government in December 2017 maintained that the State overall had an accrued liability of about €114.5 billion in respect of retirement benefits for current and former public service employees which it will have to meet in the decades ahead.Minister for Public Expenditure Paschal Donohoe said at the time that the Single Public Service Pension Scheme introduced from 2013 “will, in time, reduce liabilities by around 35 per cent from what would otherwise have been the case”. The pension schemes available to public service personnel recruited since 2013 and those in place before then are defined benefit – offering certainty to the amounts the employee will receive in retirement. However, under the 2013 scheme the pension benefit is based on average earnings over their career, not final salary prior to retirement. At the same time pension increases under the 2013 scheme are calculated in line with the consumer price index, not on pay rises awarded to those still in employment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3869527.1556042515!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"birds of a feather two new species discovered by trinity zoologists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Wangi-wangi white-eye (left) and the Wakatobi white-eye (right) are very different species. Photograph: Nicola Marples and David Kelly Two new bird species have been discovered by zoologists from Trinity College Dublin while on research trips to the Indonesian islands.The Wakatobi white-eye and the Wangi-wangi white-eye birds may have been found by the Irish team on islands close to each other but they are very different species.Details of their discovery on the Wakatobi Archipelago of Sulawesi in Indonesia are published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, the journal in which Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace published their game-changing original ideas about the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species in 1858.Precisely defining what a species is and how species arise has intrigued scientists for centuries, explained TCD professor of zoology Nicola Marples, “and while we may feel we intuitively know what a species is, the closer we look, the more complicated things become.”“Even if we accept the complications inherent in the definition of species, there is still so much we have to learn about how new species arise. Thinkers from Aristotle to Charles Darwin and onwards have spent their lives working to understand this topic,” she added.Since 1999, her group has been studying birds on Sulawesi, known for its weird and wonderful plants and animals, and its offshore islands. Using a new research approach, and working with partners from Halu Oleo University and Operation Wallacea, they combined genetic, body size and song indicators as a means of comparing organisms.“Differences in bird song are particularly important as birds use their songs to find their mates if separated populations of birds sing different songs, they won’t interbreed, which enables them to evolve in different directions,” Prof Marples said.White-eyes as a group have spread and speciated more rapidly than any other birds. They are adaptable, feeding on a wide variety of fruits, flowers and insects.The Wakatobi white-eye is found throughout the Wakatobi Islands and split from its mainland relatives in the past 800,000 years, while the Wangi-wangi white-eye is a much older species found on only one tiny island. “While this is an incredible discovery, living on only one tiny island means the Wangi-wangi white-eye is very vulnerable to habitat loss,” Prof Marples said.“To find two new species from the same genus of birds in the same island is remarkable. The Wangi-wangi white-eye is a particularly special discovery, as it is found on only one tiny island and its closest relatives live more than 3,000 km away,” she added.“These discoveries are not just of evolutionary interest – they will also be of real conservation relevance.” said lead author Dr Darren O’Connell of TCD, who is now working at UCD.By highlighting unique species special to the Wakatobi Islands they could help safeguard remaining habitats, which are under huge pressure. “We ultimately hope to have the islands recognised as an endemic bird area so they receive more conservation support.”"},{"url":null,"title":"notre dame ablaze pictures","story":"A huge fire has consumed Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris.Officials in Paris said the fire, which started around 7pm local time, could be linked to renovation works being carried out at the cathedral. French media reports, citing police sources, added that the fire started by accident. Cans of \u0026#39air of an outgoing era\u0026#39 go on sale in Japan for £7.50 ahead of new emperorLyra Mckee\u0026#39s family pay tribute to \u0026#39gentle innocent soul\u0026#39 ahead of funeral for murdered journalist Hugging and kissing at work should be banned, employees say, as survey reveals social \u0026#34minefield\u0026#34 of greetingsStanding on long rail journeys to be banned under Virgin Trains plan for airline-style faresHancock: NHS must adopt new technology or it will not survive Up to a third of child sex abuse images online are self generated as more children live stream, says internet watchdogKim Jong-un heads to Russia for first meeting with Putin\u0026#39Marsquake\u0026#39 detected for first time, Nasa saysPrince Harry shows support for transgender children as controversial charity invited to mental health talksTheresa May defies security warnings of ministers and US to allow Huawei to help build Britain\u0026#39s 5G network Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate: \u0026#39I\u0026#39ve entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

met oppositionrubana huq first female chief bangladesh","story":"Rubana Huq, managing director of one of Bangladesh\u0026#39s largest conglomerates One of Bangladesh\u0027s foremost female business leaders has vowed to transform job opportunities for women.Rubana Huq – managing director of one of the country’s largest conglomerates – became the first female president of Bangladesh’s national garment workers’ association earlier this month.Despite fierce resistance to her appointment from men in the industry, the pioneering 55-year-old has revealed ambitious plans to tackle female empowerment in the workplace.There are about 4,400 garment factories in Bangladesh, producing clothes for British high street retailers like Topshop, Primark and Marks \u0026amp Spencer. The industry dominates the economy, generating $28.14 billion in 2016-2016 – a figure that represented a staggering 70 per cent the country\u0027s entire export earnings. However, only 150 of these factories are owned by women. Men typically hold the middle management and leadership positions while women – who make up 80 per cent of the workforce – work on the factory floors. It is an imbalance that Huq is keen to address.“I walked into one of our factories a couple of years ago and I asked why do I only see male supervisors, where are the female supervisors?” the association president told The , in her first interview since her ground-breaking appointment earlier this month.“They said, Madam, they don’t want to become supervisors because it’s a lot of responsibility. So, I went down to the factory floor and said how many of you want to be supervisors and nearly all of them raised their hands.”The offices of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters AssociationIt is an attitude Huq is all too familiar with, for her appointment as president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association has been met with a “lot of opposition.”Opposition has not come from those who question whether she possesses the necessary experience after all Huq is the managing director and chairman of the Mohammadi Group, which owns lingerie, sweater and woven garments factories all over Bangladesh and employs some four million people. Instead, socially conservative and radical Islamic groups disapprove of women in Bangladesh being allowed to work at all, let alone occupy leadership roles.“Whether the pressure is going to be worth taking, I don’t know, but I want to set a standard for women and tell them that anything is possible,” Huq said.She has already established herself as the standard-bearer for improving working conditions for women in Bangladesh’s garment factories.In 2014, she set up a ground-breaking two-year access course and undergraduate degree for women working in factories at the Asian University for Women in Chittagong. The first cohort will graduate in 2020 and enter into leadership roles in factories.A fire in an illegally-constructed high-rise office building killed at least 25 people and left dozens more injured in Dhaka earlier this month. Safety concerns in the work place are at the top of Huq\u0026#39s agenda“When people ask me if I am excited about my presidency I’m actually not,” Huq said. “I’m more excited about watching the first garment workers graduate next year. For me, that is going to be some moment.”The new president, elected by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association in early April, now plans to introduce several other policies to transform employment opportunities for women in the garment industry.Her experience with the Mohammadi Group led her to conclude that “every second house” in Bangladesh possesses a woman producing textiles.Huq argued that these freelance designers are ultimately held back from expanding their businesses by a lack of capital.“Our Central Bank has a rule that at least 10 per cent of credit has to be given to women but in reality it is something like two to three per cent,” she explained.The president plans to introduce a National Credit Portal, so that entrepreneurial women can directly connect with banks to obtain necessary loans.She will also introduce a female-to-female mentorship scheme in Bangladesh so the nation’s scarce but growing network of businesswomen can inspire and advise others.While female employment rates have improved – from four per cent in 1974 to 33.9 per cent in 2015 – she admits the country still has a long way to go.“The quest is to find a way to re-skill and upskill women and I don’t know whether it will be possible in such a short time, but I believe the journey must begin,” she said.But as well as female empowerment, safety concerns are at the top of Huq\u0027s agenda. In 2013, when the Rana Plaza building in Dhaka collapsed killing more than 1,100 people, many of the dead were crushed as they worked in the building’s garment factories.Bangladeshi rescue workers search for survivors amid the rubble of the collapsed Rana Plaza building in 2013The horrifying incident shone a light on adverse working conditions in Bangladesh and as a result international firms with factories in the country agreed to sign the Accord on Fire and Building Safety.In accordance with the Bangladeshi government, the agreement permitted regular independent inspections in factories and a range of safety upgrades for workers.Accidents still occur, but they do so less frequently. According to a report by New York University\u0027s Stern Centre, 71 workers died annually in Bangladeshi factories before the Rana Plaza incident. Since the Accord was signed, that figure has fallen to 17. But the continued presence of Accord safety inspectors in Bangladesh is under threat. Representatives were due to leave the country in November 2018, but filed a petition to extend their presence. The Supreme Court will decide the outcome on May 19.According to Huq, the Accord’s presence has been very positive, but she believes that the organisation should now make “a graceful exit from Bangladesh.”Instead, the president intends to set up her own monitoring practices following a consultation with Accord representatives to understand remaining safety issues.“They can then move on to other countries in the region like India or Pakistan,” she argued. “These places also have similar accidents but Bangladesh is always hogging the spotlight and I don’t think that is fair.”Huq said the industry has worked hard to improve factory safety, under the terms of the Accord, but added that more can still be done.“The Accord had around 1,900 factories under its jurisdiction, my point is what happens to the rest,” she said.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleHuq added that there must be greater transparency inside the 745 factories currently under government control, as well as other small, shared facilities which fell outside the Accord\u0027s authority.She said an incident in one of these less visible factories could spook investors across the entire Bangladesh garment industry.“If there are isolated cases we should be able to deal with them instead of someone picking that story up and turning it into a huge headline,” Huq said. “That is not how we want to become a headline. I want to hit the headlines with a good story of how this sector is positively impacting women in Bangladesh.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Cans of \u0026#39air of an outgoing era\u0026#39 go on sale in Japan for £7.50 ahead of new emperorLyra Mckee\u0026#39s family pay tribute to \u0026#39gentle innocent soul\u0026#39 ahead of funeral for murdered journalist Hugging and kissing at work should be banned, employees say, as survey reveals social \u0026#34minefield\u0026#34 of greetingsHancock: NHS must adopt new technology or it will not survive Standing on long rail journeys to be banned under Virgin Trains plan for airline-style faresUp to a third of child sex abuse images online are self generated as more children live stream, says internet watchdogKim Jong-un heads to Russia for first meeting with Putin\u0026#39Marsquake\u0026#39 detected for first time, Nasa saysPrince Harry shows support for transgender children as controversial charity invited to mental health talksTheresa May defies security warnings of ministers and US to allow Huawei to help build Britain\u0026#39s 5G network Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate: \u0026#39I\u0026#39ve entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/23/TELEMMGLPICT000194957190_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"goat true morocco tourist site goats climb tree exploitative","story":"It seemed too good to be true. Visitors to Morocco have long flocked to the roads outside Marrakech to take photographs of goats who climbed into the low boughs of the Argania tree. Such pictures are widely shared on social media and often decorate the pages of guide books to Morocco. But an investigation by Aaron Gekoski, a British environmentalist photographer, has uncovered that the tourist destination seems to be an exploitative scam. Local farmers appear to be bringing the goats in from other areas and forcing them into the trees before charging tourists to take photographs of them. When the goats eventually tire from balancing on the tree branches they are brought down and new goats are swapped in. Campaigners claim an iconic tourist photo destination where dozens of goats perch in trees has been uncovered as an exploitative scam.After seeing tourists\u0027 interest in the tree-dwelling goats, some opportunistic farmers decide to manipulate the situation for financial gain,” said Mr Gekoski. I heard they even brought goats in from other areas, built platforms in the trees and now cajole the goats into the trees, charging tourists to take photographs.They will take the goats home in the late afternoon, before coaxing them back into the trees at sunrise.The goats are incredibly nimble and dextrous when it comes to navigating the trees, though generally they just stand in one place, looking rather sick and forlorn.All the tourists who visited seemed blissfully unaware though and \u0027oohed\u0027 and \u0027ahhed\u0027 before taking photos and selfies.”Mr Gekoski has hosted a number of environmental television programmes and is currently working on a campaign to end cruel wildlife tourism attractions. The Morocco investigation was part of that work. He said: The goats are often rotated halfway through the day as they get tired.Opportunistic farmers brought goats in from other areas and forced them into the trees before charging travellersIt\u0027s incredibly hot work standing in a tree all day and generally the goats are in poor condition and very skinny.There were also almost no older goats, which I heard get eaten.The farmers will also hand over young goats, known as kids, for photo opportunities in front of the trees.Also, having so many goats in one place threatens the sustainability of the trees as their hooves damage the branches.Elsewhere in Morocco, women will harvest Argan oil by hand, which is more ethical and environmentally friendly.Dr Chris Draper, head of animal welfare and captivity at the charity Born Free, said: Images of goats in trees have become iconic, suggesting a rural idyll where crafty and agile animals have learned to make the most of their environmentSadly, the reality seems to be that this is anything but natural, and is instead an exploitative set-up, designed to snare unsuspecting tourists to pay to take pictures.The animals are unable or unwilling to move from where they are placed in the trees by people.This means that they will be unable to move into shade or to forage in a normal manner.The situation is likely to be very stressful for the goats, made worse by being placed next to a busy road and with streams of visitors stopping to take a look.This is just one of several issues of which we are aware in Morocco where animals are being abused to cater for a demand and provide photo opportunities for tourists.Born Free urges everyone to keep an eye out for animals while travelling and on holiday: if something seems too good to be true, it probably is.Born Free will soon be launching our new initiative, Raise the Red Flag, to collate public reports of animals in need, and to provide people with the tools to make their voice heard for animals.Please review our commenting policyCans of \u0026#39air of an outgoing era\u0026#39 go on sale in Japan for £7.50 ahead of new emperorLyra Mckee\u0026#39s family pay

jong un heads russia first meeting putin","story":"Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un will discuss denuclearisation in Vlaostok on ThursdayNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un has left for the Russian city of Vlaostok for his first meeting with president Vladimir Putin, during which the two are expected to discuss sanctions, regional security and Pyongyang’s growing need for food aid. Kim left here by a private train at dawn on Wednesday to visit the Russian Federation, the North\u0027s official Korean Central News Agency reported, kicking off a 20-hour journey to the far north-east of his country, where it has a short border with Russia. An aide to Mr Putin said the two leaders would focus on the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but were not planning to make a joint declaration or sign any agreements.“This summit is a third pillar that is designed to demonstrate to the US that North Korea has options that allow it to ersify its diplomatic outreach as it tries to break the US sanctions stranglehold”, he said. “It’s a strong signal that it has lots of options and that it won’t be forced into a bad deal with the US,” he told The . North Korean and Russian flags fly from lampposts on Russky island where the leaders will meetTalks between Kim and US president Donald Trump in Hanoi in February broke down after the United States refused to completely lift sanctions in exchange for the dismantling of the Yongbyon nuclear weapons research facility.Mr Putin\u0027s aide said Russia was seeking to follow a 2017 road map for denuclearisation it drafted with China, which called for the end of US missile tests in the area.There are growing indications that North Korea is being affected by sanctions imposed by the United Nations as a result of its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and Mr Kim is likely to appeal to Mr Putin for assistance in having those sanctions lifted as well as exploring ways to get around them. Russia has already donated 50,000 tonnes of grain to the North as emergency food aid and Mr Kim is expected to ask for more, as well as assistance with energy supplies. The issue of North Korean “slave” labourers abroad, a key source of income for Pyongyang, could be raised after Russia said it had sent home two-thirds of some 30,000 such workers to comply with UN sanctions.Mr Nagy added that the North Korean dictator may also seek ways to obtain the luxuries that he bestows on the key people in his regime that he needs to keep happy in order to retain power. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un departs to visit Russia at undisclosed location Mr Putin - whose government is also under US sanctions - could be receptive to requests for aid. He has criticised Washington\u0027s pressure on Pyongyang, suggesting that US belligerence has forced it to continue developing weapons. Russia has been accused of helping North Korea dodge the UN embargo on fuel shipments. Attempts to increase his diplomatic influence in the region complement the trade deals and military exercises undertaken for what Mr Putin has called a “pivot to Asia”.Moscow has previously sought to revive the six-party talks that temporarily achieved the closure of North Korean nuclear facilities in 2007.“It’s clear that Mr Putin is trying to complicate the US diplomatic presence in the region and efforts to achieve the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and he wants Moscow to have a greater say in what happens in the region,” Mr Nagy said. North Korea is one of the few topics on which the United States continues to consult with Russia, most recently sending a special envoy to Moscow last week.For his part, Mr Kim is believed to be playing Russia off against its neighbouring superpower rival, China, as he seeks assistance and concessions that permit him to remain in power in the North.Russian media have reported that Mr Kim and Mr Putin will hold talks at the Far Eastern Federal University on Thursday before the Russian leader goes on to a conference in Beijing scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Mr Kim will remain in Vlaostok until Friday for a “cultural programme,” Russian media said.The summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in Hanoi in February failed to produce an agreementIt is his first visit to Russia, as he cancelled a 2015 trip to attend the Victory Day parade on Red Square.Reports in Japan have suggested that North Korean officials have visited a number of sites ahead of his arrival, indicating that he will visit the city’s Mariinsky Ballet theatre, the headquarters of the Russian Pacific Fleet and possibly the city’s aquarium. He will be following in the footsteps of his father Kim Jong-il, who inspected a Russian warship and purchased several dozen cakes at a bakery during his 2002 visit to meet Mr Putin. Preparations were in full swing on Tuesday as two unscheduled planes believed to be carrying Mr Kim\u0027s security detail landed at Vlaostok airport. The leader will reportedly have an entourage of 230 people. Mobile phone footage showed a motorcade with two limousines driving into the Far Eastern Federal University, which met Mr Kim\u0027s security demands thanks to its location on an island outside the city proper.Workers at the Vlaostok railway station reportedly even had to deepen an exit ramp by 20 centimetres so Mr Kim\u0027s limousine would be able drive out.Please review our commenting policyCans of \u0026#39air of an outgoing era\u0026#39 go on sale in Japan for £7.50 ahead of new emperorLyra Mckee\u0026#39s family pay tribute to \u0026#39gentle innocent soul\u0026#39 ahead of funeral for murdered journalist Hugging and kissing at work should be banned, employees say, as survey reveals social \u0026#34minefield\u0026#34 of greetingsHancock: NHS must adopt new technology or it will not survive Standing on long rail journeys to be banned under Virgin Trains plan for airline-style faresUp to a third of child sex abuse images online are self generated as more children live stream, says internet watchdog\u0026#39Marsquake\u0026#39 detected for first time, Nasa saysPrince Harry shows support for transgender children as controversial charity invited to mental health talksTheresa May defies security warnings of ministers and US to allow Huawei to help build Britain\u0026#39s 5G network Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate: \u0026#39I\u0026#39ve entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39Brothers paid to attack Jussie Smollett sue his lawyers for defamationWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/23/TELEMMGLPICT000011314375_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqMGnID9AZlSX2y3u-_6yA3NOybx1N6B3dmp0a3sda5d4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"marsquake detected first time nasa says","story":"An image of the Martian surface from Nasa\u0026#39s Curiosity RoverNasa has detected a probable Marsquake for the first time.The suspected seismic event on the Red Planet was recorded using silicon sensors developed in the UK.Nasa said the measuring of the quake, which occurred on April 6, marked the birth of a new discipline - Martian seismology.Chris Skidmore, the science minister, said it was a testament to the UK’s world leading science and engineering space sector.Professor Tom Pike of Imperial College London, leading the UK contribution, said: This is what we were all waiting for, the first quivering of the planet picked up by our sensors.

estate says does not approve nicholas hoult biopic","story":"Nicholas Hoult plays JRR Tolkien before he became a famous authorArts and Entertainment EditorThe family of JRR Tolkien has issued a rare public statement disavowing a new biopic about his life.Ahead of the film’s release, the Tolkien Estate said they had no part in its making and “do not endorse it or its content in any way”.Tolkien focuses on the author’s formative years, before he wrote The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. In the words of the publicity material, it traces “how the young Tolkien transformed from a lonely orphan into one of the great storytellers of all time”, and stars Nicholas Hoult.It explores Tolkien’s relationship with Edith Bratt, who went on to become his wife and the inspiration for some of his characters, and his “fellowship” with three schoolfriends who would enlist together in the First World War.Tolkien’s time on the Western Front is portrayed as the hellish inspiration for his fantasy writing, with explosions transformed in his mind into fire-breathing dragons.The makers of the film did not invite the Tolkien family to participate, and some artistic licence is in evidence. The statement issued yesterday read: “The family of JRR Tolkien and the Tolkien Estate are aware of the Fox Searchlight motion picture entitled Tolkien that is due for release in May 2019.“The family and the Estate wish to make clear that they did not approve of, authorise or participate in the making of this film.“They do not endorse it or its content in any way.”Nicholas Hoult and Lily Collins in a scene from TolkienSources said the family had turned down previous approaches to dramatise the author’s life, and were concerned that the title of this film might suggest it is in some way authorised.The literary executor of the Tolkien estate is his son, Christopher, who lives in France and is fiercely protective of his father’s name. He has given only one interview in 50 years, to the newspaper Le Monde, in which he said that the Tolkien legacy was the source of “intellectual despair”.“I could write a book on the idiotic requests I have received,” he said then.He loathed the Lord of the Rings blockbusters made by Peter Jackson, dismissing them as “an action movie for people aged 15 to 25”. Tolkien sold the film rights in 1969 for £100,000, as a way of raising money to help his children pay future inheritance tax.The author died in 1973. The film franchise became one of the highest-grossing of all time and the estate sued for a share of the profits, reaching a settlement in 2009.The real Edith Bratt, who was the inspiration for Tolkien\u0026#39s characters Lúthien Tinúviel and Arwen EvenstarThe new film, which opens on May 3, takes liberties with some facts. In one of the most dramatic moments, Tolkien discovers on the eve of his departure for the Somme that Edith is engaged to another man (the couple were reluctantly separated by his , a Catholic priest, who believed the relationship was keeping Tolkien from his academic studies).In reality, she accepted Tolkien\u0027s proposal in 1913 and they were married by the time he left for the Front.The film’s director, Dome Karukoski, has said Tolkien is not a standard biopic. Lily Collins, who plays Edith, said she was excited by the opportunity “to take what could have been just a period drama and flip it on its head, to make it something both more creative and more human”.John Garth, author of Tolkien and the Great War: The Threshold of Middle-earth, said he hoped audiences would enjoy the film as a work of fiction and that some would go on to explore further by reading a biography.He said: “Artistic licence is important, and movies understandably compress and streamline because there is only so much that can be shown in two hours. But the truth is generally more interesting.”Please review our commenting policyCans of \u0026#39air of an outgoing era\u0026#39 go on sale in Japan for £7.50 ahead of new emperorLyra Mckee\u0026#39s family pay tribute to \u0026#39gentle innocent soul\u0026#39 ahead of funeral for murdered journalist Hugging and kissing at work should be banned, employees say, as survey reveals social \u0026#34minefield\u0026#34 of greetingsStanding on long rail journeys to be banned under Virgin Trains plan for airline-style faresHancock: NHS must adopt new technology or it will not survive Up to a third of child sex abuse images online are self generated as more children live stream, says internet watchdogKim Jong-un heads to Russia for first meeting with Putin\u0026#39Marsquake\u0026#39 detected for first time, Nasa saysPrince Harry shows support for transgender children as controversial charity invited to mental health talksTheresa May defies security warnings of ministers and US to allow Huawei to help build Britain\u0026#39s 5G network Rachel Johnson unveiled as Change UK MEP candidate: \u0026#39I\u0026#39ve entered politics to spend more time with my family\u0026#39Comment: If the Tories want to survive, they only have one option: send for BorisTheresa May told by Cabinet ministers to dump talks with Labour and sort out her Brexit dealCathay Pacific flight attendants to be randomly inspected after taking home treats meant for passengersPerhaps I could have saved them, says father of two British teenagers killed in Sri Lanka bombingsPolice told to reclaim the streets for President Donald Trump\u0026#39s State visit A-level and GCSE exam papers are to be micro-chipped for first time in bid to combat online leaksIsil releases video of Sri Lanka suicide bombers swearing allegiance amid growing evidence of security blundersNeo-Nazi linked to group who said Prince Harry was a race traitor for marrying Meghan pleads guiltySisi to stay in power in Egypt until 2030 after referendum \u0026#39victory\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/04/04/09/avengers-endgame.jpg","title":"avengers endgame first reactions review marvel spoilers trailer twitter captain america","story":"IM Subscribe \u0026nbsp registerIM SubscribeCreated with Sketch.IM Join us?

In the US, the film is\u0026nbspexpected to earn between $250m and $268m in the first three days of release.The biggest domestic debut of all time is last year’s Infinity War, the precursor to Endgame, which earned $257.7m during that period, making it fairly likely\u0026nbspthat Endgame will take the top spot. Star Wars: The Force Awakens currently sits in second place with $248m and The Last Jedi sits in third with $220m. Only six films have earned more than $200m in their opening weekends.\u0026nbspInfinity War also currently boasts the best global launch with $640m, although it didn’t beat the international record as the film opened in China two weeks after most other territories.\u0026nbspFate of the Furious currently holds the record for the best international opening weekend with $443m.\u0026nbspEndgame, however, will open globally at the same time, with current predictions suggesting it could earn more than $800m in total on opening weekend, which would also put it in a good position to beat Fate of the Furious for the international record.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

When Danielle Atkins joined the company as vice president\u0026nbspand global chief brand officer\u0026nbspin 2014, the business was just emerging from bankruptcy, struggling to keep up with new trends and no longer resonating with younger audiences.Four years later,\u0026nbspKodak is not completely out of the woods.\u0026nbspBut it’s already doing better, with a growing brand licensing business worth $3m\u0026nbsp(£2.3m) and a consumer ision which brought $48m (£36.5m) in revenue during the third quarter of last year. Atkins was arguably one of the biggest players behind the brand’s revival. Throughout her career, she was never one to shy away from a challenge.“When I left my position as a marketing director at Beats\u0026nbspBy Dre, my 17-year-old son asked\u0026nbspme, ‘Why would you leave Beats for Kodak? What is Kodak?’” she tells The Independent.A View from the Top with Greg Jackson, CEO of green energy Octopus“But for me, working for that brand, which in my mind was one of the greatest in the world, was a big exciting opportunity. Kodak had forgotten that they had a brand that people genuinely cared about.”Her passion for the\u0026nbspcompany started during her childhood in Penzance. John Adams, her father, was one of the pioneers of the west Cornwall surf scene in the 1960s and made Super 8mm films featuring local surfers, while her mother Sally was a stills photographer.“When my brother and I were young we used to travel around with my parents, while my father was showing his movies,” Atkins\u0026nbspsays.\u0026nbsp“At that time you couldn’t see surf movies in the cinema and there was no video or YouTube.\u0026nbsp“We had this incredibly bohemian lifestyle, where we were basically brought up on a beach. It was all about surfing, music and film.”After graduating with a degree in history of art and medieval archaeology from UCL, she got a job at Pres.co, one of the first digital agencies working on some of the earliest websites in the late 1990s.“We won Marks \u0026amp Spencer as a client, and I remember being in front of their board aged 21, presenting our first digital campaign – it was a really disruptive time. The big advertisement agencies were still very dominant so what we were doing was very innovative.”Moving quickly up the career ladder, Atkins\u0026nbspheld senior marketing positions at PwC, Nokia and Innovision, where she was responsible for dressing the city for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, including the notorious installation of the Olympic Rings on the Tower Bridge that she still refers to as one of the biggest highlights of her career.Looking for her next challenge, she quit her job as director of creative expression at Nokia in 2013\u0026nbspfor what was then a small start-up called Beats By Dre.“It was a huge job but that’s the point about going to startups,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“Beats only had about 70 to 80 people employees at the time and the volume of work we did was incredible.”Her energy and her collaborative approach saw massive growth in both the company’s sales and revenue. Notably, she led the team who made Beats the\u0026nbsp“most talked about brand” during the 2014 Brazil World Cup with\u0026nbsp“The Game Before The Game” campaign.Featuring footballers including Cesc Fabregas, Luis Suarez, Daniel Sturridge ​and Brazil’s\u0026nbspNeymar alongside non-sporting celebrities, the star-studded advert accumulated nearly 34 million views on YouTube.“It was a five-minute\u0026nbspvideo that we launched like a film and activated in every single city around the world,” Atkins says.\u0026nbsp“I was just 34-years-old at the time and working with a very young team. For us, it felt a huge job and it was thrilling every day.”But things changed quickly when Beats was acquired by Apple in 2014.“I enjoy working in a very fast-paced environment, which enables me to be entrepreneurial. This was very easy to do at Beats but much harder to do in a company like Apple.

By 2010, it is the seventh biggest2011: Kodak shares fall by more than 80 per cent, partly because the company struggles to meet pension costs for its2012 - Kodak files for chapter 11 bankruptcySix months after the acquisition, she was approached by Kodak and took a leap of faith leaving a thriving company for one barely emerging from bankruptcy. “What’s been amazing for me with this role is that I was able to make Kodak what I wanted,” she says.\u0026nbsp“I always wanted to do a job I was passionate about and being part of the turnaround team at Kodak meant I could really allow myself to be creative.”So how did she change the brand’s fortunes?With very limited budgets, Atkins set about identifying who the brand’s customers were and\u0026nbspcame to understand that its heart and core audience came from the creative fields.“When budgets are small, you have to be very creative for a start. You need to look at what you have and what you can work with.\u0026nbspWhat I had was a brand with an amazing history, heritage and a legacy of incredible branding and graphic design.”Part of the inspiration behind the redesign of the company was looking back at the heritage of the brand and weaving\u0026nbspthe vision of Kodak’s founder, George Eastman back into it.For this reason, the first thing Atkins did was to bring back a similar iteration of the Kodak K logo\u0026nbspintroduced in 1971. “I started spotting old Kodak logos everywhere around the world, so I wanted to revive and bring back the colour into the logo,” she explains.More than a hundred years earlier, Eastman had invented roll film, allowing photography to become a hobby of the masses.\u0026nbsp“You don’t buy a Kodak Carousel slide viewer, you buy yesterday” –\u0026nbspas Don Draper told Kodak’s executives at the end of Mad Men’s first season, in one of the TV show’s most poignant moments.\u0026nbsp“It’s a time machine.”Atkins says: “With an amazing heritage brand like Kodak, leveraging that nostalgic element is important, but if you want to build a future business you can’t just rest on solely on heritage.”But if Kodak was going to stage a comeback in consumers’ hearts, it needed today’s teenagers and influencers behind it. This was no small task.When Atkins joined, Kodak didn’t even have an Instagram account – “just another example of how the brand had lost its way”.\u0026nbspMy father always said you should nail your colour to the mast. If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to tryFast-forward four years, and it now has a healthy\u0026nbsp400,000 followers, which Atkins describes as a community of creatives who\u0026nbspcare about the brand.In fact, the company is resurrecting one of Kodak’s most popular films, Ektachrome – a colour reversal, or transparency, film launched in 1946 and discontinued in 2013.Using her experience at Beats, Atkins also spearheaded a series of fashion collaborations with brands including\u0026nbspOpening Ceremony and\u0026nbspForever 21.The clothes for the latter were emblazoned with Kodak logos from the 1990s, harking back to when Kodak was the most recognisable photography brand.“One thing I learned at Beats, is that there’s never a better promotion than someone recognisable wearing your brand,” Atkins says.The\u0026nbspvogue for all things analogue has also paved for the company to launch Kodachrome, an art magazine coined as a “new journal for anyone who loves art, film, and analogue culture”. The latest cover story was on Spike Lee, just after the release of BlacKkKlansman, which was shot on film.Youngsters’\u0026nbsplove affair with modern nostalgia is also helping to fuel demand for instant print, one of Kodak’s biggest sectors.Atkins says: “Large numbers of still photographers and creative are turning their backs on digital technology in favour of film. There’s something romantic about the process.”The reward was perhaps changing her son Zachary’s mind about Kodak.“He now thinks what we’re doing is very cool and for me that is a sign we’re doing things right.”Atkins certainly has energy. This year, she is training for a running race that\u0026nbspwill take her from Los Angeles to Las Vegas – 340 miles across the hostile terrain of the Nevada desert. With her brother last year she finished a bike ride from Cornwall to Mont Saint Michel in France.A view from the top with Regina Borda, Pizza Hut managing directorA View from the Top with Mark CuddiganA View from the Top with Jo Malone, the ‘Queen of fragrance’Nadhim Zahawi: the CEO turned children’s minister Kodak shares double after launching its own cryptocurrency“My father always said you should nail your colour to the mast,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“If someone tells me I can’t do something I automatically want to try.”Atkins, also mother to Eli, 11, firmly believes that women shouldn’t choose between having a career and having a family.“I was scared about having children, the whole idea of being pregnant scared me,” she says.\u0026nbsp“But I now consider them my two biggest achievements in life. It never stopped me from doing what I wanted.“You just have to be organised and also set a good example to people in your team, especially if you’re in a leading position.“I have to force myself to take an hour a day that is just for me – and it’s usually sports related or just walking my dog.\u0026nbsp You need that time, otherwise your head is always crowded with things.”Atkins is now working on\u0026nbspa business plan with an entrepreneur for Kodak’s latest project in the beauty sector – another first for the brand.“There’s a connection between looking good on camera and the beauty industry,” she explains.\u0026nbsp“It’s one of the most exciting projects that we’ve got and it’s directly associated with Hollywood, film and glamour.\u0026nbsp“Even if we’ve never done it before, it seems to be like there’s a natural connection. It’s all about always having a genuine commitment to innovation and creativity.”A View from the TopOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Still, it was pretty cynical of the retailer to leave it until 3pm on the day before the extended Easter weekend to confirm\u0026nbspthe widely trailed departure.\u0026nbsp“Now that our new financing facilities are in place, it is time to move on, knowing the company is in good hands with a plan that will deliver a sustainable future,” said the former Amazoner who must wish he’d never left the internet giant.\u0026nbspDebenhams is on the brink, but could a retail genius save it?Debenhams falls into administrationMike Ashley calls for Debenhams bosses to take lie detector testsSure, being the ultimate boss holds a powerful pull even for executives with fancy jobs at prestigious companies. But Debenhams was on a sticky wicket when he joined and the warning signs should have been obvious enough to him.\u0026nbspTurning the business around was always going to be a tough ask, one made all the more difficult by the requirement to fend off Sports Direct kingpin Mike Ashley, who ultimately got Bucher booted off the board for his trouble.\u0026nbspBut we’re always being told people like him are rare talents with the ability to fly, run around the world at\u0026nbspsix million miles an hour, shoot lasers from their eyes\u0026nbspand turn retailing sows ears and into silk purses while they’re at it. That’s why they need such fancy salary and bonus packages.\u0026nbspBucher singularly failed to live up to the hype in almost every respect bar one: keeping Ashley at bay.\u0026nbspThere are still\u0026nbspplenty who will thank him for that but\u0026nbspit\u0027s probably not enough to save his retailing rep, at least in this country.\u0026nbspDebehams said that a search is now underway for his successor, to which the obvious reaction is to say, “good luck with that”.\u0026nbspHaving been through an administration process, the retailer is now owned by its lenders. In the short term\u0026nbspit still needs restructuring. That inevitably means store closures and job losses. In the longer term, they’ll want to sell it to someone.

to adapt to rising competition from online competitors and a general decline of high street shopping.It has also been saddled with high costs from its large number of stores.Only the best news in your

The parasitic disease kills about 435,000 people every year – the majority of them children under the age of five in Africa.Pedro Alonso, director of WHO’s malaria program, said similar vaccination programmes would begin in the coming weeks in Kenya and Ghana, with the aim of reaching about 360,000 children across the three countries.Mr Alonso called the vaccination rollout a “historic\u0026nbspmoment”. Despite acknowledging the vaccine was flawed, he said the world could not afford to wait for a better option. “We don’t know how long it will take to develop the next-generation vaccine. It may be many, many years away.”Created with Sketch.Can malaria be beaten? Show all 2Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The vaccine, known as Mosquirix, was developed by GlaxoSmithKline and was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2015.A previous trial showed the vaccine was about 30 per cent effective in children who got four doses, but that protection waned over time. Reported side effects include pain, fever and convulsions.It took GSK and partners more than 30 years to develop the vaccine, at a cost of around $1bn\u0026nbsp(£770m). GSK is donating up to 10 million vaccine doses in the current vaccination initiatives. A company spokesman said GSK is working with partners to secure funding for potentially broader vaccination programmes.AFPGetty Images)Mr Alonso said the stalled progress against malaria demanded tools to combat now, noting that it was significantly more difficult to design a vaccine against a parasite as opposed to a bacterium or virus.Resistance is growing to medicines that treat the disease, while mosquitoes are becoming more resistant to insecticides. In addition, funding for malaria efforts has plateaued in recent years.Watch David Beckham ‘speak in nine languages\u0027 about malariaDrug that makes human blood \u0027lethal\u0027 to mosquitoes can combat malaria“It’s an imperfect vaccine but it still has the potential to save tens of thousands of lives,” said Alister Craig, dean of biological sciences at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, who is not linked to WHO or vaccine.Mr Craig said immunising the most vulnerable children during peak malaria seasons could spare many thousands from falling ill or even dying.Some experts have warned the vaccination programmes should not ert limited public health funds from inexpensive and proven tools to curb malaria such as bed nets and insecticides.“This is a bold thing to do, but it’s not a silver bullet,” said Thomas Churcher, a malaria expert at Imperial College London. “As long as using the vaccine doesn’t interfere with other efforts, like the urgent need for new insecticides, it is a good thing to do.”Mr Craig said one of health officials’ biggest challenges could be convincing parents to bring their children for repeated doses of a vaccine that only protects about a third of children for a limited amount of time.More commonly used vaccines, like those for polio and measles, work more than 90 per cent of the time. “This malaria vaccine is going to save many lives, even if it is not as good as we would like,” Mr Craig said. “But I hope this will kick-start other research efforts so that the story doesn’t end here.”Additional reporting by APOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But writers have been talking about this stuff for centuries.King Lear’s shuffle into dementia as he tears apart his kingdom on a vain whim. Dickens’s revolutionary bloodshed in A Tale of Two Cities conjuring tensions within and across borders. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman challenging the imperialist march of the Nazis in Casablanca. How does culture sort out the bloody mess of social, political\u0026nbspand geographical isions? Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature.Ali Smith’s Autumn – the first in her seasonal quartet (the third in the cycle, Spring, has just come out) – is perhaps the first “Brexit novel” (what a terrifying label!), written in the immediate wake of the 2016 referendum. Its opening lines wave to Dickens: “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.” Too right, Ali. “That’s the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will.” Here a nod to Yeats’s A Second Coming. Yeats, Smith, Dickens, Shakespeare: they’re all rife with images of separation, objects torn asunder. Yeats writes:Things fall apart the centre cannot holdAll too apt for today. In last year’s National Theatre production, Ian McKellen’s King Lear actually tears up the map of his kingdom in a haphazard, manically whimsical way. Dickens’s evocation of “Madame La Guillotine”, sensuously and seductively worshipped by the revolutionaries in A Tale of Two Cities, replacing crucifixes and covering the streets with blood, is an object that literally and metaphorically separates. And this is a thread taken up by Smith in the literary descriptions of collage art scattered across Autumn: beautiful and haphazard like fallen leaves, but also artistically juxtaposing separation and difference.Created with Sketch.The 25 best books by women Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work.

Politics. Class. Nationality. Age. A Brexit checklist.There is a widely held perception that it was the baby boomers who swung the 2016 referendum in favour of Leave, the older generation who have a lot less to lose. This generational ide reverberates through cultural depictions of ided nations too.Brexit: The Uncivil War review – an engrossing second draft of historyShakespeare’s King Lear is a play about madness and politics, shown through the failings of a father. Lear decides to bequeath his three daughters different portions of his kingdom according to how much they love him or rather, how convincingly they can express their love for him. Literature is all about conflict. So perhaps it’s unsurprising that not all of Lear’s daughters go along with this display of pride and vanity.The first two, Goneril and Regan, egged on by their greedy husbands, eagerly flatter their father. But when it comes to the third, Cordelia – the youngest and the favourite – the voice of reason prevails. She tells her father that she loves him just as much as a dutiful daughter should but that there’s no need to flatter his delusion of a good Brexit deal. Ahem. The need for a healthy sized dowry with which she can attract a good husband.King Lear is so convinced of his worth and his children’s performance of love for him, that he makes the biggest booboo possible just as he’s on the decline: he chops up his kingdom and pisses off his loved ones. The UK is so convinced of Europe’s desperation to be friends, we’ve made the booboo of expecting an Ali Baba Cave of Wonders with the Brexit deal. And it’s about as realistic an expectation as Ali Baba’s treasure.A Tale of Two Cities\u0026nbspis in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across bordersA Tale of Two Cities is also, in effect, about politics and madness, and how the shadows of the older generation linger over the young. It’s set during the reign of terror, late\u0026nbsp18th century Paris and London, the French Revolution. And this period is conjured through the twisted fate of a father, daughter, and two men who bear a striking physical resemblance to one another but are diametrically opposed in character. Like Shakespeare, Dickens also shows the father being cause of his beloved daughter’s despair, but, in his case, it is unwitting. It is the father’s accidental testimony that ultimately leads to the death sentence for his son-in-law, Charles Darnay.Ali Smith’s Autumn is a quiet elegy to a Europe in demise, and the condemned, precarious young who have to watch it falter. It effectively picks up the ShakespeareanDickensian tale from the perspective of the daughter. The protagonist, Elisabeth Demand: 32 years old, no-fixed-hours casual contract junior lecturer at a university in London, living the dream, her mother says, and she is, if the dream means having no job security and almost everything being too expensive to do and that you’re still in the same rented flat you had when you were a student over a decade ago.Stryver at Tellson’s Bank, from a scene in ‘A Tale of Two Cities’\u0026nbsp(Getty)In many ways, she epitomises a generation, or at least part of it.\u0026nbspElisabeth loves and desperately clings to her dying friend, the 101-year-old former émigré, Daniel Gluck – the personification of a disappearing Europe, a cultured, sensitive, intelligent man, full of possibility and mystery. By contrast, Elisabeth has a strained relationship with her mother – a woman more interested in going to the pub than getting to know her neighbours.These stories show the fuck-ups of the older generation condemning the young to a life of lost possibility – the lost possibility to travel, to live, to love as we want.But it was also overwhelmingly the case that non-graduates were far more likely to vote to leave the EU than those with degrees. And this brings up the question of class and privilege.At the heart of A Tale of Two Cities is a raging class war, a class war of caricatured evil. The Marquis St\u0026nbspEvrémonde, the aristocrat who needs no fewer than four servants to prepare his morning hot chocolate while people starve in the streets, speeds through Paris in his voluptuous carriage and hits a small child, killing him instantly. He insults the crowd, calls them dogs, curses them for delaying him and not taking better care of their children. Then he goes on his way, barely ruffled. In this climate, the bloodthirsty rising of the proletariat seems to have a pretty strong justification.A Tale of Two Cities is in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across borders. One of the factors that damns the hero, Charles Darnay, is his decision to live in exile in England. He explains this as an economic immigration: in France, he has no means to live.A Tale of Two Cities and its modernised re-telling in Casablanca both resolve the turgid concoction of political and romantic tensions (semi-spoiler alert) through acts of self-sacrifice. One person trades places with another. We see this kind of doubling in King Lear too with the half-brothers Edmund and Edgar, alike in name but polar opposites in character. And, much like Harry Potter and Voldemort (a DickensianShakespearean echo?), it seems that in each of these pairs, one must die so that the other may live.King Lear\u0026nbspshows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?)This isn’t really a satisfactory solution to today’s problems. There isn’t the possibility of some kind of self-sacrifice that will ensure continued life in another sense. Maybe a soft Brexit looks like that: a Brexit in name but with all the benefits of the customs union and free movement. But it now seems inevitable that the country is going to be fundamentally ided no matter what the political developments may yield.But it’s worth remembering that all of these works are also basically love stories – though not necessarily about conventional, romantic love.King Lear shows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?).\u0026nbspA Tale of Two Cities shows an impossible love triangle between upstanding French émigrés and disaffected, drunken Brits that cannot end happily. There aren’t enough visas for all the protagonists to escape France, so who will make it out?Casablanca is a classic romance that transcends geographical borders. As Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) looks into Rick’s (Humphrey Bogart’s) eyes and tells him she can never leave him again, but she does need the two blank visas that will enable escape from Casablanca and the Nazis, the tears feel real, the kiss feels passionate, the violins soar. Later, Rick sees this moment in a different light. He suggests it was a way of manipulating him into aiding the escape.Bros)And so, we go back to King Lear. His elder daughters make eloquent expressions of their love for him, but it’s clear to everyone other than Lear himself that these are opportunistic overtures with one thing in mind: hope for geographical reign and economic power.The problem for the UK is that the EU isn’t as senile and blinded by vanity as Lear, nor as romantically sentimental as Bogart’s Rick or Dickens’s Sydney Carton. Expressions of love won’t get us through passport control any faster in the post-Brexit world.So what does Ali Smith’s Autumn suggest? Unlike Edgar and Edmund in King Lear, Charles and Sydney in A Tale of Two Cities, Rick and Laszlo in Casablanca, there is no straightforward doubling in Smith’s Autumn. But perhaps that’s part of the point. Elisabeth and Daniel are opposites in many respects. And yet they are drawn together in a touching, benevolent, platonic bond.The 25 best books written by womenThere’s a problem with the way we idolise drunk male writersThe most powerful lines of poetry ever writtenConservatives and Labour reveal plans for key Brexit votes- liveCummings found in contempt of parliament over ‘fake news’ inquiryIn Autumn, the man in the post office, a frustratingly unhelpful clerk positively filibustering Elisabeth’s attempts to do the “Check \u0026amp Send” service to renew her passport (all a huge great metonym for anxieties about identity, nationality, freedom to travel, etc), sees Elisabeth as many of this generation are seen: demanding like her name.“Is your surname really Demand? he says.Uh huh, Elisabeth says. I mean yes.A name you live up to, he says.”The contrasting way of seeing things is a point worth pondering in the light of Brexit and the fog of politics. In Casablanca, Laszlo and Rick are both in love with Ilse. But they see her in very different ways. When she tries to explain herself, her past, her motives to each of them in turn, she is confronted with totally contrasting responses. Laszlo: “You don’t even have to say it. I’ll believe.”\u0026nbspCompare with Rick: “I wouldn’t believe you, no matter what you told me. You’d say anything now to get what you want.”Isn’t this really how most of us feel about politicians? They represent these dualisms. And nothing epitomises this quite like the Brexit debate. People choose their side then believe all or nothing, depending on who’s talking. £350m\u0026nbspfor the NHS. Whether or not it was true seemed to depend more on the listener than the facts.In reality, there is no possibility for self-sacrifice or a deus ex machina to sort out the cataclysmic mess of parliament, Brexit\u0026nbspand national ision. The older stories, Shakespeare and Dickens, are tragedies. Someone has to die. Casablanca is more open, though still pretty heart-wrenching. Remember the famous closing line: “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”. And maybe Ali Smith picks up where Casablanca leaves off. A beautiful friendship. But the ending is left open. This is where we are now. Watching our relationship with Europe die.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.In an interview with India’s CNN News-18, Feige\u0026nbspfurther teased the project, adding: “I think every movie that we do is a risk. We only want to do movies that people seem to think are risks. Doing the story of an Asian-American hero of Chinese heritage is something that is very intriguing to us. It will be really different and special.”“I hope audiences around the world respond to it in the same way they did to Steve Rogers.. whether they have American flag or not.\u0026nbspIt’s about the inidual storyline, spectacle and adventure that come with Marvel Studios movies.”Avengers: Endgame is out in UK cinemas on 25 April.\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s the job of Remain politicians to defend them against the hate speech and acts that have\u0026nbspbeen on the rise since the EU referendum – not to join in.”She added that the episode “demonstrates the risks of assembling a list of celebrity candidates without having time to know their values”.The Independent Group registers as political party for EU electionsChange.org hits out at Independent Group MPs over new nameMcDonnell calls the Independent Group ‘completely irrelevant’“It underlines the extent to which Change UK is an empty prospectus: without a platform and with no idea which group they will sit with in the European parliament, how can they ask voters to choose their candidates?” she said.Mr Sadjady cancelled his membership of the Conservative party in March, citing the party’s handling of Brexit and Islamophobia allegations against it.He was unveiled as a candidate for Change UK to represent London on Tuesday in the upcoming European parliament elections.Other candidates for the party include former BBC journalist Gavin Esler, the former conservative deputy prime minister of Poland Jacek Rostowski, and Rachel Johnson, a journalist who is also the sister of Boris Johnson.At its election campaign launch the party said it would unveil some policies in the future, but immediately confirmed it would not be supporting a no-confidence vote in Theresa May’s government – potentially throwing the embattled prime minister a lifeline.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have kept my promise.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspnarrowly defeated the strongly favoured Mr Yildirim\u0026nbspof the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) in 31 March municipal elections that represented an unexpected setback for Mr Erdogan, who built his career as mayor of Istanbul 25 years ago. The city has served as the political backbone of the AKP, generating huge real estate deals that benefit the country\u0027s powerful development conglomerates and various oligarchs who support the party.“It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage, said Emre Erdogan, a political scientist at Istanbul\u0027s Bilgi University. They don’t want to transfer ownership\u0026nbspof the municipality. It means they will fight for it.Ekrem Imamoglu arrives at the Istanbul Election Board on Wednesday (EPA)The AKP\u0026nbspand its far-right ally, the National Movement Party (MHP), have\u0026nbspchallenged the elections,\u0026nbsppointing to unspecified irregularities. First\u0026nbspthey demanded\u0026nbspa recount, and now they are pushing for holding the entire Istanbul elections anew.Mr Imamoglu\u0026nbspholds\u0026nbspa 13,000-vote lead. There were few if any complaints or reports of election-day irregularities, and the AKP has yet to present any evidence to back up its claims of fraud. Mr Erdogan’s own interior minister Suleyman Soylu on Wednesday rejected the AKP’s fraud claims. “The election system in Turkey is better than anywhere else in the world,” local media quoted him as saying. “The system has no flaws. Such a discussion is baseless.Legal experts say the Supreme Election Commission – which is said to be packed with appointees by Mr​ Erdogan – could still vacate Mr Imamoglu’s mandate, and call for another election, and many analysts said they could not fathom the AKP not fighting for Istanbul until the end.It seems that the desire for Istanbul is very big in the government, because of all the patronage. They don’t want to transfer ownership of the municipality.The Supreme Election Council has already ordered a redo of the municipal contest in Honaz, a town of 30,000 that the AKP lost by a single vote.But that would carry risks for the government and the ruling party. Increasingly impatient supporters of Mr Imamoglu have been chanting in support of his mayoralty at football games, and a rerun of the election could draw even more opposition voters frustrated by a flailing economy and eroding political freedoms under the AKP.\u0026nbspStill some people can\u0027t countenance the idea of the AKP giving up on Istanbul, even if it means further undermining Turkey\u0027s fragile democratic institutions.\u0026nbspFor the AKP, the cost of losing Istanbul is greater than\u0026nbspthe image of\u0026nbspTurkey as a liberal democracy, said Mr Erdogan, the scholar.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Thursday will be the day, it was announced, Vladimir Putin will come face to face with Kim Jong-un in Vlaostok.\u0026nbspFrantic preparations already underway in Russia’s far-eastern capital had, of course, offered plenty of clues: the delivery of a blacked-out limousine, the arrival of two plane loads of security detail, an airport altercation between said detail and journalists, a resultant broken TV camera, and last-minute modifications to roads, ramps and station entrances to accommodate the North Korean convoy.\u0026nbspAs expected, Vlaostok’s Far Eastern Federal University looks to be the venue for the talks. Located on an island, its isolation is said to have impressed North Korean security chiefs. The university campus,\u0026nbspbuilt\u0026nbspto host the 2012 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit, also boasts enough luxury\u0026nbsphotel space\u0026nbspto accommodate the 230-strong delegation. By Tuesday morning, North Korean flags had appeared around the university.\u0026nbspSources in Moscow and Pyongyang suggested Mr Jong-un will travel the 425 miles from Pyongyang to Vlaostok aboard his famous armoured train, arriving in Russia sometime on Wednesday. Talks are due the following day, with the Russian leader leaving for dialogue with the Chinese leadership in the evening.\u0026nbspMr Jong-un, on the other hand, will be staying behind for a special “touristic programme”. Among the attractions being considered are a chocolate factory, the\u0026nbspRussian Pacific Navy\u0026nbspMilitary History Museum, and a newly opened branch of St Petersburg’s Mariinsky Theatre.\u0026nbspFor Moscow, the summit represents the culmination of many months of diplomacy.\u0026nbspIt was a year ago that Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov first travelled to Pyongyang to pass on Vladimir Putin’s invitation. Major overtures from other senior officials followed. But North Korea hesitated, preferring instead to concentrate on relations with China, South Korea and the United States.\u0026nbspThursday’s summit is the first-ever meeting\u0026nbspbetween the two leaders. But in the eight years since he came to power, Mr Jong-un\u0026nbsphas met with the Chinese leader Xi three times, and twice with Donald Trump –\u0026nbspin Singapore and Hanoi. The breakdown of the US talks appear\u0026nbspto be the main reason Mr Jong-un\u0026nbsphas decided to pivot towards Moscow.\u0026nbsp“Kim achieved nothing in Hanoi, so is now exploring other angles,” said\u0026nbspFyodor Tertitskiy, a North Korean analyst based in Seoul. “Mr Putin is desperate to be considered a person of significance on the Korean peninsula, and to use that\u0026nbspin diplomatic games with Washington.”\u0026nbspRussia, in Soviet times the key player in the region, is now largely deferential to the Chinese on Korean relations. But that does\u0026nbspnot mean they are unwilling\u0026nbspto re-engage, said\u0026nbspthe analyst.Ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesperson\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov said Russia would focus on matters of trade and nuclear disarmament. The Korean side, in return, is likely to press the Russians on how they can relieve the crushing international sanctions regime. But there are significant doubts that the summit will produce any meaningful declaration or agreements.More likely, this summit will instead be used to issue a declaration of intent, with the main recipient of the message being the United States. “It is essentially a sideshow in the continuing saga between Pyongyang and Washington,” said Dmitry Trenin, longtime head of the Moscow Carnegie Centre,\u0026nbspon Twitter. “Russia will seek to score diplomatic points by demonstrating its relevance North Korea\u0026nbspby showing it has options.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We as socialists want to show policies against this mindset are possible.”He’s travelling to the UK in a couple months to meet with constituents abroad, hoping to spread the word about how progressive politics can appeal to the masses in rural Turkey, and beyond.\u0026nbspBut before he can can do any of that, he has to hear out Tuna Seda, a 30-year-old local schoolteacher who pins him down in his office.

The government-appointed mayor, a loyalist to President Recep Tayyip\u0026nbspErdogan had built a concrete wall around city hall for security and oversaw a clampdown on political freedoms.“This is a place where people are under so much political pressure,” says Canan Ay Dogan, a deputy mayor. “When the trustees came in 2016, the security measures were tightened across the city. And they made people feel so uncomfortable. This created tension in public spaces.”​Macoglu\u0026nbsp(centre) meets constituents on the streets of Tunceli\u0026nbsp(Borzou DaragahiThe Independent)Macoglu won the mayoralty with about 33 per cent of the vote, besting the 28 per cent the candidate of the leftist, Kurdish-led HDP and the 20 per cent of centre-left People’s Republican Party. The candidate of Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party won only 14 per cent of the vote.Just days after receiving his official mandate as mayor, Macoglu had the walls around city hall torn down, and the X-ray machine removed, saying he wanted to get rid of “obstacles” between the government and the people. He is also is planning to sell off the city’s official cars, and drives himself back and forth to work.On a recent visit to Tunceli, dozens of well-wishers and citizens with local concerns – like Seda – drifted in and out of the building and of Macoglu’s offices, which were filled with congratulatory bouquets from businesses and luminaries.Macoglu had already won a measure of national acclaim as district mayor of a neighbourhood in Tunceli called Ovacik. When first elected in 2014, he vowed in an interview with the newspaper Cumhuriyet to visit Cuba, China and Venezuela “to analyse the success of communist administrations” and “prove in Turkey that communism is not the bogeyman”.His ideas and policies veered towards the pragmatic.How 1989 became the year that communism collapsedHe posted the neighbourhood’s balance sheet on a banner outside the municipality building. He set up free public transportation corridors to shuttle passengers from home to work and a cooperative to produce and sell local produce.He provided a measure of financial support to teachers fired from their jobs by Erdogan in a crackdown that followed a 2016 coup attempt, helping them to set up dairy and beekeeping businesses.Most successfully, he established a scheme to plant chickpeas, potatoes and beans on state-owned land and then use the proceeds to fund scholarships for poor youth.He now wants to expand his programmes to the entire city, by for example, establishing free public transport along certain downtown routes.“We want to improve the quality of life for everyone, but we must support poor people,” he says. “Basic needs should be met for free. That’s my basic idea.”One programme he hopes to launch is to give villagers seeds and let them\u0026nbspplant on public land repurposed as collective farming areas. “We want to create farming areas so that people can grow their own produce,” he says.He said he’s also keen on drawing more tourists, and hopes to create a number of cultural events, better market the natural beauty of Tunceli, and lure visitors curious about the region’s left-leaning politics.Tunceli, in Turkey’s eastern Anatolia region (GettyiStock)An area populated by Kurds and members of Turkey’s Alevi religious minority, Tunceli has a unique tradition of leftist politics that likely can’t be replicated across most of Turkey.Some have likened him to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York City socialist who has become a national sensation in the US.“He’s a product of Tunceli,” says Asli Aydintasbas, a Turkish journalist and political analyst. “Tunceli is a very specific place. It’s counter-establishment. Someone like that could be elected in Tunceli the way someone like AOC could only be elected in the Bronx and Queens.”Like the self-described democratic socialist, Macoglu likes to keep his ears to the ground. All of his best ideas, he says, came from hearing out the needs of constituents.“I listen to people,” he says. “I listen to them and figure out what they want, and then look at the tools that I have.”Over the years as a municipal leader, he’s learned to adjust his aspirations. Addressing the noise complaints of a constituent may not change the world, but it’s doable. “When you’re trying to do big things, it’s not always possible,” he says. “What we’re trying to do is to make the small dreams of people come true.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

None of them are free.Leaders from across our faith communities are standing together to speak out against slavery.Last year the Church of England and the Catholic Church launched the Safe Car Wash App to help drivers report slavery at car washes — one industry alone that’s thought to have thousands of enslaved workers.After just six months, users have reported over , suspected cases, helping the police to tackle this plague.In my own Diocese I know there is crucially important work going on to support these victims.At All Souls Church in Langham Place, at the heart of the West End, the charity Tamar provides essential support and advocacy by reaching out to women who are suffering through sexual exploitation.Tamar takes inspiration from the two stories of women in the Bible being badly mistreated by men and society,The appeal has built on the work of the Clewer Initiative, which has called for a community -wide response to modern slavery — developing partnerships between the Church, statutory and non-statutory agencies, to create a network of advocates seeking to end modern day slavery.As we celebrate the new le of Jesus Christ, let us remember that new le comes not just after death but for those that are living.The UK recognised a staggering , victims from  countries in , including adults who had been used for organ harvesting and children that were forced into sexual exploitation.At present, trafficked victims have just  days support after being freed before they are expected to leave the UK and are deported by the Home Office.During this short time, they are given accommodation, financial aid, medical treatment, counselling, a support worker, a translator and legal advice.We want the government to: Back Lord McColls proposed bill, which suggests all victims of modern slavery should be given a years support to recover.Alongside that they should be given special support to help them, including housing benefits, financial help and other services.This week’s devastation of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, and the remarkable demonstrations of solidarity and generosity that have emerged in its aftermath, are testament to the power of community and show the spirit of resurrection in action.If we could apply that same spirit to the terrible injustice of slavery in our communities, through working together, looking closely for what is hidden in plain sight, and supporting the excellent work of charities, we can give new le to those thousands of victims of modern slavery.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough. Before then, the Tories face twin wipeouts in the local and European elections. The latter may be utterly pointless but nevertheless, a derisory performance is still going to be deeply traumatic when it happens.Theresa May’s ministers have dutully supported her in the past.Her duty is now to step aside immediately, before she accidentally ends up leading her party to an even greater humiliation in a general election than the one it suffered in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A quarter of Brits are sufferers at the moment.Its becoming increasingly typical to develop hay fever later in le, Professor Adam Fox, a consultant allergist who was the clinical lead of Allergy at Guy’s  St Thomas’ Hospital told the .He told the paper that hay fever has been becoming steadily worse every year for the past few years and although experts dont know exactly why middle-aged people are developing it, its thought that pollution is largely to blame.The National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit at Worcester University has said that increased traffic and poor air quality are causing pollen to become trapped at ground level - keeping it within easy breathing distance of hay fever sufferers.Being overly clean is also thought to be a factor, with Swiss scientists discovering that kids who grow up without pets are more likely to develop allergies.You cant inherit hay fever but some people are more genetically predisposed to have allergies than others.The good news is that although you might develop hay fever in your s, you do generally grow out of it again.Prof Fox said that people tend to stop suffering from it in their s and s.“This is because your immunity begins to decline steadily with age and hay fever is an allergic reaction to pollen and our immune system reacts to this pollen.So as you get older, your immune system loses its ‘oompf’ so older hay fever sufferers tend to have an easier time of it, until their hay fever eases off altogether.”Professor Fox isnt the first expert to notice a boom in late on-set hay fever.Its already been suggested that one million people are set to get hay fever for the first time, thanks to climate change.An estimated  per cent of adults in the UK reported suffering from hay fever in , according to research.Last year that figure increased to  per cent with a million new people buying hay fever medicines and remedies for the first time.The rise is believed to be due to changes in our climateA pollen bomb has put more people at risk than ever, with experts saying that a concentration of lots of dferent types of pollen is triggering allergic reactions in people who have never suffered from hay fever before.So, what can you doyou find your eyes suddenly itching Theres currently no cure for hay fever, but most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment - to a certain extent.. Have more sexApparently, having sex can help to relieve symptoms of congestion.Max Wiseberg, airborne allergen expert and founder of HayMax barrier balms, said: “Pollen levels are set to rise this week so people with hay fever should be prepared to prevent the onset of unpleasant symptoms.“There is also research which suggests that sex could help with the symptoms, so that may be something to consider although there may be some practical issues around timing and locations.“However there is probably not a more pleasant way to deal with the symptoms of hay fever.”The only downside is that the effects are thought to only effect guys who ejaculate - not women.. Avoid pollenThe most effective way to control hay fever is to avoid exposure to pollen.Allergy UK say the best way to do this is to keep windows and doors closed when inside - especially early in the morning and evening when the pollen count is highest.They also advise avoiding peak pollen times and wearing wraparound sunglasses and a hat to prevent pollen getting onto the face and in the eyes.You should also avoid drying clothes on an outdoor washing line and shower when you get indoors to remove pollen from your skin and hair.. AntihistaminesAntihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks its under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction.Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help with clearing a blocked nose.Theyre available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops.. CorticosteroidsCorticosteroidsare used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect.When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed.Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.. Natural remediesMany people are turning towards natural remedies rather than conventional medicine to alleviate symptoms.Some try inhaling steam to clear congestion while others suggest drinking nettle tea - an anti-inflammatory.. ImmunotherapyFor those with persistent hay fever symptoms, a GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment.This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen, such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000484792681.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"los angeles gangsters rappers hollywood a listers photographs","story":"It offers a glimpse into the world of Los Angeles as seen through the eyes of photographer Estevan Oriol, who is famed for chronicling urban culture in the City of Angels.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Mirror readers are concerned about schools, the homeless, feeding their families, climate change, religious extremism and trying to ensure their kids do not grow up worse off than they are. I suspect they really couldn’t care less about Diane Abbott enjoying a canned mojito on a train last week. Yes, she’s the Shadow Home Secretary, and yes, Transport for London have had an alcohol ban in place since then-London Mayor Boris Johnson announced it in . Abbott broke the law. Yet that law was brought in to address anti-social behavior on public transport. Not -year-old pensioners scrolling through their phones minding their own business. So while Susan Hall, who sits on the London Assembly’s Police and Crime Committee, stamped her feet in indignation along with Tory MPs Paul Scully and Bob Blackman, ordinary Londoners were just not that bothered.  In fact, Diane’s succinctly-worded tweet on Friday night both pre-empted the controversy and acted as a verbal eye-roll. “A photo of me drinking from a can of MS mojito on the Overground has been circulated,” she wrote. “I’m sincerely sorry for drinking on TFL.” Cue the hashtags #istandwithdiane and #jesuisdiane as ordinary people made their feelings clear. “I spent the day defending her even though I’m not a fan” wrote one tweeter. Hundreds either posted cans they’d bought in solidarity or selfies they’d taken on public transport holding them in support.  When Christians are among the many faiths being targeted around the world and this country remains paralysed by Brexit, the last thing on peoples’ minds – left or right – is a politician in need of a cold one on a hot day. Clearly Abbott’s critics haven’t been on a night bus, a late-night weekend tube or the summer District Line from Wimbledon after the tennis when el vino tends to flow. The real issue is the enforceability of that  law, described back then by Transport Union general secretary Bob Crow as “a half-baked gimmick designed as a publicity stunt without a moment’s thought for the people told to implement it.” Let’s hear what Abbott’s critics intend to do about addressing that.

But Greta Thunberg is no ordinary teenager – to many she’s a superhero. Eight months ago, Greta sat alone outside Sweden’s parliament, brandishing a banner that read “school strike for the climate”. Now the teen activist is responsible for sparking a global movement that has led to .million pupils around the world walking out of school to join her in the fight against climate change. And she has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Greta has had ­audiences with the Pope, the UN and the European parliament. At the weekend she told Extinction ­Rebellion activists, who staged protests across London and beyond, they were “making a dference”.Yesterday she sat down with ­Environment Secretary Michael Gove, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , Liberal ­Democrat leader Vince Cable and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas in the House of Commons, and the Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts.She arrived in the UK by train, after giving up flying in . There was an empty chair left for Prime Minister Theresa May .Greta’s message is clear – we should be panicking about global warming and it is time for governments to listen to the science. “If your house is on fire then that does require some level of panic. You don’t sit talking about insurance claims and rebuilding – you do everything you can to put out the fire,” she says. “Most emissions are not caused by ­iniduals. They’re caused by corporations and states.” When she addressed MPs in the Attlee Room in Portcullis House it was standing room only – and she wasn’t afraid to take her elders to task.  “Is the microphone really on  Did you hear me  Is my English OK  Because I’m beginning to wonder...” she said. “During the last six months I’ve travelled around Europe for hundreds of hours on trains, electric cars, and buses repeating these le-changing words over and over. “But no one seems to be talking about it and nothing has changed. Emissions are still rising. The basic problem is the same ­everywhere – that nothing is being done to halt, or even slow climate and ecological breakdown, despite all the ­beautul words and promises.” Uncowed by climate change deniers branding her a fearmonger, she has accused politicians and ­corporations of stealing her generation’s future.  “I was fortunate to be born in a time and place where everyone told us to dream big, I could become whatever I wanted to. “Things our grandparents could not even dream of. We had everything we could ever wish for. And yet now we may have nothing. “Now we probably don’t even have a future any more. Because that future was sold so that a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money. It was stolen from us every time you said that the sky was the limit,” she says. She grew up in Stockholm, the daughter of actor Svante Thunberg and opera singer Malena Ernman.  It was a science lesson when she was aged eight that sparked her concern for the planet. “The teachers showed us pictures of starving polar bears and deforestation, plastic in the ocean. I was very moved.” At , Greta says she found herself despairing at the lack of action. “I became very depressed. Nothing was happening. There was no point in anything.” She finally decided the only way to achieve attention for the fight against climate change was to stage a school strike one day a week. Her parents were initially not keen on their daughter missing out on her education. “My parents weren’t fond of it,” she told BBC Radio ’s Today programme.  “But I just kept talking about it and they said, ‘Can’t you do anything   Do you have to skip school to get your message out ’ And I said I was going to do it whether they liked it or not.” The school strikes have since spread around the world, with UK teens joining over the past few months. At the time Greta said: “It’s great England is joining in a major way. People have ­realised just how absurd the situation is. We are in the middle of the biggest crisis in human history and nothing is being done to prevent it.” Like Greta, her mother has given up flying, and her dad has become a vegetarian. He said: “I really didn’t have a clue. I thought we had the climate issue sorted. She changed us and now she is changing a great many other people.”She revealed on Twitter she has ­Asperger’s and says it has helped her. “For those of us on the spectrum,” she said, “almost ­everything is black or white. “You can’t be a little sustainable, you’re either sustainable or not.”On Autism Awareness Day she posted to her million followers on social media how she was “proud to be on the ­spectrum”. She wrote: “Under the right ­circumstances, given the right adjustments it CAN be a superpower.  “I’ve had my fair share of depressions, alienation, anxiety and disorders. But without my diagnosis, I would never have started school striking. Because then I would have been like everyone .” In her calm style, Greta told off our ­politicians, saying: “The UK is very special.

Permitted development rights allow the owner to change a building’s use without planning permission. This gives developers a get-out from requirements to provide affordable housing and meet basic quality rules such as space standards creating ‘rabbit hutch’ flats. Previously they applied only in limited circumstances, such as adding a modest conservatory to an existing home. Conservative changes since  have radically expanded these rules, notably including to let developers turn offices into housing without any planning consent. There have been over , new homes created through this process in the last three years.Labour say it has just changed the definition meaning housing units just a few feet wide in former office blocks are now counted in official statistics as ‘new homes’.Plans for homes in Barnet House, which used to be home to the London borough’s housing department, reveal that % of the  proposed flats will be smaller than the national minimum space standards of  sq metres for a single person. Terminus House in Harlow is a former office block was turned into housing without ever needing planning permission. Earlier this month concerns were raised about the rise in crime in the area. Police figures show that in the first  months after people moved in, crime within Terminus House itself rose by %, and within that part of the town centreby nearly % - to more than  incidents - compared with the previous  months. More than  incidents involved violence or sex crimes. Harlowaposs district commander Ch Insp Matt Cornish said: I am absolutely convinced that Terminus House being at that site is a contributing factor in the increase in crime and anti-social behaviour we are having.    It is just one of many examples of office-to-residential conversion. John Healey MP, Labour’s Shadow Housing Secretary, said: “Conservative permitted development rules have created a get-out clause for developers to dodge affordable homes requirements and build slum housing. “To fix the housing crisis, we need more genuinely affordable, high-quality homes. This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need. “Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs.” The Local Government Association has estimated that over , affordable homes have been lost as a result of permitted development in the last three years alone. While the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors found that permitted development has “allowed extremely poor-quality housing to be developed”, with only % of homes built through permitted development meeting national space standards.

Parents Sophia Vanhecke and Ben Taylor realised she was coming incredibly early and called  at am in the morning.Just two hours later, Hope-Rose was born at Barnstaple Hospital , weighing just over lb.   Sophia said: She was very, very small. So tiny, but apart from that she looked exactly like my other two children when they were born. We called her Hope because it fit the situation. Then the nurse who looked after her and looked after us on the evening she passed was called Rose, so we hyphenated it. After she was born, Hope-Rose was transferred to the neonatal unit at Derrord Hospital. For the next three days -year-old Sophia and Ben didnapost move from her side while machines kept her alive. On April  the family were offered a private room and Hope-Rose was taken off ventilation. She was laid on her mumaposs chest and, in what seemed like a miracle, started breathing on her own. Sophia, a nail technician, said: At first when she began to breathe on her own, without the ventilator, I was really happy and we thought she was going to the the one-in-a-million miracle baby.    It was about  minutes or half-an-hour later that the consultant came and checked her heart and she had passed. The mum, who also has has two older children, Eden, four, and two-year-old Coen, said one of the hardest parts was telling them. Sophia said: My son is too young to understand. My daughter didnapost actually know I was pregnant at all. And because it all happened in the middle of the night she was told I was unwell because we didnapost really know what was happening with Hope-Rose at first. Once she had passed we told Eden that she had a baby sister but she came too early and was really poorly and died. Eden askedshe could go to see her in the hospital in Plymouth. We asked hershe was sure because Hope-Rose was very cold - but she really wanted to go and see her and cuddle her and say goodbye. Instead of celebrating their daughteraposs birth, the couple are now planning her funeral.  And they have a very special request for anyone who sees her funeral cortege - to blow a kiss. Sophia said: I am struggling now. Planning the funeral helps. Although we are having a private funeral in Wrafton, we will have a horse-drawn carriage taking her to the Barnstaple crematorium. I want to ask that anybody who sees the horse-drawn carriage blows her a kiss as she passes. And Sophia also wants to raise awareness of the amazing work of the neonatal team, who she believes could have saved her babythey had been alerted earlier. She said: I want to raise awareness - I donapost think people here speak about or know enough about neonatal death. Also I want to set up a JustGiving page to raise money for the neonatal team. All of the staff at the neonatal intensive care unit at Plymouth Derrord were absolutely outstanding. Words could never describe. The nurses there were Hope-Roseaposs family and always will be. It was sad because I went into labour at home at one in the morning. I dialled  and an ambulance came and took me to AE. I told them I was in labour but they didnapost believe me. For two hours I was saying I need to push.  Because I already have two children I knew I was in labour. I actually gave birth to her in Barnstaple AE. I wasnapost examined by a doctor until quarter of an hour before she was born and he said aposthe babyaposs comingapos. There was no specialist doctor there and no specialist equipment. They called for the specialist neonatal team from Derrord but in the time it took them to drive down they had to resuscitate her three times. The thing that really upsets me is that the consultant saidthe circumstances were dferent a baby born at  weeks - with the right equipment and the right specialist staff - has a  per cent of survival. If they had listened to me when I said I was in labour, they would have had time to get the neonatal team to Barnstaple. It was enough time. Hope-Rose was born without the right environment or staff or equipment. Because of that she had the worst chance of survival. When the Plymouth team arrived they knew exactly what they were doing - they were absolutely amazing. The hardest thing for me is that nobody listened to me. I threw myself on the floor in pain. I knew I was in labour. The pain was excruciating. I kept saying I needed to push and the paramedic said I didnapost need to push it was an infection. The family now plan to set up a JustGiving page to raise funds for the neonatal team.Sophia told Devon Live : All of the staff at the neonatal intensive care unit at Plymouth Derrord were absolutely outstanding.

He was reported to police by the mother of one of his victims.  After Kemlo ed to Scotland, the boy told his mother he had been sexually abused by Kemlo several times while they were playing Minecraft.

Horried Kellie Rice, , from Kirkby in Liverpool had booked Bryn Hyfryd in Anglesey to help raise spirits following her mother-in-lawaposs breast cancer diagnosis. It was described on booking site Sykes Cottages as a magnicent detached retreat which is perfect for families. Despite not having any customer reviews at the time of booking, Mrs Rice felt confident that by booking the five-bedroom cottage through Sykes, they would help should any problems arise.Mrs Rice said told North Wales Live : We booked the cottage back in July last year.  We booked it because my mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer and we wanted a family break away. We went with Sykes - the cottage had no reviews at the time but we thought that by booking with them weaposd get a bit of reassurance. The family of six adults and four children under the age of eight made the journey from Merseyside as planned on Good Friday - a journey which Mrs Rice says took over four hours due to the bank holiday traffic. Mrs Rice said her mother-in-law has a low-immune system due to her cancer treatment. They arrived but claim the cottage was far from the family-friendly retreat advertised.  She said: We got there, opened the door and we were hit with this damp smell. We went to open the fridge to put the food weaposd brought and it was just disgusting. The children were outside playing in the garden while we started to unpack, and they saw that one of the windows in the summer house was smashed in, with glass all over the floor.  It was just dangerous, with shards still sticking out from the frame. The oven, it was absolutely disgusting.  We spent over £ on food for the weekend but there was no way we could have cooked anything in it. Mrs Rice and the adults in the party claimed it wasnapost just the kitchen that needed a clean. When we started looking around there was patches of mould and damp on the walls, she added.    The shelves in the games room had a thick layer of dust. So we called Sykes again and explained that it hadnapost been cleaned before we arrived and it wasnapost in a fit state.  They told us to go out for a bit and they will sort something out. We went to the beach for a few hours. But  Sykes called the family back to say there wouldnapost be time to clean the property and that the booking could be cancelled. The family had paid £ for a four-day stay.  Mrs Rice said Sykes were only able to offer one other property in the area at a cost of £ for the weekend. But she says they werenapost willing to cover the additional cost. The only other ones they offered werenapost even in Wales.  Two in Ireland and one in Norfolk.  I understand it was a  bank holiday and they were busy, but we had nowhere to go and they had our money tied up in the booking.  It was pm on a Friday, and by this point they told us there was aposnothing more they could doapos so we had no choice but to pack up and tell the kids the holiday was cancelled. The kids were devastated. But there was no way we could have stayed there.  It was filthy.  My son has a bad chest and my mother-in-law is recovering from cancer treatment.  Thing is, weaposre not after compensation.  We just wanted a clean house to stay in like we were promised when we booked. But because the only other place that was available was more expensive than what we had paid so they werenapost willing to help. The customer service has been awful from start to finish and itaposs been a horrendous experience.  I just want to make sure no other families go through what we went through. A Sykes Holiday Cottages spokesperson said: “We were sorry to hear about the Rice family’s experience and have provided them with a full refund.  “We did everything we could to offer the guests alternative accommodation, but properties in this location were fully-booked over the Easter bank holiday so this wasn’t available on this occasion.” "},{"url":null,"title":"how save cash waste less","story":"NewsHow to save cash and waste less food by storing things better in the fridgeFrom the correct temperatures to portion control and taking a shelfie - tips you need to save moneyShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsSorting the fridge out properly could save a lot of time and cash \"Get the biggest money stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMouldy cheese, weeks-old ham or a plate of leftovers from your Sunday roast dinner.

So what temperature should your fridge be and which shelves are best for what foods  Read are guide on how to cut down on food waste. It is better for the environment and your pocket too. What is the correct temperature for a fridge    Experts say the optimum overall temperature is between c and c. Aside from food going off before its best-before date, there are several warning signs that your fridge is at the wrong temperature. Modern appliances have a built-in thermometer with some activating an alarmthe temperature drops below or above the optimum range. Condensation on the inside walls means it is too warm as the fridge’s gas is being turned into liquid, which may contaminate food on the lower shelves. If it’s too cold, ice maybe visible at the back. This could also be caused by a faulty door allowing warm air from the outside into the fridge. Donapost overfill the fridge  The more stuffed your fridge shelves become, the harder it is to keep cool. Experts recommend turning down the thermostat by one degreeit is packed. But an empty fridge is not efficient either. To prevent the fridge getting too cold, place a couple of jugs of water on a shelf to fill up space. Or you can turn the temperature setting up a notch. Ideally, a fridge should be around three-quarters full to allow cold air to circulate. Embrace your freezer Many of the items in our fridges will be suitable for home-freezing, which can extend their shelf le massively. It doesn’t have to be on the day of purchase either, just as long as it is before the use-by date. Portion control Avoid cooking too much by sticking to recommended serving sizes listed on packaging.

George Beauchamp is the only person to escape alive from the two worst maritime disasters of the th century. Relatives have revealed how he first survived the Titanic in  and then the Lusitania in . After his second brush with death, he told his family: I have had enough of large ships - Iaposm going to work on smaller boats. George was working as a fire stoker below deck when the RMS Titanic hit an iceberg and sunk in the Atlantic Ocean on April  .  He recalled hearing a roar like thunder on impact and was up to his waist in seawater before being permitted to leave the engine room. He then went up an escape ladder on to deck and helped frantic passengers into a “crowded” leboat before getting in himself. He later told the British Inquiry into the disaster how he helped up to  passengers into Leboat Number . Talking about the impact, he explained he was keeping he engines fuelled at the time: I noticed the shock and then a roar like thunder. We were ordered to close the dampers as water poured through over the plates. We climbed up the escape ladder. “  About helping passengers into the leboat, he told them: I had one foot on the deck and one on the leboat and I was helping ladies and children into the leboat. He explained: “The order was given, aposThat will do that is enough for that boat,apos and I stepped into the boat and went away with it. He told how some ladies had refused to get in the leboat. We had dficulty keeping the leboat away from the shipaposs side and prevent water coming in,” he told the inquiry. We pulled on the oars to get away as far as possible from the suction of the ship as it went down. I saw the ship go down bow first and I could still see the stern and then that went too. It was a roar like thunder as it went down and I heard cries as the ship sank. We would have gone back for others but we were full up. They were picked up ten minutes later by the rescue ship the RMS Carpathia, which saved  people fleeing the doomed ocean liner. Following that ordeal London-born George, remained at sea and is believed to have been on board the RMS Lusitania - when it was sunk during WW. The Lusitania, once the worldaposs largest passenger ship, was torpedoed by a German U-boat on May , , as the Nazis waged war on Britain off the coast of Ireland. His incredible story has come about now as his family, who are from Hull, East Yorks, bid to pay tribute  years after his death.  His great granddaughter, Susan Norton, said: “My mum is quite annoyed that my dad has never really got a mention. It seemed only the officers’ stories are ever told. “I am proud of my great granddad and the part in he played in saving the lives of some passengers.” George was born in London and moved to Hull, where he spent ten years working on trawlers and other ships. He married and had a family in the city before taking a job with White Star Line and travelling to Southampton, Hants, for the Titanicaposs maiden voyage.

On the one hand you donapost want to be the sort of person who stays away and doesnapost acknowledge whataposs happened. But the risk of saying the wrong thing can be terrying.To help with this matter,  The Miscarriage Association have created a range of empathy cards to send to any parent going through a miscarriage.Comprising of four cards, they each feature a simple and heartfelt message on the front.  One example reads, Thereaposs no good card for this. Iaposm so sorry for your loss. To ensure the cards struck the right chord, a  of woman who had themselves gone through pregnancy loss approved them. Ruth Bender Atik, national director of the Miscarriage Association, said of the empathy cards: Shockingly, greetings card retailers stock a card for almost every important le event, except one. These cards recognise miscarriage, and give words to those friends and loved ones who can’t find them.    Losing a pregnancy is heart-breaking and can be very lonely. Close family and friends often don’t know what to say, say the wrong thing, or just say nothing at all. The new cards have been launched to fill that gap.

He said: We were in bed when the incident happened and we heard the collision. Deb turned to me and said aposthat didnapost sound good.apos It sounded as though a car had dented another car, in actual fact it was my sonaposs body that dented the car. Modhwadia, , was found guilty of causing Dylanaposs death by dangerous driving after travelling at mph in a mph zone.    He was jailed for four years and banned from driving for five at Leicester Crown Court. Dylanaposs heartbroken parents continued: We find ourselves in the heartbreaking position of having to do something we never in our worst nightmares thought weaposd have to do. From having to make the devastating decision to turn off our sonaposs breathing apparatus, to having to inform our family and friends that Dylan had been killed - to then planning a funeral for a -year-old boy. Family and friends of Dylan wept in court today as details emerged of Mr Campbell seeing paramedics trying to save his injured son on the roadside near the family home - and the desperately sad moments when he felt the last ebbing beats of his sonaposs heart as he died in hospital.

Full family statement Mr Campbell said in his statement that was read out by Mr Thatcher: As hard as this had been to write we desperately wanted Dylan to be more than just a name in court proceedings. We wanted you to hear what a wonderful boy he was and the devastating effect his loss has had on us, his family and friends. He was a much loved son, brother, grandson, nephew, cousin and friend. He grew up surrounded by love and laughter and as a result was a funny, caring, kind and considerate young man. An avid Cha supporter, Dylan, was studying to be an electrician and had passed his first set of exams although he did not know that as the results were not released until after his death.    The statement continued: He enjoyed going to college and made a lot of new friends there. He showed so much determination to pass his exams, more so than at school, as he was really passionate about the course and didnapost want to let the tutors or himself down.

Kodie Richardsonaposs outburst terried fellow travellers on the flight about to set off from Manchester Airport for Turkey, a court heard.A six-year-old girl and even one member of the cabin crew were left in tears by the incident, the Manchester Evening News reports.The captain who was taxiing to the runway aborted the scheduled departure and turned back to the terminal to ask police to remove Richardson, , and her mum Kelly Meadowcroft - who was also drunk, a judge was told. But Richardson refused to leave her seat before abusing and attacking three police officers who boarded the aircraft to remove her. She even kicked one of them in the face. Now the mother and daughter, both from Wythenshawe in south Manchester, are facing jail sentences.    The drama started moments before Thomas Cook Airlines flight MT to Antalya in Turkey had pushed back from Terminal  at about .pm on September  last year. After taking her seat, Richardson asked fellow passengers for a cigarette and threatened to knock out one crew member while she and her mother Kelly Meadowcroft, , were seen swigging from an open bottle of duty free spirit and disrupted the safety briefing, the court heard. Richardson aimed a volley of foul-mouthed abuse at police when they were called, upsetting fellow passengers. Prosecutor Haseeb Yousaf told Manchesteraposs Minshull Street Crown Court on Tuesday the captain decided to turn the aircraft around as it taxied towards the runway and radioed for police officers to remove two passengers because of their aposunruly behaviour and drunkennessapos. When the aircraft ed to the stand, officers boarded and asked passengers not to take footage as they tried to remove the two women. But aposvery drunkapos Richardson began to scream at the police officers, refusing to leave her seat while her also inebriated mother aposstruggled to put a sentence togetherapos, the court was told. Richardson, who was aposlashing out and thrashing aroundapos, was eventually removed from her seat and taken out of the rear of the plane. She continued to be abusive after being handcuffed and resisted attempts to load her into the cage at the rear of a police van.    Her mother had been aposunsteady on her feet and was slurring her wordsapos, said Mr Yousaf. Three police constables were hurt as Richardson lashed out, the court was told. One officer suffered a cut lip after being kicked in the face while a second suffered a deep cut to a finger. The court heard the abuse continued in the back of the police van, with Richardson telling officers: You fing bitch. I will make sure you are crying you fing c. Some of her comments were too vile to publish. Delayed, the flight was able to resume its journey to Turkey - minus the mother and daughter. When she was finally interviewed at the airport police station, apologetic Richardson told officers aposIaposm sorryapos and claimed she hadnapost intended to assault the officers. The court heard Richardson only had one caution for theft on her record while her mother had  crimes to her name, including for violence. Police bodycam footage was played to the court, showing Richardsonaposs rant at the police officers. Frequently screaming and shouting, she is heard to tell them: Iaposve not done nothing wrong. Iaposm not getting off. With all due respect, Iaposm going to Turkey and my dad has just died. I want to go away. I want to go on my holiday. As police struggled to remove her, she was heard to scream: Get off me. Iaposve not done nothing wrong. Why are you doing it  Get off me now... Youaposre nasty. I want to go home. Listen, listen... you are hurting me. Finally loaded into the back of the police van, she is heard screaming: Take those fing things off me. I want my mum. You are hurting me. You f***ing bitch. Defending Richardson, Huw Edwards told the court his clientaposs remorse was aposgenuineapos. The court heard his client was aposarticulate and cogentapos and that she had apologised as soon as she was interviewed by officers. This was clearly out of character, said Mr Edwards, who added his client has suffered aposdficultiesapos in her le.  Her father had died aposin tragic circumstancesapos in  and her grandfather had also passed away, he said. Mr Edwards told the court his client, when abusing one member of the cabin crew, had blasted aposyour perfect le with your mum and dadapos.

Toby Wilbraham, defending Meadowcroft, said his client, who was said to have been aposobnoxiousapos on the plane, had issues with drink and drugs from the age of . The court heard Meadowcroft, who walks with the aid of sticks because of nerve damage to her legs, felt guilt over her own parenting and had decided at the last minute to join her daughter when her daughteraposs friends, concerned at how Richardson might behave, pulled out. Judge Savill will sentence the pair on Wednesday morning. He remanded the pair, who had been on bail, in custody overnight until sentencing, warning them they could be jailed.

Fans and bookies have been guessing, but the only people who know for sure are the couple themselves. But there are two names which have been floating around which Princess Diana actually rejected for Harry and his big brother Prince William. In Andrew Mortonaposs book Diana: Her True Story - In Her Own Words, he claims the Princess picked both of the names. He claims she said: The alternative was Arthur and Albert. No thank you. There werenapost fights over it. It was just a fait accompli.    Even though they werenapost picked as first names, both did make it in to both princesapos titles somewhere. Wills is William Arthur Philip Louis, and Harry is Henry Charles Albert David. Just as Henry uses the name Harry, his we Meghan also uses her middle name - and her real name is actually Rachel. Bookies believe both names are a possibility for Baby Sussex, with Albert coming in at   and Arthur at  . Royal fans are concerned about the brothersapos relationship at the moment, as there have been rumours of a royal rt.    This was escalated on Sunday when Harry appeared not to speak to William as they joined the rest of the family for an Easter church service in Windsor. Dad-to-be Harry walked to the church several metres ahead of the Cambridges, who followed after him with Zara and Mike Tindall. When the royals lined up at the entrance to St Georgeaposs Chapel he could be seen leaning over to chat to Kate . They exchanged a few words with big smiles on their faces but William, who was standing directly next to Kate, was not included in the joke. While his eye contact with Kate doesnapost break, he doesnapost even glance up at his brother.    Body language expert Judi James believes this may show the feud is growing . She told the :The body language between the two princes here doesn’t just add to the speculation that pair are no longer on speaking terms, it seems to suggest than any rt might have got even wider. When he was single Harry was always forming a tight and happy trio with William and Kate but here it looks sadly as though he is going out of his way to have a lack of communication with his brother. Not only does he arrive and leave walking apart from William and Kate, his antics when William closes in by the church entrance make him look awkward and hints that he could be desperate to avoid him.

Former British Gas engineer Mark Wellings, , became aposobsessedapos with his ex-partner, Helen Hughes, , after she ended their two-month relationship. Rather than move on, Helen says he aposemotionally blackmailedapos her by pretending he had suffered a heart attack and might not survive.He also hacked into her Facebook account to read her private messages and accessed the camera she used to check on her dog and cats while she was out of the house aposto spy on herapos.Helen only realised he was secretly watching her at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, when she heard and saw the camera moving.    After reporting his behaviour to police, Wellings was arrested and in April he appeared at Cheltenham Magistratesapos Court where he admitted stalking and was given a -week prison sentence suspended for  months. Helen - who works night shts in a care home while she completes her degree in social work at Gloucestershire University - said: I met Mark on the morning my marriage ended. He literally walked into my home when my le was at my most vulnerable point. Iaposd called out a British Gas engineer to fix my heating - as I had no hot water - and he showed up. He made an excuse to contact me after completing the work and he said and did all the right things.    I was feeling low and he swooped in and felt flattered by the attention he showed me. But after two months together, I became concerned that the things Mark was saying just werenapost true. When I tried to call it off, he lied about having a heart attack and almost dying. Every time we almost split he claimed to be sick to try and make me feel sorry for him. When we eventually did break-up, he became obsessed.    He hacked into my Facebook to read all of my messages and accessed the camera I used to check on my pets while Iaposm out to spy on me. When I heard it move, I knew straight away it was Mark and I went to the police. I knew enough was enough. His stalking campaign left me feeling unsafe in my own home, but Iaposm just glad heaposs out of my le.  Helen first met Mark in April  when he was called out to her house through his job with British Gas. She said: I was having my Hive wireless heating system fitted on the Friday. A lady came to do it but something went wrong and I ended up with no hot water. I called British Gas again to get someone  to come out to sort it and the next day Mark turned up. It just so happened that my four-year marriage ended that morning.  I was pretty upset so my friend had come over to support me. Mark was in the kitchen and he heard me pouring my heart out to my friend - he later admitted heaposd been listening to it all and snooping at the photos on my fridge. It was like he was scoping me out. We didnapost really talk, I offered made him a cup of tea but that was about it. Iaposve got a few cats and one went near him, he was trying to push it off and made a joke about it - but that was the extent of our interaction while he was in my home.  He was only there for a couple of hours, but about half an hour after he left, I got a text from him askingheaposd left his laptop case in my kitchen. I wasnapost home, but I replied and told him Iaposd check when I got back. He basically struck up a conversation from there but in the end I found out he didnapost even have a laptop case - he never had one - it was just an excuse to get in touch. At first, Helen was flattered by the attention she received from Mark.    She said: He was really friendly in his messages. He seemed very open and honest and seemed to know all the right things to say. It was nice to have someone to talk to about my recent failed marriage that wasnapost close to the situation. We started chatting a lot in messages and then he began popping over to my house for a cup of tea - he was a shoulder to cry on. Weaposd gotten quite friendly and it was nice. It started out as friendship at first, but then he started saying things like he felt like he was falling in love with me. Iaposd just separated from my husband and the attention was nice. It was what I wanted to hear so our friendship developed into romance.  She said she noticed after two months that things didnapost seem right. He became quite obsessive and paranoid, she continued. If I didnapost message him back straight away, Iaposd start to get a withheld number ringing me which was clearly him checking up on me. On one occasion I went to a friendaposs wedding in Scotland and he sent me a message he claimed someone there had sent him - accusing me of spending the night with another man. It was evident heaposd actually just sent the message to himself as there was no one with me. I ignored it for a while but he kept calling and my phone was going off constantly throughout the wedding day. Every time I went away or out, I would get lots of missed calls. It was exhausting and draining. Helen was initially happy in her relationship with Mark but soon felt things werenapost right because he was saying things she believed were untrue.  She confronted him with what she regarded to be his aposliesapos and the couple broke up between September and October last year. Helen said: It was all very stressful and made me feel quite anxious. He also hacked into my Facebook and started sending himself messages from my account. He then had a go at me for sending them. He tried to make out someone  had accessed my account to stir up trouble and cause problems. But the stuff he was saying on there, no one  would have known about. Heaposd read messages Iaposd sent other people on Facebook and would use that information.    I confronted him about the Facebook messages. I told him: aposIaposve got the IP address of where it was logged in, please donapost lie to meapos and he admitted it all. He said heaposd leave me alone, but after that he text me again. He said that now - after talking to me - he felt he could carry on with le, with me being in it he wouldnapost be so depressed. I told him: aposI canapost be that person in your le, you have to make yourself happy. You canapost rely on other people.apos Helen said Mark left her alone for a short period, before things took a sinister turn. She said: I actually didnapost hear from him for a while, but one day I was in my living room - trying to get the jewellery out of a candle Iaposd bought in November last year, when I heard my camera move. It stopped me in my tracks. I had bought the home security camera to keep an eye on my  cats and one dog, Rico, a Yorkshire Terrier rescue, while I was out. The only way the camera could move isI accessed it from the app on my phone and directed it to. I logged into the app and saw it said apostwo viewersapos at the top. I knew straight away it was Mark and I confronted him. I instantly knew it was him so I text him saying: aposBefore you lie, Iaposve got the camera interface so I can see where it can be logged in from.apos I didnapost have it, but I knew it was him and he admitted it too. He was basically spying on me. It left me feeling unsafe in my own home so I told him: aposIaposm going to the policeapos. He spent the day crying down the phone, telling me I was going to ruin his career and his le and that his daughter would be taken away from him. He said heaposd just got engaged to his girlfriend. But I knew it had to stop and he wouldnapostI didnapost take action. With the support of a womenaposs organisation I was working with on my placement at university, I went to the police station to report it. Helen was so upset that she later suffered panic attacks, had trouble keeping food and drink down and wanted to move out of her home. At court, Wellings admitted stalking and was given an -week prison sentence, suspended for  months in April. He was issued with an indefinite restraining order, meaning he must have no contact with Helen and must not go to her home. The judge also ordered him to do  hours of work for the community and  days of rehabilitation activities. She said he would have to pay Helen £ compensation, a £ victim surcharge and £ prosecution costs. She said: I went along to the court case and read my victim impact statement. I was very emotional and had to stop a couple of times. Mark just looked down at the floor and up at the ceiling to avoid looking at me. I thought he might have apologised through his barrister but he didnapost. He knew the right things to say and do. I look back now and think aposwhy didnapost I pick up on that apos At the time, I thought it was lovely that somebody was caring about me that much, but now I realise he was smothering me. When you let someone into your home you donapost expect them to betray that trust or the position they are in.    If someone was to come to your door and tell you theyaposre a convicted stalker and said: aposCan I come in and fix your boiler apos I canapost imagine many people would say aposyesapos. If anyone  is in a similar position to me, my advice would be to go to the police straight away. If they are working for a business and theyaposve got your details through their work go to the top. Itaposs not acceptable. It was only after we contacted the CEO of British Gas that they took action and Iaposve been told Markaposs been dismissed with immediate effect. They apologised and were honest in saying the correct procedures werenapost followed. He should have been suspended straight away and shouldnapost have been allowed to work and go into other peoplesapos homes. Itaposs caused a huge amount of distress seeing him driving around in his British Gas van and felt like a big two middle fingers stuck up at me - like what heaposs done doesnapost matter. Every time I saw a British Gas van I felt sick and as they were everywhere, it gave me a feeling of dread and my anxiety got bad.

Seeing as Loch Ness feeds into the sea at Fort William and Inverness, there are speculations that the well-known animal has taken a trip south.Jacky Sheppard was enjoying a meal at The Little Harp pub in Clevedon, Somerset with her husband when she saw the aposserpentapos shape in the water.   The monster, also known as aposNessieapos, is traditionally recognised as being very large and possessing a long neck as well as one or more humps on its back, sticking out from the water. Jacky said the beast was motoring along the sea from the direction of the Pier towards the Marine Lake.The onlooker explained that the table next to her also saw what they thought was Nessie and hoped they would back her up in a post in the Hello Clevedon Facebook group.In the post, Jacky included a cartoon drawing of the sea creature with a misty background and wrote: aposAny ideas anyone  Polite ones only please!apos    One Facebook user, Susan Cawley, commented that it was Nessie on her holidays. James Hall joked: What were you drinking in the harp, I want some lol. To which Jacky replied: Sadly soda and lime, I was the driver!    Another member of the group, Steve Jones, suggested what Jacky saw was a seal on steroids. Derek Perham didnapost think the sighting was even alive. He said: Depending on the tide there is quite often large lumps of drtwood, including large branches and tree trunks that float past our seafront. Admittedly they always seem rather sinister.

Russian news agency Tass quoted a local official as saying Mr Kim was given flowers, bread and salt at the Hassan train station after crossing the border. Kim arrived Hassan in his bullet-proof train at :am local time, an informed source told news website Vl.ru. Itaposs said the train crossed the Friendship Bridge over the river Tumangang. Kim, who was wearing a black coat and hot, was greeted by the governor of Primorsky Krai Oleg Kozhemyako as he stepped out of the train. The two leaders will meet in the Russian Pacic port of Vlaostok for the first time at a symbolic summit to discuss the international standoff over Pyongyangaposs nuclear programme, according to a Kremlin official. Itaposs said the summit will be held at the campus of Far Eastern Federal University with Kimaposs top aides already making preparations for the event. Pictures emerged showing Kim waving at cheering crowds and officials as he stands on the  before the iconic aposKim Jong-un Expressapos.    Kim has reportedly brought an entourage of  people on board, kicking off a -hour journey towards the north-east. Kimaposs sister Kim Yo-jong was not seen accompanying Kim at the station. According to South Korea media, Kim Yo-jong has arrived in Vlaostok on Monday ahead of her brotheraposs arrival. Kim Yo-jong boarded a flight in Pyongyang for Vlaostok in the morning, a source said. She flew to Russia ahead of Kim John-un to prepare for the summit. The one-of-a-kind luxury train is said to carry a small army of bodyguards and bulletproof cars that can usher the apossupreme leaderapos to safetyhe is attacked. It resembles the armoured transport his father, Kim Jong-il, used for lavish parties during trips to China or Russia - reportedly with lobster, cases of French wine and female entertainers known as aposlady conductorsapos.    The private trainaposs specially-crafted carriages are reinforced with a coat of armour and have tinted windows to hide those on board. The waters around Russky Island, where the school is based, would not be open between Wednesday morning and Friday morning, said the Maritime authorities. Vlaostokaposs central train station would be closed and remained at high security for several days, and local buses will be erted from the train station today, reported local media.    The summit will be the first in eight years since Kimaposs father, Kim Jong-il, visited Russia in , when he was hosted by Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin lieutenant who at the time was serving as Russian president. Kimaposs meeting with Putin serves as a reminder to Washington that he has other options in the region backing his leadership after failed US-North Korea summit in Vietnam two months ago. But while Kim is likely to seek more assistance from one of his countryaposs two main backers, Russia will be limited in what it can provide and the summit will focus more on demonstrating camaraderie than new investment or aid, analysts said.    While Russia says it fully enforces the sanctions that it voted to impose, it has joined China in calling for loosening punishment for North Korea in recognition of steps taken in limiting its weapons testing. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a Security Council meeting last year: Steps by the DPRK towards gradual disarmament should be followed by the easing of sanctions. The US has accused Russia of aposcheatingapos on sanctions and said it has evidence of aposconsistent and wide-ranging Russian violationsapos. In February, Reuters reported a Russian tanker violated international trade sanctions by transferring fuel to a North Korean vessel at sea at least four times between October  and May . One Russian lawmaker told Interfax news agency last week that North Korea had asked Moscow to allow its labourers to continue to work in Russia despite sanctions requiring their expulsion by the end of this year.

That’s the reality of it and we are going to have to do that,” said Jim.“We’ll keep trying, we will keep digging. We’ve let ,, or whatever it was, punters down who were giving us good backing.“Obviously, when the first goal goes in they vent their fury and they’ve got every right because it has not been good enough.“I fully understand where they’re coming from and we take it squarely on the chin.”Jim conceded yet again it was a case of players not doing their jobs as Saints cantered to an easy win thanks to second-half efforts from Scott Tanser and Callum Hendry.“Once the first goal goes in, obviously it was dficult. Again we were on the ball in the middle of the park and give it away. Then we give away the free-kick.The second goal comes from a throw-in which is again not matching a runner. It’s a simple throw-in back to the wide player and it’s a simple cross and it’s not good enough.“That’s not doing your jobs and it’s jobs that we work on, jobs that they know exactly what’s expected of them in those key areas and that’s why we’ve been punished.“It’s a major disappointment. We were so guilty of giving the ball away in key areas.“I felt we showed a lack of quality on the ball and St Johnstone fed off it, the amount of times they picked the ball up from a slack pass from us and broke.”"},{"url":null,"title":"emirates-a380-inside-luxurious-double-decker-jet-as-it-comes-to-glasgow","story":"THIS is an inside look at Emiratesrsquo huge and luxurious ldquosuperjumbo jet

supporters had to wait more than  years to celebrate a win over Rangers in Glasgow – now defender Scott McKenna aims to deliver four in one season.The Dons travel to Ibrox on Sunday gunning for a fourth victory over the Gers on the road.Victory would be unlikely to stop Rangers finishing ahead of Aberdeen in the race to finish second in the Premiership.However, it would complete a memorable clean sweep over an expensively-assembled Rangers side on their own turf, while also effectively securing European qualication for the Dons.Aberdeen have knocked Rangers out of both domestic trophies this term with wins in Glasgow and also triumphed - in the Premiership, with McKenna scoring the vital winner.Now he is desperate to deliver the quadruple over Rangers in their home city.McKenna, . said: “We have a fantastic record at Ibrox this season, as we have won twice there.“It is always a dficult place to go but we have proven to ourselves that we can win at Ibrox. We will be looking to do the exact same again on Sunday.”The Dons had to endure a wait of almost  years to secure a victory at Ibrox since a - success in September .In the interim period there had been one solitary win in Glasgow, defeating Rangers - in the League Cup semi-final in October  on the way to lting the trophy under Roy Aitken.At Ibrox that long drought stretched to  failed attempts until Derek McInnes led the Dons to a - win in May .It was a catalyst that led to the Reds’ impressive form in Glasgow against a Rangers side rebuilt by Steven Gerrard this season at a cost in excess of £ million.Scotland cap McKenna said: “We don’t get caught up with the crowd or the atmosphere . We just deal with the game that is in front of us and in previous encounters we have come out on top.”Victory at Ibrox would not only take Aberdeen a step closer to European qualication for a sixth successive season, it could also ensure Celtic, who host Kilmarnock  hours earlier, can win the title this weekend.That would prevent the possibility of the Hoops bidding to secure the title at Pittodrie the following Saturday.McKenna is only concerned with moving the Dons closer to confirming a third-placed finish and automatic spot.He said: “We have been in Europe for a number of years now and it is up to us as players to make sure the club continues getting there.“We still have four of the best teams in the league to play but over the course of the season we have done pretty well against them in those games. We just have to use our experience from games previously in the season and pick up points.”McKenna headed home the goal as Aberdeen defeated Kilmarnock - to leap-frog the Rugby Park side into third.In an ill-tempered match, Killie had three players sent off. After Aberdeen had two players red-carded and both boss Derek McInnes and No. Tony Docherty sent to the stand in the - Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic, McKenna insists it was vital they kept their cool amid the chaos at Killie.He said: “It was a bit of a battle and there probably wasn’t much football played. After last weekwe had to keep our discipline, as we couldn’t afford to lose any more players.“We battled away and managed to get three points in the end.“It was a massive result for us. “Hearts lost earlier in the day and with us winning it moved us  points clear of them.”Centre-back McKenna scored his second goal of the season with the winner at Kilmarnock.His other goal secured a - Premiership win at Ibrox on December .He said: “I should probably have scored a couple in the first half against Kilmarnock.“I put one wide and did not get enough contact on another.“The balls into the box were excellent and gave us a real chance of attacking them.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb9e0028a67e3.92278824.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet base star and daisy are looking for a new home can you help1","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This whirlwind of excitement and energy is Base!

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"bank injects tens thousands pounds","story":"NewsBank injects tens of thousands of pounds to revamp Ayrshire branchGiant lodges application with councilShareByStephen Houston:,  APR NewsAyr High Street branch, Bank Of Scotland\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMajor investment is being made to spruce up the Bank of Scotland in Ayr.

Grandfather Alex Kelly, who is chairman of South Ayrshire Crime Prevention Panel, said: “It was Saturday night about  o’clock and we had been for chips in Ayr. “My grandson wanted to go down to the seafront for a shot on the new tower. “I thought I would just stay in the car and let him go ahead but I could see there were a few teenagers, aged  or , hanging about. “My grandson was off and running and away up the inside of the tower. “The next thing I knew he was shouting for help at the bottom of a chute.” Alex added: “He told me what had happened and I wasn’t too happy. “I also saw a dad take his wee girl from inside the tower as she was intimidated by the older kids on it. “I didn’t want to confront the teenagers but I did phone the council. I don’t think it’s acceptable to let teenagers intimidate children in these circumstances. “There should be some kind of supervision that doesn’t involve the police, although the council seems to think the police should be involved.” Alex, of Maybole, reckons there were six young teenagers at the top of the tower, three boys and three girls. He said: “In the good old days we had park keepers to deal with this kind of thing.” A council spokesman said: We are happy that our play parks are popular, but anyone using them should act responsibly. There are plenty of places for parents, s and carers to supervise their children in the play park.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"dynamite plan give ayr great","story":"NewsDynamite plan to give Ayr a great futureAll sorts of buildings such as Matalan, Odeon and Waterfront pub would come downShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBack in use - the old rail bridge would become an inner ring road \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA radical plan to rescue Ayr town centre has been published – and it’s sure to provoke astonishment. That’s exactly what the creators of the Bruce Plan want in a bid to stimulate a real future for the stricken town. The #AyrDeservesBetter campaign want people to sign up to the cause for real action. And Rob Close, chief writer of the -page document, said: “We want real action not yet another expensive consultant’s report. “We have written this for free – now we want our elected leaders to actually do something.” The details of the Bruce Plan – named after King Robert who routed English troops from Ayr – can only now be revealed. The controversial idea, devised by Rob, a Mastermind contestant and Radio  Brain of Britain finalist, involves flattening buildings throughout the centre. And that includes working businesses: ● Matalan ● Mr Basrai’s World Cuisines ● The Odeon ● Sports Direct ● The Tam o’Shanter petrol station ● The Waterfront bar restaurant Wrecking balls will also be brought in to demolish the old Orient cinema Babylon nightclub. This is a key part of the new inner ring road which would utilise the old rail bridge over the River Ayr and replace a traffic system regarded as bonkers. The railway station would finally be annexed from the old hotel and built several hundred yards south at the old Townhead yard. The group see this as “critical” to the future of Ayr. It is thought Network Rail would favour this as certain s at present cannot take the extra long trains now required on the route. The bus station would be relocated to the Matalan Sports Direct site.And the Stagecoach bus station would become part of a new culturalquarter.Rob Close, an historian and architectural author, is working closely with architect Pat Lorimer, the spokesman for #AyrDeservesBetter. Rob said: “I appreciate some may disagree and that I have made no attempt to cost it. “But the cost of doing nothing and allowing the town to crumble in the face of unrelated decisions by successive South Ayrshire Council administrations is much more of a risk – financially, socially and aesthetically. “I feel this plan begins to look like a town that many more of us will want to live in. “People can have a go at itthey wish, but at least it gives us something to focus minds on.” The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think-tank of Ayr partisans. Miller Road and Fort Street would become part of the inner ring road, with the historic Sandgate largely access only. This ring would slice through the Orient cinema site, cut through the Aldi car park, the Waterside bar and into Fort Street. Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre. Unlike some towns there are physical constraints such as the river, bridges and railway line that cannot be moved.The #ADB advocates the entire bottomend of the High Street no longer beinga shopping area, and all businessesclustered from the centre towards the top of the town, anchored by the Ayr CentralMall.Businesses in Miller Road including LA Bowl would be encouraged to relocate to the central core and for it to become largely residential again. South Ayrshire Council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. The group proposes the Station Hotel becomes council offices and the railway buildings on the other side of the track to become social enterprises. #AyrDeservesBetter say the town centre developed piecemeal over the past  years without an overal plan. With  empty shops and buildings there is now need to have compression rather than an expansive retail area.Matalan or even Marks  Spencercould become tenants in the Hourstons building.Details of the Bruce Plan also call for no methadone prescriptions in the town centre. A free bus would operate to include the river and seafront and parking for the first three hours would be free. Extra parking could be created on the old Afflecks factory via Sandgate. It is mooted a public competition to re-design Burns Statue Square after the Odeon and Burns House are brought down. A cultural quarter of town would include the Gaiety Theatre, Mecca Bingo, the nightclubs of Arthur Street and the Mercure Hotel. The Plan states: “Some of the ideas for rescuing Ayr could be re-located here, such as LA Bowl and Fury’s from Nile Court.” Rob hopes the ideas can gain traction and adds: “I know such a scheme will come to fruition onlythe council, and our national governments, show the will and find the money.” And Pat Lorimer acknowledges it might be pie in the sky, but said: “It is very important pie in the sky. “At the moment people are twiddling their thumbs and thinking about putting a traffic island here or there. “This is radical.” To get behind the new movement email info@ayrdeservesbetter.org.uk.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14418225.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_070319bypass_01JPG.jpg","title":"maybole bypass could create up","story":"NewsMaybole bypass could create up to  jobs, says the Scottish GovernmentThe official award of the construction contract has fired the starting gun on the long-awaited project.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsAn overview of the bypass route \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe project to build a bypass for Maybole could employ up to , it has been claimed.

The new bypass will benefit drivers on the A and opens the way for new investment and redevelopment in Maybole.It is disappointing that the Scottish Government chose not to fully dual the bypass, missing an opportunity to futureproof the road, but it’s still a major step forward for the area.This is an important investment but there’s much more that could be done to improve the A along its entire . Instead of resting on their laurels with this investment, I’ll continue to challenge the Scottish Government to set out a long term plan for further bypasses and more dual carriageway that will bring the A up to the standard drivers expect from a trunk road and help grow the economy across Ayrshire.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish GovernmentAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"new 40m leisure centre ayr","story":"NewsA new £m leisure centre for Ayr High Street will open in Arran Mall is earmarked for flagship facilityShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new £ million leisure centre for Ayr High Street is due to open in  the council has revealed.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: other. “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"wellswood property week","story":"NewsWellswood is property of the weekNeighbouring homes have sold for £, or moreShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailOne of the lovely villas on the right as you head to the Brig O’ Doon is seeking a new owner.

A handy office has a window to the rear and there are three double bedrooms, one of which is en-suite. The modern family bathroom has a bath and separate shower. The loft is floored so feasibly there is room to supersize. Outside the mature gardens offer a pleasant mix of soft and hard landscaped areas including extensive lawn with mature trees and borders.

The event involved a successful partnership between South Ayrshire Council, Scottish Rowing, University of West of Scotland and Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. And it’s believed to be the first time in  years that an organised water-based activity has taken place on the River Ayr. The event was designed to encourage young people to interact safely with the river and get fit and active at the same time. Many of the participants will be undertaking Duke of Edinburgh Gold Awards in the summer and this event was the perfect warm-up. All the young adults were given a safety briefing by representatives from Scottish Rowing, the council and South Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. They were then allocated their equipment before the group all had the opportunity to try out a single scull, open canoe and a costal boat, setting off along an m course. During the day they all received expert tuition from experienced rowers and instructors. Belmont Academy pupil Alex Crooks, aged , said: “It was something new, a new experience. “I’m doing canoeing for my Duke of Edinburgh award, so it’s about getting experience of the water and the river. I enjoyed it.” Ben Gilmour, aged , a pupil at Prestwick Academy, said: “It was good. “We get out and do free things and it’s good way to spend your time, instead of playing the X-Box! “I do sailing and I do figure skating but I’ve never come out and done loads of watersports . “This has been good and you get to meet new people as well.” It’s hoped that the programme will spark renewed interest in rowing and watersports, given the River Ayr’s proximity to Ayr Academy. Backing the event was the RNLI , who through their Respect the Water campaign, were able to reinforce the key messages about staying safe. The participants were also given a waterproof mobile phone cover, along with literature about water safety, as a thank-you for taking part. Tess Crooks who goes to Belmont Academy said: “It was a fun and enjoyable day, I would like to do more and get to learn new skills on the water.” Ryan Matthews, an apprentice from GE Caledonian, said: “It was a very enjoyable experience and good training for my DofE Gold canoeing expedition later in the summer. “It also made me realise the fitness required for this type of activity and how I need to get fitter.” Councillor William Grant, Children and Young People Portfolio Holder for South Ayrshire Council, said: “South Ayrshire has outstanding natural resources available to everyone. “This is a great way for young people to explore nature, increase their confidence and learn new skills at the same time. “We need to respect all our waterways but rivers should also be enjoyed and the young people taking part clearly had a great time thanks to the expert supervision.” Vincent McWhirter, RNLI Volunteer Community Safety Officer said: “We have  miles of coast line from Barassie to Ballantrae with four main rivers and numerous lochs all of which are very attractive but can also be potentially dangerous, so it was really worthwhile to teach the young people new skills and at the same time learn about the hazards but in a fun way.” If you are interested in taking up rowing, you can contact Scottish Rowing https:www.scottish-rowing.org.uk , Ayrshire Coastal Rowing Clubs: Troon

see how the Greenpower project is expanding within the Borders as I was responsible, along with my students, for building the first Greenpower kit car four years ago.ldquoThe project allows students to develop not only their knowledge and understanding of STEM subjects, but teamwork and cooperation.Mark Catto added: ldquoIt was brilliant watching all three teams supporting and working with each other, and the effort that Dave Black and Paul Watson put into these groups is immense.ldquoOverall, four trophies was a brilliant result considering two of the teams had only been together for a few

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

sports pitches, were formulated last year.However, public consultation showed little appetite for any changes to be made.Dunbar Community Council received word on Monday evening that a further consultation was being planned, despite the apparent lack of interest in any alterations.George Robertson, community councillor and chair of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership , noted that there was no funding available to make any of the proposals happen.He said: ldquoIt is a wishlist of things ndash it is not going to be happening any time soon.ldquoThat is the long and the short of it.ldquoIf you are interested in the future of the park obviously come along to the meeting and have your say but do not expect anything to happen any time soon.Included among the ideas is the possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge.

Some of it went to him... It was a matter of admission that he attended meetings at which the loans were discussed, agreed and authorised.ldquo[Ms Ahmed-Sheikh] claimed to have accepted [his] assertion that the monies borrowed by the practice belonged to him.ldquoIn the tribunalrsquos view she should certainly have appreciated the true position when she had been informed of the background to the establishment of the trust and was a trustee of the client trust.ldquoShe failed to consider the matter even when the firm started borrowing from the trust. She must have known this borrowing was essential to the viability of the firm. This is particularly serious in light of her position of Cashroom Manager. The lack of investigation and inquiry into these most basic facts is a signicant failing. It said the pair ldquocompletely failed to apply their minds to the status of the funds and the nature of the relationship of the Trust with the firm.ldquoIt would have been obvious from the firm balance sheet that the firm was being supported by loans from the Trust. The Respondents were Trustees of that Trust.The tribunal went on: ldquoIn financially dficult times, when the practice unit [the firm] was living day-to-day, and the loans were required to pay staff salaries, all partners and the Cashroom Manager in particular should have been examining the accounts of both the trust and the practice unit very carefully,for no other reason that to satisfy themselves that loans could continue to be madethe practice unitrsquos finances did not improve.ldquoTo continue for so many years without making any investigation into the trustrsquos status was a serious and reprehensible departure from the standards of competent and reputable solicitors.ldquoIt appeared to the tribunal that they had completely failed to consider the matter and their responsibilities.The tribunal said the financial records for the trust were ldquoin such disarray it was impossible to tellit even had a positive balance in the relevant period, though all loans have since been repaid.The Tribunal also rejected the solicitorsrsquo argument that they had not breached any rules about borrowing because the trust was ldquoin the business of lending money.It said: ldquoThere was no evidence that the Trust was lsquoin businessrsquo, for example tax liability or registration.. the only loans the Trust made were to the practice unit [the firm].ldquoThe practice unit borrowed money from the Trust. The loans were essential for the viability of the firm. The Respondents were both Trustees of the Trust and managers of the practice unit. There was an inherent conflict in lending and borrowing in these circumstances.Ms Ahmed-Sheikh said: ldquoThe findings of the Tribunal reflect what was decided and announced at the hearing in January. It is now accepted on all sides that in the words of the Tribunal there lsquowas no suggestion of dishonesty or lack of integrityrsquo.ldquoThe case turned on whether I should have realised that the family Trust in the name of my senior partner Mr Mickel, to which there was no financial loss, should be treated as a client of the firm. The Law Society accepted my view at the time was lsquowrongly held but genuinersquo.ldquoI, in turn, accept that my view was mistaken in the terms of the Law Society Rules. Thus the Tribunal censured and fined me and I have accepted that decision.

First, remember Enoch Powellrsquos edict that ldquopower devolved is power retained, so, from the start, devolution was not what it was cracked up to be. The economy is a matter retained to Westminster, yet when Scottish economic figures are disadvantageous, successive Scottish Secretaries have challenged successive Holyrood First Ministers about what they are going to do about it ndash but when the figures are favourable, that was due to that actions of Westminster governments. In the post-war years, they had poured extra money into Scotland to thwart the rise of the SNP, but the much-praised Barnett formula under-funded our block grant from the straight population ratio basis of year-on-year enhancements. Except that the - Conservative government put more in that the formula allowed, so our  per cent per capita lead remained instead of being reduced to single figures, giving the impression that Barnett was responsible, thus enhancing the case for devolution.Unionist MPs for English constituencies at Westminster, even those born in Scotland, used Scottish Questions to ask for how long their voters were going to have to continue to subsidise ldquothese Jocks from their taxation  When UK welfare measures were implemented, we had imposed on us the so-called bedroom tax . That was not required here, as traditionally, the problem was solved by voluntary exchanges to suit new circumstances. Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson challenged Nicola Sturgeon, thatshe was not content, to remedy the situation . When the SNP raised income tax to cover it, it was met with a torrent of abuse from Ms Davidsonrsquos own party for ldquomaking Scotland the highest tax-paying region of the UK, even though the Conservatives were instrumental in ldquogranting Holyrood the extra tax powers in the first place.So, grievances all around.The irony is that it was the ineptness of the Unionist parties that effectively handed power over to the SNP ndash they had lost sight of the direction of travel of politics in Scotland.

notably impatience in the Yes ranks - mean she must say something.She has been chivvied by the Scottish Greens to give her update, and has angered some of her MPs by appearing to prioritise a Peoplersquos Vote on Europe.Her spokesman got somewhat shirty when askedthe timing was connected to party conference.However the FMs options for action are limited.Theresa May refused to grant Holyroodrsquos request for a Section  order, saying ldquonow is not the time, and her foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt recently ruled out granting another.Ms Sturgeon has no route of appeal other than to the court of public opinion.She has ruled out a Catalan-style wildcat vote, knowing it would end in a legal quagmire rather than independence.So her next move is likely to be a fresh push for a Section  order, even though it is in effect the status quo, as Holyrood never rescinded its previous request.Mrs May or her successor will not grant it.It is hard to imagine any Prime Minister, of any party, agreeing to yet more constitutional turmoil in light of Brexit.However a second refusal could be weaponised at the next Holyrood election in , with the SNP citing it as further evidence of Westminsterrsquos lack of respect for Scotland.Ms Sturgeon could also try to revive that draft Referendum Bill.Almost nothing has been heard of it since of it since mid-.Despite the absence of a Section  order to give it legal bite, it could in theory be formally introduced at Holyrood as a contingency measure and a political tool.However, Ms Sturgeonrsquos official spokesman said on Tuesday there would be no documents or legislation published alongside tomorrowrsquos statement, so maybe not.What is clear, even amid the ldquoongoing Brexit confusion as her spokesman put it, is that the time to hold a second independence vote is running out.The next Holyrood election, when Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate expires, is barely two years away.Given the legislative hurdles and statutory campaign periods, there is very little time to hold a second independence referendum within the current parliament.If there was a Peoplersquos Vote first, it would make an independence referendum impossible because of time pressure, nevermind it potentially stopping Brexit and removing the sole example of ldquosignicant and material change cited in the SNP manesto.The SNP has also yet to draw up a coherent final prospectus for independence.More than four and a half years since Ms Sturgeon became its leader, the SNP will only now, at this weekendrsquos conference, debate which currency should be used after a Yes vote.There is disagreement and discontent on other fronts too.The chances, before , of the SNP securing a Section  order, finalising a prospectus, passing legislation, and mounting a winning campaign in the face of polls showing a stubborn majority for No, are therefore vanishingly small.Ms Sturgeon may concede this tomorrow, and set her partyrsquos sights on the next Holyrood election instead, or she may keep up the pretence with another Section  order request.Either way, the outcome is the same."},{"url":null,"title":"five-eyes-intelligence-members-to-share-stage-in-uk-for-first-time","story":"UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand representatives will meet at the National Cyber Security Centreannual conference CYBERUK in Glasgow on Wednesday.They will discuss their experiences and how they work together to defend against shared cyber security threats during a public session at the Scottish Event Campus.It is the first time the five members of the alliance have done so in the UK.NCSC chief executive Ciaran Martin said: \"Cyber security is an international team sport and we are delighted to host allies from around the world in this public way to discuss how we best defend from common adversaries.\"Cyber attacks do not respect international boundaries and many of the threats and vulnerabilities we face are shared around the globe.\"Each nation has sovereignty to defend itself as it sees best fit but its vital that we work closely with our allies to make the world as safe as possible.\"Members appearing from Five Eyes are Mr Martin, Rob Joyce, from the US National Security Agency, Scott Jones, head of the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security, Scott McLeod, of Australias Assure and Enable, and Jan Thornborough, of New Zealands National Cyber Security Centre.Specialists from across government, industry and law enforcement will attend the two-day summit.It will include speeches from GCHQ director Jeremy Fleming and Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington.The theme of CYBERUK  is to develop good cyber security for the public and help to make the technology they buy more secure.Around , security experts are expected to attend the conference.Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: \"The UK is one of the leading cyber powers in the world -

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Last week, in the Barmulloch Residents Centre at a meeting of community activists in the north of Glasgow, I heard once more first-hand about the impact that austerity is having on the lives of thousands of people.The campaigners and representatives of community and faith groups spoke in clear and moving terms about the consequences of cuts to our social and economic fabric: an increase in isolation, rising mental health issues especially amongst young people, the scourge of low pay and the impact of universal credit.Powerful testimony of the personal as well as the community-wide fall-out of austerity. But they also described the impact of cuts in their own funding: one organisation facing a  per cent overnight reduction, another,  per cent. These organisations are the glue that help hold communities together. At the close of the meeting, I spoke to the press, and I was asked by a journalist from this newspaper, about my views on the sht that is taking place within the SNP over their policy on currency.It is highly topical: at its conference next weekend, the SNP is likely to back a far riskier currency policy than even the one that caused them so much dficulty during the  independence referendum. They will now decide on whether to move towards a separate Scottish currency with “a decision on establishing a new currency by the end of the first term of an independent parliament”.But the question is also directly and immediately relevant to those organisations and communities at the sharp end of austerity in communities like Barmulloch. Not least because austerity isn’t evenly spread across society. We are not all in it together.The possibility of Scotland having a new currency creates further uncertainty. Communities and organisations in Barmulloch – like their counterparts across Scotland – seek stability and sufficient funding to meet their needs.: Case for separate Scots currency after independence is weak, say expertsMoving to a new currency increases instability with respect to wages, prices and funding. A prosperous, fairer Scotland will not be achieved on the back of a new currency. Then layer on to this the SNP’s Sustainable Growth Commission that proposes a five-to-ten year period of deficit reduction to get Scotland’s deficit below three per cent. That would mean unprecedented levels of austerity for public spending and has been widely criticised, including by the left of the SNP’s own independence movement.These two economic policies would lead to even greater austerity than we have witnessed over the last decade. This is not only my assessment but that of former SNP MP and economist George Kerevan.And this represents the sum total of the economic policy being developed in the SNP as their blueprint for independence. It is not merely the opposite of progressive economics, it is very bad economics.Two things strike me about this, in the context of that Glasgow community event and the profound questions it posed.One, the brutal reality of the SNP’s new currency, alongside their cuts programme, is thin gruel for the public. None of this  is a solution to the very real problems that I am hearing at community events around Scotland. More to the point, in every regard, they would make them considerably worse. And two, the preoccupation with nationalist projects of one sort or another has the effect of erting away from the real, harsh and pressing problems facing people. Because while our political system is preoccupied with all of this, it is not considering the radical steps that should be taken to rebalance our society and eradicate its worst social ills. That must change.The truth is that in the midst of the great challenges of the st century, our politics is bound up in competing nationalisms that bury everything beneath endless process. They not only ert us from the greater questions we ought to confront – they offer no coherent solution to them. Nationalism is an insufficient prescription for the great social, economic and environmental challenges we face.: Kenny MacAskill: Why SNP shouldn’t get in fankle over Scottish currencyAfter all we live in extraordinary times. The most powerful nation in the world is led by its worst President in living memory. Whilst the USA turns on itself, the Chinese economy continues to power China’s growth as a global force, an historic sht in the balance of the global financial and economic system. Asthis was not a big enough moment, the clock is ticking on the existential threat of climate change. Climate school strikes and the Extinction Rebellion protests are clear enough indicators of how far-removed mainstream political elites are from resolving the threat to our planet.This week MSPs willfrom the Easter recess at a time when people are deeply pessimistic and gravely concerned about the chaos of leaving one major economic market. It does not draw most people towards a second independence referendum but rather for the vast majority strikes a salutary note of caution.And we are now gearing up for elections to the European Parliament. That itself is already a defeat for Theresa May. We must not allow this election to become a  choice between competing nationalisms: British and Scottish. In fact one of the challenges is to defeat the right-wing populism of Farage and his former party Ukip, and help build a movement for radical reform and real change where the language of priorities is decent jobs and fair pay, an end to poverty and overcoming inequality, good homes and affordable rents, high-quality public services and genuine equality. The Party of European Socialists is calling for an end to the economics of neo-liberalism and for a new social contract along these lines, as part of the construction of a fairer Europe.

In fact I first discussed it with Robin Cook when he was leading on Lords reform for the Labour government nearly  years ago.“He saw it as a big challenge but one which would reflect the fact that devolution had happened but that there still remained issues about representation in the English regions.“So I support the idea enthusiastically but I am concerned about the way it is developing. I do not think that a Senate should be established to help save the union, or to replace the EU as an over-arching body. Those would be the wrong reasons for such a big constitutional change. It should be about how do we revitalise democracy, how do we improve our democratic system and people’s engagement and how do we ensure the country is governed properly.”Tory MSP Murdo Fraser published a paper on Monday for the Bright Blue Scotland thinktank in which he recommended a post-Brexit “quasi-federal” constitutional settlement including abolishing the House of Lords and replacing it with a Senate of elected members from across the UK.The paper argued that the current political arrangements are inadequate and support for independence in dferent parts of the UK will increase unless there is constitutional reform.Mr Fraser said: “With nationalists in dferent parts of the United Kingdom seeking to use Brexit uncertainty for their own political ends, it is important that unionists have a coherent response. Introducing a UK-wide Senate delivers the long-awaited and overdue reform of the House of Lords, giving a better balance to the UK constitution and protecting the interests of the nations and regions furthest from London.”Baroness Pauline Bryan, thepeer appointed by Jeremy Corbyn to develop constitutional policy, had previously published a paper which called for a ‘total reform’ of the House of Lords and a ‘new relationship’ between Scotland and Westminster. The document takes the party much closer to backing full federalism and the abolition of the Lords, with a new second chamber likely to take its place. Baroness Bryan said: “The point is to change the relationship so that the Scottish Parliament is no longer subordinate to Westminster. A second chamber of the Regions and Nations would change the nature of the relations to shared government on the cross territorial issues.”Lord McConnell said: “I am quite excited about the level of support this idea is generating, those of us who have supported it for years have been in the wilderness. But it should be done because it restores democracy, not used as just a political tool or as a sop to deal with nationalism. “Nor do I think it should be a mix of appointed and elected people - the appointment system of the Lords needs to end entirely, not just partially.“For me, the benefit of a Senate of Nations and Regions is that it would breathe new political le into the country outside of London where there is still too much focus, and allow many new voices to be heard in a revising, second chamber.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon set to unveil party s scottish independence plans","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon is being urged to #take independence off the table# as she prepares to make a statement in the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday on her plans for a second referendum.The SNP leader will make a “detailed and substantive” address to MSPs on Wednesday afternoon on Scotland’s future in light of the Brexit turmoil and set out her thinking on the staging of a second independence referendum, which she has pledged to hold.It comes ahead of the SNP conference this weekend when the party will step up its campaign for a second vote on leaving the UK, by adopting a new flagship economic policy that would see an independent Scotland adopt a stand-alone currency after a Yes vote.But pro-union parties have called for an end to the constitutional wrangling.Tory interim leader Jackson Carlaw said: “Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to be judged on education, yet here we see her passing up the opportunity to talk about that very subject.“Instead, she’s ing to her real priority, her plan for a isive second referendum on independence.“The only reason this statement is happening at all is because Nicola Sturgeon put a second independence referendum back on the table following the EU vote. “And she has obsessed about it ever since.”Ms Sturgeon’s address will last half an hour and the SNP leader will then take a further hour of questions from MSPs.“The First Minister will give a detailed and substantive statement, setting out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster,” a spokesman for the SNP leader said. “The First Minister will take time to set out her thoughts on that front and, in doing so, she will seek to strike an inclusive tone.”He added: “It will cover the situation in respect of Brexit, where things have reached in recent weeks and months.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave. She insists this represented a “material change” in circumstances which opened the door for another vote.The pro-independence majority at the Scottish Parliament, combining SNP and Green MSPs, has also voted in favour of a second referendum being held.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tam dean burn on lost at sea this is an epic story that gets right inside a community","story":"The last time Tam Dean Burn appeared in a Perth Theatre production, it was the winter of -. Margaret Thatcher had recently been elected prime minister, the post-punk rebellion against all things Establishment was in full swing and although the young Tam knew that he was lucky in conventional terms to have won a vital first theatre job as an acting ASM with Joan Knight#s legendary Perth company, he frankly felt that there were other places he would rather be.Back in Edinburgh and Glasgow, he had been closely involved with the radical playwright George Byatt, whose Theatre PKF had already scored a left-field success with his brilliant, fantastical theatrical poem The Clyde Is Red. Another Byatt play-with-music, Why Does The Pope Not Come To Glasgow, had caused a stir at the  Edinburgh Fringe. Dean Burn also played in a band called The Dirty Reds, and – as a born and bred Edinburgh lad – was closely involved in the burgeoning Edinburgh indie music scene around the Fast Product record label, run by Bob Last.“Punk had had this enormous impact on us,” says Dean Burn, talking of an Edinburgh generation that also included luminaries like Irvine Welsh, and musician Davy Henderson of the Fire Engines. “I just felt that there was so much going on in Edinburgh and Glasgow at the time, in both music and theatre and then I had to go away and be in Perth for seven months. I did want the possibility of a career as an actor, though and when they told me I would lose my new Equity cardI left, I decided to stick it out.”The whole episode, in other words, was typical of the rich creative tension that has shaped Dean Burn’s le as an actor, theatre-maker, musician and radical activist. To the wider public, he is probably best known as a familiar face in films and television series that range from River City to the recent BBC series The Victim, starring Kelly Macdonald. Last month a -year-old-man appeared at Edinburgh Sherf Court charged with attempted murder following reports that Dean Burn had been stabbed just after leaving the Scottish Poetry Library where he spoke at a tribute event. Throughout his acting le, Dean Burn has continued to work in theatre as well as on screen, to play in bands including his current ensemble The Bum-Clocks, and to explore the wilder reaches of radical theatre, criss-crossing art-forms, and often wearing his socialist and anti-Establishment politics on his sleeve. And now, all of those strands are coming together for Dean Burn, in the project that has brought him back to Perth.Morna Young’s new play Lost At Sea is an intense piece of personal history, shaped by Young’s own experience as the daughter of a fishing family in the tiny north-east coast village of Burghead. When she was five years old in , her fisherman father Donnie Young was lost in the North Sea and after an early career as a journalist in London, Morna Young has spent the last eight years gradually putting together the material she needs – the stories, the memories, the recorded interviews around the community where she grew up – to tell both the story of his death and the wider history of the industry in which he worked, and which has always exacted such a heavy price from Britain’s coastal communities. The result, says Dean Burn, is a vital piece of recent working-class history, told in the voices of the people who lived it, through songs, choruses, and powerful visual images, as well as dialogue and the sheer quality of the team that has been attracted to it – which includes former Traverse and West Yorkshire Playhouse director Ian Brown, composer Pippa Murphy, and a superb nine-strong cast led by Dean Burn with Gerry Mulgrew of Communicado – is perhaps a measure both of the intense quality of Young’s play, and of the current lack of powerful working-class drama in British theatre.“For me, this is a great epic story that uses a chorus of voices to get right inside a community, in a way that only someone who belongs to that community could do,” says Dean Burn. “Morna lost her dad to the sea, and also other family members, in this profession that’s so ancient it almost transcends time, and yet is now struggling to survive. “Like everything  in our society, the fishing industry has been distorted and corrupted by capitalism, in particular by the way the British government chose to make EU quotas and licences tradeable commodities. Yet when people are lost, fishing communities often find it too painful to go back and ask why and that’s why Morna’s work is so important: because she has been able to persuade a community shaped by these experiences to talk about it, and to be part of making this play.”He adds: “Back in  I took part in the first-ever reading of Lost At Sea in Lossiemouth, very near Burghead and it was an extraordinary experience. I don’t think I’ve ever been part of a performance that meant so much to an audience. These are communities that often don’t look outward, don’t expect the wider world to understand their lives that’s one reason why the Doric language is still so strong with them. But Morna speaks and writes that language, in a wonderfully theatrical way and now, I’m really thrilled to be part of this great team, bringing the le of that community, and what it tells us about our society, to audiences all over Scotland – and maybe beyond.” Lost at Sea is at Perth Theatre from  April until  May©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk. She became very agitated when I pointed out to her oral and general health was no better nor worse than many of my overseas immigrant patients. Needless to say, I was cascaded with a barrage of insults and threats. Thankfully she and her like-minded bigots blocked me on Facebook, thank God for small mercies!I made a conscious decision to stop going to muslim countries  years ago because I saw what was about to happen. Sitting watching a ramadan service on state televisionI was not already aware of what was coming the imam made it quite clear what should happen to the likes of us. I really do suggest you go find out for yourself Peter. To anyone  I say stay away and take the word of those who know better.Very sadly many, many religions have a few thugs and bigots in their ranks posing as priests. Islam and Christianity both have plenty of corrupted teachers and perverted followers. That has absolutely nothing to do with Brexit, but all to do with sectarianism and racism. As I said Islamophobia is alive and well on Shetland, fortunately, such views held by an unpleasant and ignorant minority."},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/2108-21-September-12-150x150.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand."},{"url":null,"title":"riann s passion is a work of art","story":"THERE isn#t much Riann Coulter doesn#t know about Irish artists and her enthusiasm is infectious. As curator of the council-run F.E. McWilliam Gallery, Irish art is her specialty and it all started with F.E. McWilliam himself.The Trinity Art History and English graduate, who went on complete a Master’s Degree in Modern Art at the Courtauld Institute of Art in London, first nurtured her interest with an A-Level art project on the McWilliam Studio – now part of an external exhibit at the titular venue where she works.It has been an intriguing journey for the former Banbridge Academy student and one which has brought her full circle after stop-offs in Dublin, where she took her first job in the Irish Museum of Modern Art, and in New York as a researcher on American patronage of Irish art.Happily, her job is also her passion and it is hard not to be swept away by the Coulter bonhomie - an oddity in the raried stratosphere of the art world today.But opening up the joys of all types of art to visitors from all backgrounds - including renowned works by established artists to stunning offerings from up-and-coming students - is her mission and she will not be deterred.Even diners in the popular cafe at the gallery are surrounded by art and unwittingly soak it up. It is in the gardens, on the walls and in the display cabinets. It is probably even in the food. You may not always see it, but art is a state of mind as much as anything  and this knowledgeable and friendly curator is determined to help you source it out.“We get very interesting responses from people who come in to view the ious exhibitions and it is great to observe them,” says Riann. “Comments range from, ‘That’s rubbish’, to a deep moving in the soul. That is how it should be art is an emotional response and it is okay not to like some of it - as long is you engage with what you see and you know why you don’t like it, it’s fine by me.”So far, there hasn’t been much not to like. Virtually every exhibition staged since she took the job in  has proved a success and her latest project - the definitive ‘Blackshaw at ’ collectionis a case in point.Organising the Blackshaw exhibition has probably been the highlight so far,” she says. “And it has been brilliant that we got it first - before it goes to Dublin. Usually it’s the other way around.”For this latest exhibition she literally stripped the paintings from people’s walls in homes across Ireland, from Cork to Sligo, and acknowledges the “generosity” of collectors happy to part with their treasured ‘Blackshaws’ for the duration of the show. The artist himself, a now frail and introverted character who shuns the limelight, was even persuaded to attend the opening night although he didn’t take to the microphone himself when it was time for speeches. Unquestionable integrity of school principal and Naval Reserve officer Simon Harper Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"“Basil doesn’t like crowds, so it was great to have him here in person,” says Riann. “We have  paintings in total, charting his early work up until the style he had developed while in his seventies. He told me he was still painting today, but his hands aren’t what they used to be and he was disappointed it had taken him two weeks to complete a composition, when in his younger days he would finish a painting in two days.”The next exhibition planned for when the Blackshaw exhibits are dismounted in October is a display of work from talented members of Banbridge Camera Club - yet another move to pass ownership of gallery space onto the local community.“We like to try to engage with all types of art - traditional paintings, modern abstracts, crafts or visual art,” Riann explains. “It is a case of trying to make everyone feel there is something for them, no matter what their age or outlook.”The best bit of her job, she says, is discovering new talent, while the worst is falling in love with the art on the gallery walls and wanting it herself - her real weakness is spying a surreal, quirky take on something traditional, although she also loves mulling over “small, quiet paintings” as well.Then there are the long days leading up to opening nights: “It can be stressful, pulling everything together for an exhibition, but you learn to get by on adrenalin,” she smiles. “Resources are always an issue in the Arts and we work with a small team here, so you can go home feeling quite knackered.”When she does go home, it is to physicist husband David and toddler son Callan - already showing a prodigious interest in art “by drawing on the furniture” - but she finds it dficult to ‘switch off’.“Art is part of daily le and even on holiday I am always popping into art galleries to see what’s new and interesting,” she adds. “We work three years in advance, so I have to forward-plan a lot.“I think we are very lucky here in Banbridge. There is so much home-grown talent on our doorstep and we have this great venue in this great location. “Galleries can sometimes be intimidating places but it is our aim to engage with everyone and provide the complete visitor experience through workshops, lectures and supper evenings We have also just set up a ‘Friends’ of the gallery organisation which has proved really popular and brings people together.”And she goes home happiest when she sees someone react to what is in front of them: “Once I saw a woman cry over a painting because it touched her in special way. Art is such a subjective thing and that is the beauty of it. It doesn’t really matter what it makes you feel, as long as it makes you feel something.”"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic and","story":"The Department for Infrastructure has warned motorists to expect icy conditions on roads in the north, west and south of the Province tomorrow morning.

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of .

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38043970.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/PSNI_Road_Policing.jpg","title":"driver caught doing 122mph on treacherous northern","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lyra’s answer would have been simple, the only way to overcome hatred and intolerance is with love, understanding and kindness,” they said.The family also made the statement on behalf of their spouses and Ms McKee’s nieces and nephews.They thanked their local community for their “outpouring of support and love,” adding: “We ask everyone who knew Lyra to continue her message of positivity and hope, by respecting her memory with dignity and respect.”Sara Canning, Ms McKee’s partner, said previously: “Our hopes and dreams and all of her amazing potential was snuffed out by this single barbaric act.”A -year-old woman arrested on Tuesday morning by detectives investigating the murder has now been released unconditionally.Detectives from PSNI Major Investigation Team are continuing to appeal for help from the local community in Creggan or anyone with information.Two men aged  and  were initially arrested in connection with the killing but were later released without charge.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Floral tributes have been left at the spot where journalist Lyra McKee was murdered The New IRA is an amalgam of armed groups opposed to the peace process and it recently claimed responsibility for parcel bombs sent to London and Glasgow in March.Police believe the violence was orchestrated in response to an earlier search by officers aimed at averting imminent trouble associated with this week’s anniversary of the Easter Rising.The statement said: “On Thursday night, following an incursion on the Creggan by heavily armed British crown forces which provoked rioting, the IRA deployed our volunteers to engage.“We have instructed our volunteers to take the utmost care in future when engaging the enemy, and put in place measures to help ensure this.“In the course of attacking the enemy Lyra McKee was tragically killed while standing beside enemy forces.“The IRA offer our full and sincere apologies to the partner, family and friends of Lyra McKee for her death.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Friends of murdered journalist Lyra McKee defaced the walls of a dissident republican office SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the statement was an absolute disgrace, that showed no remorse for the death of Ms McKee.“Their so-called instruction to their ‘volunteers’ to ‘take the utmost care’ when engaging in violence is utterly sickening and devoid of any humanity,” he said.He added: “The murder of Lyra McKee must not be in vain. Together, political leaders must come together to re-engage in a talks process to fill the vacuum that currently gives groups like this too much oxygen.”Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said: “First, their spokespeople dismissed Lyra McKee’s murder as an “accident”. Now, the New IRA accept responsibility for her murder, while asking their members to be more careful when trying to murder people in future.“To be clear, killing a police officer is every bit as wrong as killing a journalist. Both are there doing their job. Both of them have families who care about them. Neither deserve to be shot in cold blood.”Police in Northern Ireland say the investigation into the killing is continuing at a “rapid pace”.Detective Superintendent Jason Murphy said more than  people had contacted officers with information, adding: “This was an attack on the community. Lyra, tragically, was a random victim and I need the public to continue to support us.“Many witnesses have contacted us to give us information that has been provided to them.“More than  people have contacted us via our MIPPwith messages, including mobile phone footage.”Mr Murphy appealed for witnesses or anyone with information to come forward."},{"url":null,"title":"lyra mckee vigil in dublin organised by trade union attended by hundreds","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Russian news agency Tass quoted a local official as saying Mr Kim was given flowers, bread and salt at the Hasan train station after crossing the border.Preparations for the meeting in Vlaostok, a port city on the Pacic, on Thursday, were held in secrecy because of North Korean security concerns, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said.Mr Ushakov said the talks would focus on the standoff over the North’s nuclear programme, noting that Russia will seek to “consolidate the positive trends” stemming from US president Donald Trump’s meetings with Mr Kim.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Kim reportedly inspected an honour guard before leaving The secretive leader will be the first North Korean premier to travel to Russia since his late father, Kim Jong Il, visited in .Mr Kim has had two summits with Mr Trump, but the latest in Vietnam in February collapsed because North Korea wanted more relief from sanctions than Washington was willing to give for the amount of nuclear disarmament offered by Pyongyang.Some experts say Mr Kim could try to bolster his country’s ties with Russia and China as he has increasingly expressed frustration at the lack of US steps to match the partial disarmament moves he took last year.It is not clear how big of a role Russia can play in efforts to restart the nuclear diplomacy. But the summit could allow Mr Putin to try to increase his influence in regional politics and the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear programme.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  A worker adjusts the flag of Russia and North Korea along the road in Russky Island, off the southern tip of Vlaostok, on Tuesday Mr Putin’s adviser added that the Kremlin would try to help “create preconditions and a favourable atmosphere for reaching solid agreements on the problem of the Korean Peninsula,” Mr Ushakov said.He pointed at a Russia-China roadmap that offered a step-by-step approach to solving the nuclear standoff and called for sanctions relief and security guarantees to Pyongyang. He noted that the North’s moratorium on nuclear tests and scaling down of US-South Korean military drills helped reduce tensions and created conditions for further progress.Mr Ushakov said the Putin-Kim summit’s agenda will also include bilateral cooperation. He added that Russia’s trade with North Korea is minuscule at just  million dollarslast year, mostly because of the international sanctions against Pyongyang.Russia would like to gain broader access to North Korea’s mineral resources, including rare metals. Pyongyang, for its part, covets Russia’s electricity supplies and wants to attract Russian investment to modernise its dilapidated Soviet-built industrial plants, railways and other infrastructure.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Mr Kim has had two summits with US President Donald Trump In the meantime, Vlaostok has been seeing a number of unusually strict security measures. Maritime authorities said on Tuesday that the waters around Russky Island, off the southern tip of Vlaostok, would be closed to all maritime traffic between Wednesday morning and Friday morning.The island, which is home to a university with a conference hall, is seen as a likely summit venue.Separately, local media reported that some s at Vlaostok’s main train station would be closed for several days, and that buses will be rerouted from the train station on Wednesday.News website Vl.ru reported that municipal authorities undertook road works to make the entryway in and out of the train station less steep — presumably to allow Kim’s limousine to drive straight out from the ."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah jessica parker settles breachofcontract suit with jeweller","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have too easily forgotten that failure in our politics always results in danger in our streets.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated.

Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

This simply isn’t good enough. @allianceparty candidates in the borough are  , we worked hard as an association to achieve this. More needs to be done to address the barriers women face to entering politics.”Connie who has campaigned for marriage equality in Northern Ireland said she would love to see the council promoting more LGBT+ events in the borough.A steady Alliance presence on Ards and North Down council may reflect a more liberal inclination in voters in the area, though it’s hard to see any nationalist other than the SDLP’s Joe Boyle sitting in this unionist dominated chamber.Ards and North Down is a staunchly Christian council reflected by the fact that meetings begin with prayers.Veteran politician Mr Boyle has been a mainstay on the council, also running unsuccessfully for MLA since .The party recognises there are no gains to be made in Ards and North Down as Mr Boyle remains the only candidate they’ve fielded across seven electoral areas.Sinn Fein similarly aren’t going gung ho to crack the council area, fielding just two candidates – Murdoch McKibbin in Ards Peninsula and Kieran Maxwell in Bangor West. The DUP currently have  seats on Ards and North Down council and few would predict a major change in that power base. The next highest represented party is the UUP with nine seats and Alliance with seven seats.Council election: Unionists in Mid Ulster urged to turn out and vote, despite SF dominanceTUV leader: Lyra McKee was fair and courteous and professional Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rather than a straight fight between the UUP and Alliance for those  seats, it’s likely both parties will retain their numbers and seek to pick up extra seats from Independent candidates and the likes of the Green Party and the TUV.A total of  candidates will be vying for  seats in the council area.Bangor Central will be the most contested DEA within Ards and North Down with  councillors vying for six seats.Given the DUP’s position of power they have been able to field a new candidate for the Bangor Central – politics student James Cochrane, who is running alongside Alistair Cathcart and Wesley Irvine.Another one to watch in Bangor Central is Noelle Robinson who was elected on to council as a Green Party candidate but has since become an Independent councillor.She left the party following comments from Green Party leader Steven Agnew when he said that he did not see the point in making it illegal to be a member of a terrorist organisation.YOUR CANDIDATESArds Peninsula candidates to be elected out of Robert Hugh Adair, DUPJoe Boyle, SDLPAngus Carson, UUPMatt Davey, UKIPNigel Edmund, DUPLorna McAlpine, AllianceMurdoch McKibbin, Sinn FeinTim Mullen, Cons and UnionistMichele Anne Strong, GreenEddie Thompson, DUPBangor Central candidates to be elected out of Craig Blaney, UUPAlistair John Cathcart, DUPJames Cochrane, DUPKaren Douglas, AllianceStephen Dunlop, GreenIan Henry, UUPWesley Graham Irvine, DUPMaria Lourenco, IndependentRay McKimm, IndependentJohn Montogomery, UKIPGavan Reynolds, IndependentNoelle Robinson, IndependentFrank Shivers, Cons and UnionistBangor West candidates to be elected out of Connie Egan, AllianceBen English, Cons and UnionistJenner Mary Gilmour, DUPAlan Graham, DUPBarry McKee, GreenKieran Maxwell, Sinn FeinMarion Smith, UUPScott Wilson, AllianceBangor East and Donaghadee candidates to be elected out of Mark Brooks, UUPDavid Alan Chambers, UUPBill Keery, DUPPaul Leeman, Cons and UnionistJanice McArthur, DUPPeter James Martin, DUPHannah Irwin McNamara, GreenTom Smith, IndependentGavin Walker, AllianceComber candidates to be elected out of Ricky Bamford, GreenStephen James Cooper, TUVTrevor Cummings, DUPRobert Gibson, DUPDeborah Girvan, AllianceJohn Montgomery, DUPMichael Palmer, UUPJohn Sloan, IndependentPhilip Smith, UUPHolywood and Clandeboye candidates to be elected out of Roberta Dunlop, DUPStephen Gordon Dunne, DUPGillian Greer, AllianceTim Lemon, UUPCarl McClean, UUPAndrew Muir, AllianceAndrew Turner, Cons and UnionistRachel Elizabeth Woods, GreenNewtownards candidates to be elected out of Naomi Armstrong, DUPPaul Robert James Corry, UKIPIan Dickson, UUPColin Kennedy, DUPBen King, IndependentMaurice Macartney, GreenAlan Joseph McDowell, AllianceStephen McIlveen, DUPNick Mathison, AllianceJimmy Menagh, IndependentRichard Smart, UUPtry catch  TrendingRat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant -

It was tested on February .ldquoThere appears to be disagreement between Penarth Quays and the Vale over the safety facilities needed to operate the bridge and minimise the impact on neighbouring houses and businesses.The Association is now campaigning for it to be reopened.A spokesperson for Penarth Quays Marina said: ldquoWe are obligated to operate the bridge based on an agreement made in , but the bridge was built to standards applicable in . Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Russian news agency Tass quoted a local official as saying Mr Kim was given flowers, bread and salt at the Hasan train station after crossing the border.Preparations for the meeting in Vlaostok, a port city on the Pacic, on Thursday, were held in secrecy because of North Korean security concerns, Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said.Mr Ushakov said the talks would focus on the standoff over the Northrsquos nuclear programme, noting that Russia will seek to ldquoconsolidate the positive trends stemming from US president Donald Trumprsquos meetings with Mr Kim. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Kim reportedly inspected an honour guard before leaving  --The secretive leader will be the first North Korean premier to travel to Russia since his late father, Kim Jong Il, visited in .Mr Kim has had two summits with Mr Trump, but the latest in Vietnam in February collapsed because North Korea wanted more relief from sanctions than Washington was willing to give for the amount of nuclear disarmament offered by Pyongyang.Some experts say Mr Kim could try to bolster his countryrsquos ties with Russia and China as he has increasingly expressed frustration at the lack of US steps to match the partial disarmament moves he took last year.It is not clear how big of a role Russia can play in efforts to restart the nuclear diplomacy. But the summit could allow Mr Putin to try to increase his influence in regional politics and the standoff over North Korearsquos nuclear programme. -- vw,vw,px, px\"A worker adjusts the flag of Russia and North Korea along the road in Russky Island, off the southern tip of Vlaostok, on Tuesday  --Mr Putinrsquos adviser added that the Kremlin would try to help ldquocreate preconditions and a favourable atmosphere for reaching solid agreements on the problem of the Korean Peninsula, Mr Ushakov said.He pointed at a Russia-China roadmap that offered a step-by-step approach to solving the nuclear standoff and called for sanctions relief and security guarantees to Pyongyang. He noted that the Northrsquos moratorium on nuclear tests and scaling down of US-South Korean military drills helped reduce tensions and created conditions for further progress.Mr Ushakov said the Putin-Kim summitrsquos agenda will also include bilateral cooperation. He added that Russiarsquos trade with North Korea is minuscule at just  million dollarslast year, mostly because of the international sanctions against Pyongyang.Russia would like to gain broader access to North Korearsquos mineral resources, including rare metals. Pyongyang, for its part, covets Russiarsquos electricity supplies and wants to attract Russian investment to modernise its dilapidated Soviet-built industrial plants, railways and other infrastructure. -- vw,vw,px, px\"Mr Kim has had two summits with US President Donald Trump  --In the meantime, Vlaostok has been seeing a number of unusually strict security measures.

principal and naval reserve officer simon harper  ","story":"An international rugby star and a former education minister are among those who have paid tribute to Portadown College principal Simon Harper who died suddenly while on holiday in Scotland.Past pupil Rory Best said he was “incredibly saddened” at the news, while Peter Weir MLA described Mr Harper as having played a “crucial role” in the Northern Ireland education system.Having taught at Rathfriland High School and Regent House in Newtownards, Mr Harper took over as principal of Portadown College in .“He played a crucial role in local education and many will join me in mourning his passing,” Mr Weir said.“I think we’d have been on a very similar page. I met him on a couple of occasions, and I think there was a strong, burning desire in his heart to preserve the best of education for all our young people.”Ulster and Ireland rugby star Rory Best tweeted: “Incredibly saddened to hear of the sudden loss of Mr Simon Harper, principal of my former school @pcportadown. Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.try catch  TrendingPortadown College principal dies suddenlyTribute paid to Portadown College

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
