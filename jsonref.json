Meghan Markle imagined here wearing the gown she is rumoured to wear on her wedding day, at the Ralph \u0026amp Russo fashion show at Paris Fashion WeekWill Meghan’s wedding dress impact the bridal industry?Meghan, like Kate Middleton, is likely to choose a dress from a British brand in order to curry favour with the public and in turn, boost the nation’s valuable fashion and bridal industries.Despite the Meghan Markle effect being an industry in itself, being valued at £150 million to the British fashion industry in the form of unofficial brand endorsements, the new Royal’s impact on the bridal industry may be more subtle.After Kate Middleton’s marriage to Prince William, some bridal designers decided to replicate the Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen dress with hopes that all those who had watched the Royal Wedding would want to purchase a wedding dress similar to hers.According to Lori Conley, Senior Vice President of Product and Design at David’s Bridal, the recreated dress with lace sleeves, plunging neckline and full skirt did not sell. ‘We have internal benchmarks we work with to understand traction of a dress. It feel below those.’While women were inspired by Kate’s look, they did not want to feel as if they were in a costume, so bridal designers are expected to take elements from Meghan’s dress after May 19 and incorporate them in their new collections.However, before the 2011 Royal Wedding, 75 per cent of wedding dresses that David’s Bridal sold were strapless, but after, around 65 percent of brides opted for something with more coverage, from straps to full sleeves.          Kate Middleton seen here on her wedding day with her Maid of Honour and sister Pippa Middleton at Westminster Abbey in LondonIn the same way, Kate’s second wedding dress sparked an interest in sashes, Brides magazine Deputy Digital Director Roberta Correia told Racked that bridal designers are still being influenced by this accessory seven years on.‘Long sleeves, V-necks, and lace have been seen all over the bridal runways since, even at the most recent Bridal Fashion Week. H\u0026ampM released a new dress as part of their wedding collection, which looked almost exactly like Kate’s,’ Roberta said.Although there is high consumer interest in what Meghan wears, trend adoption is slower in the bridal industry, but some brands, like minimalist brand Floravere have already announced that they will have styles inspired by the dress ready within days of the Royal Wedding.Floravere CEO Molly Kang said: ‘As soon as she goes down the aisle, we can see what’s going to explode, whether it’s silhouette, fabric, or neckline.’Royal Wedding dressesWhile Meghan has somewhat disregarded the unspoken Royal dress code when it comes to her day-to-day fashion, she is expected to go for a traditional and classic bridal gown for her big day, similar to what other Royal brides have worn before her.The Queen’s wedding dressQueen Elizabeth II wore a timeless dress designed by the favoured royal couturier Norman Hartnell for her marriage to Lord Philip Mountbatten.The Duchesse ivory silk-creation took three months to complete and had a heart-shaped neckline with a scalloped edge, crystals and a 13 foot patterned train. Like all British brides at the time, the Government gave her 200 extra clothing coupons towards her wedding trousseau.          This picture was taken during the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh showing the couple at Buckingham PalacePrincess Margaret’s wedding dress Princess Margaret, the Countess of Snowdon and The Queen’s sister, was seen in a non-traditional dress made from silk organza in what was dubbed the most glamorous wedding of its time, in 1960.During her first marriage to Antony Armstrong-Jones, the Princess wore a modern dress with a skirt comprising of 30 metres of fabric, also designed by Norman Hartnell.Critics claimed it was the simplest wedding gown in history, yet beautiful and sophisticated and can be seen as part of a display at Kensington Palace in London.          Princess Margaret and Anthony Armstrong Jones seen here on the balcony of Buckingham Palace on their wedding day with one of the Princess\u0027s bridesmaidsPrincess Diana’s wedding dressAt the time, Lady Diana Spencer’s wedding dress was known as the ‘most closely guarded secret in fashion history’.Designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the meringue style gown was worth £9,000 in 1981 and is now valued at approximately £36,800.For her wedding to Prince Charles, Diana’s dress was made of ivory silk taffeta and antique lace with what has now become an iconic 25 foot train.

Shortly afterwards, when asked how he was feeling, he said: \u0027Great, thanks. How are you feeling?\u0027Meghan O\u0027Shea, aged seven, from Holyport in Berkshire, was among those who chatted with Harry.The prince noted the \u0027H\u0027 in the little girl\u0027s name - like his soon-to-be wife Meghan - and she said he remarked: \u0027Is that like the one I\u0027m going to marry? There\u0027s not very many Meghans with a \u0027H\u0027 around.\u0027Little Meghan said of her namesake: \u0027I think she\u0027s very nice.\u0027 As Harry was returning to the castle, he spotted a friend in the crowd who has made it home from a big cycling trip just in time for the wedding.Dean Stott, 41, travelled the 14,000-mile Pan American Highway in 99 days, 12 hours and 56 minutes, knocking an astonishing 17 days off the previous best. The former special forces soldier trained with the prince for six weeks in 2007 and the pair have stayed close, with the groom-to-be finding time to congratulate his guest on the record-breaking achievement.Afterwards Mr Stott said it was the first time he and Harry had seen each other since he returned, adding that he had not quite realised the magnitude of the wedding. Mr Stott said he was \u0027honoured and privileged\u0027 to be attending the wedding.   Accompanied by his older brother, Harry was met with loud cheers from the crowd as he emerged from the castle wearing a grey jacket, white shirt and slacks          \u0027I just want to go to the pub!\u0027: Harry pointed at the Horse and Groom pub behind adoring fans and photographers in Windsor this evening           Harry and Meghan are pictured among a crowd of well-wishers in the groom\u0027s final public appearance as a single man          Harry holds a teddy bear with a red jumper as he and Prince William greet crowds outside Windsor Castle this evening  Prince Harry walks around in front of Windsor Castle as he greeted well-wishers on his last evening of bachelorhoodAt tomorrow\u0027s service the bride  will walk through the Nave and Prince Charles will be waiting  at the start of the Quire - half way down the chapel - to take her to the altar.A source told MailOnline: \u0027It was something that she made clear she wanted to do when she and Prince Harry started planning their wedding last November\u0027.Many royal fans appear delighted at Meghan\u0027s decision because Charles does not have a daughter - but some critics believe the star, 36, should have plumped for Doria.The dramatic twist came as Prince Philip, 96, confirmed he will be well enough to attend the ceremony after successfully recovering from a hip operation last month. Harry\u0027s father is vastly more experienced than Doria at appearing at large-scale public events amid intense scrutiny. He also performed the duty for Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016. Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.       One member of the adoring crowd gave Harry what is possibly his and Meghan\u0027s first wedding present - a fluffy teddy bear    Outside the Horse and Groom pub, Harry shook hands with fans and spoke to children in the crowd while well-wishers filmed his every move on their mobile phones           Prince Harry is given the teddy bear by one of his well-wishers outside Windsor Castle this eveningThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aisleOprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansPetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingCameras cut away just as Meghan is about to curtsy to the QueenDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionIn a statement, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Ms Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel on her Wedding Day.\u0027The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms Markle to The Royal Family in this way.\u0027Until today Prince Charles was the second favourite at 31 yesterday to walk Meghan down the aisle, with her mother Doria Ragland the favourite at 13. Third favourite was Prince William at 51. Her half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr., was pictured outside Windsor Castle this week after flying to the UK ahead of the service.  The royal bride will hope there are no further surprises from her family to disrupt the build-up to the wedding. Ms Ragland has already enjoyed a \u0027jolly\u0027 meeting with Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, just hours after landing, and yesterday met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children.           Harry, looking relaxed wearing an open-necked white shirt and light jacket, waved to the crowds and chatted to his brother before making a beeline to talk to a young girl waiting among the crowds outside          Fans carrying royal wedding memorabilia were out in force tonight as they poured into Windsor to wish Prince Harry well before he ties the knot with Meghan tomorrow            The prince gives photographers and members of the public a thumbs up as he chats and jokes with people who gathered in Windsor tonight           Royal fans use their phones to take pictures of a smiling Prince Harry as he appeared outside Windsor Castle this evening    These ladies managed to secure a perfect vantage spot for seeing Prince Harry greet the public for the final time as a bachelor  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle looked relaxed as their Range Rover took them to Windsor Castle today with just a day to go until they marry  The couple waved and chatted in the back of their Range Rover while arriving at Windsor around an hour later (pictured)          Meghan looked happy and relaxed despite a tumultuous few days caused by her father\u0027s paparazzi deal and poor health          Meghan asked Prince Charles to give her away after her father dropped out at the last minute and the heir to the throne was seen entering the Windsor Castle estate todayThe surprise walkabout by the brothers echoed the eve of William\u0027s own wedding in 2011 when the pair greeted royal fans with an impromptu public appearance on The Mall in central London          Prince Harry waves and holds the teddy bear he was given by one of the well-wishers as spectators take their own pictures          Harry and William surprised royal well-wishers with a walkabout outside Windsor Castle the night before the wedding          Prince Harry smiles broadly with Windsor Castle and crowds of well-wishers in the background the night before his wedding  Prince Harry waves and gives a thumbs-up to members of the public as he steps outside Windsor Castle this evening          Harry smiles as he greets some of the thousands of royal enthusiasts who have descended on Windsor for the ceremony          William smiles as his brother Harry shows him the teddy bear which he was given as a gift by one of the crowd of royal fans          Prince William meets members of the public who have gathered outside Windsor Castle ahead of the royal wedding          Prince Harry and Prince William meet the public during a pre-wedding walkabout, outside the Horse and Groom pub          Prince Harry gives royal fans a thumbs-up as some of the people waiting outside Windsor Castle take pictures of the groom          Harry smiles for one royal spectator\u0027s camera as he goes for a walk outside Windsor Castle with his best man William          Prince Harry reaches into the crowd to greet well-wishers outside Windsor Castle hours before the royal wedding          The Duke of Edinburgh is to attend the royal wedding to see his grandson Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle, Buckingham Palace has said.Philip, 96, has been recovering after undergoing a hip operation.The Duke was spotted at the Royal Windsor Horse Show last week - the first public sighting of the Queen\u0027s consort since he left hospital last month. The Duke was taken to the private King Edward VII hospital in central London on April 3, for surgery to replace his joint with a prosthetic implant.He underwent the planned procedure the following day and left hospital on April 13.The duke, who retired from royal duties in August 2017, has since continued his recovery in Windsor.His appearance at tomorrow\u0027s wedding will please the royal fans, with whom he is extremely poplar.                                                     Last night royal fans were seen camping out outside the castle to ensure a good view of the planned procession, using sleeping bags and even folding chairs after local police banned tents. Yesterday they witnessed a full rehearsal in which a carriage and members of the armed forces paraded through the streets of Windsor. Meghan has pleaded for her 73-year-old father, who is recovering from heart surgery in Mexico after revelations about his alleged collusion with a paparazzi photographer, to be given \u0027space\u0027. In the statement, which she is said to have written herself, Miss Markle, 36, said: \u0027Sadly, my father will not be attending our wedding.\u0027I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\u0027I would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u0027 Amid criticism from some in the extended Markle family, sources close to Miss Markle yesterday insisted that she and Harry, 33, had offered both her parents substantial \u0027support and advice\u0027 as to how to handle the global interest since they started dating in 2016.And friends told the Mail that contrary to claims by her half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jnr, that she had left their intensely private father to deal with the paparazzi on his own, she had been in \u0027frequent\u0027 touch with him by phone and text, including in recent days.It is understood Mr Markle told his daughter personally that he would not be medically fit enough to fly to the UK.  It was claimed yesterday that he was recovering after having three stents implanted in arteries following a heart attack at home in Mexico eight days ago, and that he had said it would \u0027take a long time to heal\u0027.In return, Miss Markle was said to have told him that she loved him and supported him, regardless of the paparazzi photograph debacle.            A man puts a flag up above a shop featuring Harry and Meghan decorations in Windsor ahead of the royal wedding           People with Canadian flags camp out in Windsor ahead of the wedding of Harry and Meghan tomorrow          A group of royal wedding enthusiasts hold up flags and Harry and Meghan memorabilia outside Windsor Castle  The Royal Standard flies over Windsor Castle showing the Queen is in residence with the tow below a sea of Union Flag bunting today          In the town huge crowds of people have gathered on the eve of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding in the grounds of the castlePolice, the Army and the security services are forming a £30million ring of steel to protect the couple and the 100,000 people expected to visit the Berkshire town - but some armed officers took the time to pose with some Meghan fans  Royal fans from Britain, America and around the world are gathering outside Windsor Castle in huge numbers today with many wearing flags, costumes and hats          Sniffer dogs protect the huge numbers in Windsor today as part of the biggest security operation of recent times          One lucky bride, Vicky Compson, got to feel what it was like to be a princess for the day when she walked through the route Meghan and Harry will follow  to her own wedding today          Newlyweds Vicky and Aron Hallam then smiled after sharing a kiss during their reception at the Prince Harry pub in Windsor           Isabelle Sherlock and Charlie Twitchett, both ten, play Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for the day as they leave Fleetwood Methodist Church in Lancashire as  hundreds of primary school children staged their own version of the royal wedding today  Will Shepherd and Sienna Harrison, four-year-old cousins, played Harry and Meghan for the day at a nursery in Orrell, Wigan          School children wave flags on the Long Walk ahead of the wedding of the year tomorrow    Meghan and Harry will spend the evening apart this evening and the next time they will see each other again will be at the altar           Charles and Camilla were pictured leaving Kensington Palace by helicopter yesterday and this may have been when Meghan asked her future father-in-law if he would step in  This is how Meghan\u0027s entrance to St George\u0027s Chapel will unfold tomorrow and how Charles will meet her halfway          Kensington Palace has said that the Prince of Wales will accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St George\u0027s Chapel (pictured          Prince Charles said today he was \u0027pleased to welcome her to the royal family in this way\u0027, Kensington Palace revealed in a shock statement that also suggested Meghan could enter the church alone and meet Charles half way          Charles is said to be very fond of Meghan (pictured together on Christmas Day at Sandringham) and was happy to help her after her father caused a crisis ahead of her wedding            Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince Charles, but others have also said Meghan should have asked her mother Doria Meghan\u0027s mother Doria (pictured left in LA) was expected to give her daughter away.

They were also unable to say when Prince Harry would meet his new father-in-law. Although the couple have been dating for two years, the prince has only ever spoken to him by phone.Yesterday\u0027s announcement came at the end of a truly remarkable few days, in which Kensington Palace was accused of failing to get a grip of the situation, leaving Thomas Markle to brief the US gossip website TMZ about his plans.  Even Buckingham Palace courtiers have started looking at the website for the latest updates.  But as the final preparations were put into place yesterday afternoon, Miss Markle and Harry appeared to be all smiles.The couple attended their last wedding rehearsal at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, who are page boy and bridesmaid. Miss Markle looked radiant despite the strain of the past week, wearing a white £285 Boss bodysuit and £7,000 Birks diamond earrings.Although the Queen arrived at Windsor Castle for the weekend while the wedding party was there, she is understood not to have taken part.Friends said last night that despite the drama of the past few days, Miss Markle was excited about the wedding and looking forward to exchanging vows with her prince. One admitted that families could sometimes be \u0027messy\u0027, but that she and Harry knew they had done everything possible to support her parents.\u0027They are just looking forward to the next few days and happy and excited about becoming man and wife,\u0027 the source said.The Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aislePetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decisionRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleOprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsThe Prince of Wales is at Buckingham Palace today where he made author and broadcaster Melvyn Bragg,  a Companion of Honour as news emerged he will give Meghan away          Charlies gave away Alexandra Knatchbull, the daughter of his close friend, Lord Brabourne, in 2016.

A police boat cruises the Thames in Windsor today as part of the £30m operation to keep the event secure            Sniffer dogs are checking the streets while police are checking drains and removing bins to stop any attack on the royal wedding          The Quire in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Charles will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle tomorrowThe prince and Ms Markle\u0027s reception will be held in the castle\u0027s 180ft (55m) long St George\u0027s Hall, traditionally used for glittering state banquets.The vast hall had to be restored following the devastating fire at the castle in 1992.The chapel, with its intricately carved stonework, magnificent fan vaulted ceiling and beautiful stained glass windows, has seen many royal weddings and funerals.The last royal wedding was for Harry\u0027s cousin, Peter Phillips, son of the Princess Royal, who married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008.Harry\u0027s father and stepmother, the Duchess of Cornwall, had their televised religious blessing there in 2005, after their civil ceremony down the road in Windsor\u0027s Town Hall.In 1999, Harry\u0027s uncle, the Earl of Wessex, married Sophie Rhys-Jones, now the Countess of Wessex, at St George\u0027s.Royal newlyweds and their families traditionally pose for photographs afterwards on the vast west steps, as Harry and his new bride are certain to do.It has been the setting for many historic funerals including the Queen Mother\u0027s private committal service following her Westminster Abbey funeral in 2002, and in the same year, Princess Margaret\u0027s small, private funeral.The funeral of the Queen\u0027s father, King George VI, took place at St George\u0027s in 1952.Like Westminster Abbey, the chapel is known as a Royal Peculiar, with the Dean of Windsor responsible only to the sovereign.The church, a place of worship for the Queen and her family, is often at the heart of royal events, with the Windsors gathering there each year for Easter services, and in the past for occasions such as the service to mark the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s 90th birthday.Within the chapel are the tombs of 10 sovereigns - as well as George VI, the remains of Edward IV, Henry VI, Henry VIII and his third wife Jane Seymour, the beheaded Charles I, George III, George IV, William IV, Edward VII and George V also rest there.                           \u0027Prince Charles doesn\u0027t have a daughter so he must be VERY happy\u0027: Social media overflows with praise for Meghan\u0027s \u0027touching\u0027 decision to ask her father-in-law to give her away... although feminists claim the decision is \u0027sexist\u0027Royal fans today spoke of their joy for Prince Charles after it was revealed he will step in for the father of the bride and walk Meghan Markle down the aisle.The Prince of Wales will give his soon-to-be daughter-in-law away when she marries Prince Harry tomorrow at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle.Meghan, 36, asked her future father-in-law to accompany her on the way to the altar after her father Thomas Markle had to pull out following heart surgery.Responding to the announcement by Kensington Palace this morning, royal fans praised the \u0027fantastic\u0027 decision and said they were delighted for Charles.             Royal fans have mostly reacted positively to the news, speaking of their joy for Prince CharlesOne said: \u0027What a lovely thing. Charles himself has no biological daughters but he will definitely be gaining one tomorrow. It will be a very touching moment.\u0027Another from New South Wales, Australia, tweeted: \u0027What a wonderful blessing for them both. Something Charles thought he would never be able to do.\u0027Her mother may not have been comfortable doing this. Whatever the reason, it is fantastic. Many blessings and prayers for both Harry and Meghan.\u0027And a third said: \u0027I knew it would be Prince Charles. I was hoping for her mum to do it, but I guess she wanted to keep things as traditional as possible. Great choice!\u0027However, not everyone was happy with the announcement. Aimee Day tweeted: \u0027No, it should have been her mum to do it. She brought her up and she should do it.             Others are not so impressed by the decision, with some claiming it is a \u0027sexist\u0027 move\u0027In general I think the mother\u0027s should do it anyway. After all, in most situations the mother does everything for their child over the father - in my experience.\u0027And Rachel Douce added: \u0027Disappointing that Prince Charles is walking Meghan down the aisle. Perfect opportunity for the royals to show how modern and not sexist they are and let Doria do it, but no.\u0027Mr Markle was forced to pull out of performing the fatherly duty after undergoing heart surgery in a dramatic upset just two days before the wedding.The actress\u0027s mother Doria Ragland had been tipped to perform the role. But Harry\u0027s father is far more experienced at appearing at big public events amid scrutiny.Wedding-watchers camped outside Windsor Castle in readiness for the festivities said they felt her soon-to-be father-in-law stepping in was a \u0027nice gesture\u0027.The announcement from Kensington Palace on Friday morning came with just 24 hours to go until the big day, with final preparations well under way in Windsor. Windsor visitor Leslie Haynes, from Washington, said: \u0027I was surprised actually. I knew that Prince Charles was in the running. I just assumed it would be her mother.\u0027But it was Meghan\u0027s approval and choice and so we support that, and, as we say, the next King of England is going to walk her down the aisle.\u0027The 58-year-old, who is camping  opposite the castle, said she was \u0027somewhat\u0027 disappointed that Miss Ragland would not accompany Meghan to the altar.She added: \u0027But I have to say that it\u0027s her choice so we\u0027re happy for her. She is going to be the happiest woman in the world tomorrow so how could we be disappointed about that?\u0027Margaret Phipps, 25, from Texas, said: \u0027She has such a close relationship with her mum, so I think it is surprising to some people. But I think it\u0027s a nice gesture. \u0027He (Charles) doesn\u0027t have a daughter that he\u0027d ever be able to walk down the aisle. And it just sort of shows her transition into the royal family.\u0027She\u0027s really becoming a part of that family with him kind of acting as the father figure in situations, so I personally think it\u0027s nice.\u0027Sylvia Horn, 61, from Nashville, said it is \u0027wonderful\u0027, adding: \u0027It\u0027s usually a gentleman that does it.\u0027 \u0027I fully approve since Charles is going to be her father-in-law,\u0027 she said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/18/16/0BD397B600000578-5745449-image-a-58_1526657258571.jpg","title":"Royal Wedding dress code Prince Harry Meghan Markles big day revealed","story":"     Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seen here departing from Catalyst Inc, Northern Ireland\u0027s next generation science park  in Belfast, Nothern IrelandRoyal Wedding dress code for guestsDespite Meghan and Harry opting for a more low key affair, guests must remember that it is still a Royal Wedding and the invitations encourage men to wear military uniforms, morning coats or lounge suits and for women, a ‘day dress with hat’.Royal Wedding dress rulesEtiquette expert Myka Meier, who has trained in London under a former member of the royal household revealed that women should choose a dress that covers their shoulders, with a hemline no shorter than their longest finger, when their arms are at their side and no longer than mid-calf.‘You won’t see cleavage. You won’t see a lot of skin. At least you shouldn’t. It would be seen as disrespectful,’ Meier said. She continued to explain that dresses in black or white should not be worn, as white is for the bride and black is still associated with mourning.While light prints and patterns are welcome at a Spring wedding, big and block patterns are unacceptable but international guests will be permitted to wear their country’s equivalent.          Spain\u0027s Prince Felipe seen here flanked by Princess Letizia and Spain\u0027s Queen Sofia, outside of Westminster Abbey ahead of the wedding between Prince William and Kate MiddletonAccording to etiquette experts Debrett’s, Meghan Markle’s boundary-pushing style will allow for some leeway when it comes to traditional Royal Wedding protocol.It may be unusual to see women wearing trousers at a wedding, but Meghan’s own decision to wear a pantsuit at formal events may mean that covered legs could be welcomed on the big day, especially after jumpsuits were approved at Royal Ascot’s Royal Enclosure.Many invitees may also take a page out of Kate’s book and choose a piece by British labels such as Stella McCartney, Burberry, Emilia Wickstead, Erdem or even Marks and Spencer, as Meghan Markle has in the past.Will Royal Wedding guests be required to wear hats?Women often start with the hat when planning their outfits, as Meier explained and they are kept on during a wedding church service. ‘Hats are a sign of festivity for a British wedding. They are kept on inside the church, but people should be careful of the people sitting behind them. It\u0027s not the Kentucky Derby. No huge brims. Nothing too high.’Princess Beatrice’s hat at Prince William’s wedding was regarded ‘ridiculous in so many ways’ by Royal watcher Anne Chertoff.          Princess Beatrice seen here wearing the Philip Treacy hat she wore at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011When it comes to shoes, open toes, wedges and slingbacks are too informal. Meier said: ‘You want something that is about 4 inches maximum. \u0027The walk in is not going to be easy. There are lots of cobblestones even though there will be different types of carpeting.’In addition to this, handbags should be small as the seating in St. George’s Chapel is very tight, so clutches are recommended.What will men wear to the Royal Wedding?Those who have a military uniform are encouraged to wear it, but most men will opt for a morning suit in either grey, navy or black with coattails. Men will also be expected to wear a waistcoat and a regular tie.For lounge suits, the rule of thumb is the darker it is, the more formal it will look and that rules goes for morning suits too. In the same way, brown shoes are considered less formal than black ones.          Prince William and his wife Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, seen here coming out of Westminster Abbey in London, after their wedding service in 2011What will Meghan Markle wear?Despite the Royal Wedding dress designer being a closely-guarded secret, rumours have suggested that Ralph \u0026amp Russo is the British couturer that has been picked by Meghan Markle. The dress is expected to be a hand-stitched and heavily beaded gown with long sleeves.What will Prince Harry wear?Prince Harry will most likely wear his Household Cavalry British Army uniform and it has been rumoured that he will have to shave his beard because facial hair is frowned upon by the military circle, according to Elle.However, Harry may also go for a morning suit because the wedding is a much more low key affair than that of his brother, Prince William’s. Other rumours suggest that he will wear the Royal Marines ceremonial uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over from Prince Philip.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

Her father was a struggling department-store buyer. Wildenstein moved to Paris when she was a teenager.During that time she was in a relationship with the filmmaker Sergio Gobbi. Before her marriage to Alec, she was also linked to Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi and Cyril Piguet.In 1977, at the age of 31, Wildenstein met Alec on a safari trip to Kenya. Alec was there to kill a lion and Wildenstein asked to accompany him. The pair eloped the following year in Las Vegas.It was a tempestuous marriage. The couple reportedly spent $1 million a month on average and went for his-and-hers eye-lifts a year into their marriage. This marked the beginning of a long list of plastic surgeries.‘I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen,’ Alec Wildenstein told Vanity Fair.\u0027I don’t think I’ve known her when she wasn’t healing from something,\u0027 said a friend of Jocelyn in 1998. Wildenstein has frequently denied she’s had work done, saying in 1998 that her looks, which led to her being branded ‘Catwoman’, were natural.          In February 2018, the 77-year-old socialite said that she hasn\u0027t had any plastic surgery done‘If I show you pictures of my grandmother,’ she says, ‘what you see is these eyes—cat eyes—and high cheekbones.’ Wildenstein went on to deny she ever had any work done on her nose.After the couple’s children left home, Alec and Wildenstein ended up having ‘constant’ fights.One night, Wildenstein says she walked in on her husband with another woman and alleges he pointed a gun at her and her bodyguards—something Alec disputed, saying Wildenstein was downstairs when he saw the bodyguards.Alec spent the night in jail after the police were called.The pair’s orce was highly public and messy, with Alec slowly cutting Wildenstein’s financial means.Jocelyn Wildenstein before and after plastic surgeryJocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery a year after marrying her husband, in 1978. The pair went in for eye-lifts and the surgery was reportedly the first of many.However, in February 2018, Wildenstein and her now second husband, Lloyd Klein both denied she had any work done.\u0027I don\u0027t understand the whole press and the Catwoman thing because Jocelyn always looked like that,\u0027 Klein told DailyMailTV.Jocelyn Wildenstein reportedly had her first plastic surgery, an eye-lift, with Alec in 1978\u0027She never really did anything to change her face. I have pictures from 16 years old where she looks exactly the same as today.\u0027 However, in April 2018, Wildenstein admitted to having surgeries but stopping for a time during her orce from Alec.\u0027In the beginning, it\u0027s why I stopped correcting my appearance because the articles were mean and would repeat the image that my ex-husband tried to paint of me,\u0027 she told Paper Magazine. What is Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth?Jocelyn Wildenstein’s net worth is $16,386,100, according to her Chapter 11 bankruptcy documentation.This is a far cry from the $2.5 billion she was awarded during her orce from Alec Wildenstein. The filing lists that the socialite receives a $900 check a month from Social Security, which it says is her only source of income.Jocelyn Wildenstein bankruptcyJocelyn Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 2018, reportedly owing 16 creditors over $6 million. This includes hundreds of thousands of dollars to several building contractors, $70,000 to American Express, over $200,000 to two law firms, and $179,000 to Trump world Tower Condominium.Wildenstein also owes a staggering $4.6 million to Castellan Capital and $700,000 to a New York storage company.Dancing With The Stars finale: Date, time, finalists and moreThe French Open 2018: Roland Garros dates, schedule and tickets revealedBachelorette 2018: Chris Harrison reveals premiere will have \u0027most ridiculous fight ever\u0027Who was Stephanie Adams?

The chain has been looking at the idea for 10 years and, at one time, there were rumours of a partnership with Ocado, where the chairman is Lord Stuart Rose, who previously ran M\u0026ampSA source told the Grocer that the website changes could signal the start of a full rollout of an M\u0026ampS delivery service. The source said the lack of home food delivery was an \u0027obvious gap\u0027 and that shoppers consider such services a \u0027basic expectation\u0027.The source said: \u0027As M\u0026ampS\u0027 store numbers just aren\u0027t as high as other retailers, introducing this service could encourage more customers to shop at M\u0026ampS if it was made easier and more accessible for them.  \u0027It has quite a few hurdles to overcome to make this sustainable and economically viable, especially as shoppers don\u0027t tend to do full trolley shops at M\u0026ampS.\u0027 Another source said M\u0026ampS would be \u0027mad\u0027 to launch the service on the basis of the limited offer it currently has compared to mainstream supermarkets.

These could now be extendedThey warned: \u0027Their margins will go south given how expensive delivery services are to run.\u0027 The M\u0026ampS chief executive, Steve Rowe, has accepted the retailer cannot afford to ignore the growing online grocery market, estimated to be worth £17.6bn by 2021.He is reported to have said at one internal meeting: \u0027We continue to review food online carefully. It has not cost us anything over the last five years by not being online with food. Our customers haven\u0027t moved yet, but they will and we need to ensure we are ready with the right response.\u0027 M\u0026ampS denied it was preparing to roll out a complete grocery delivery service."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/14/4C6C3FD900000578-5747471-Pro_government_media_outlets_splashed_their_photos_online_and_in-m-30_1526736304769.jpg","title":"Detained Saudi women driving campaigners branded traitors","story":" Aziza al-Yousef drives a car on a highway in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, as part of a campaign to defy Saudi Arabia\u0027s ban on women driving. She and six other activists have been arrestedThe activists had persistently called for the right for women to drive, with the ban to be lifted in just six weeks.However, they stressed that this was only the first step toward full rights and for year also called for an end to less visible forms of discrimination.They campaigned for lifting guardianship laws that give male relatives final say on whether a woman can travel abroad, obtain a passport, or marry.Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal.All major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Some state-linked media outlets published the names of those detained, which include Loujain al-Hathloul, Aziza al-Yousef and Eman al-Najfan.          Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights. Several of the women were professors at state-run universities and are mothers or grandmothers.The Interior Ministry on Saturday did not name those arrested, but said the group is being investigated for communicating with \u0027foreign entities\u0027. It said they were working to recruit people in sensitive government positions and giving money to foreign circles aiming to destabilise and harm the kingdom.The stunning arrests come just six weeks before Saudi Arabia is set to lift the world\u0027s only ban on women driving next month.Saudi police save three women from rapists - then arrest...Millions of Muslims around the world prepare for...Share this articleWhen the kingdom issued its royal decree last year announcing that women would be allowed to drive in 2018, women\u0027s rights activists were contacted by the royal court and warned against giving interviews to the media or speaking out on social media.Following the warnings, some women left the country for a period of time and others stopped voicing their opinions on Twitter.As activists were pressured into silence, Saudi Arabia\u0027s 32-year-old heir to the throne stepped forth, positioning himself as the force behind the kingdom\u0027s reforms.However, Human Rights Watch said the crown prince\u0027s so-called reform campaign \u0027has been a frenzy of fear for genuine Saudi reformers who dare to advocate publicly for human rights or women\u0027s empowerment\u0027.\u0027The message is clear that anyone expressing skepticism about the crown prince\u0027s rights agenda faces time in jail,\u0027 Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, said  Loujain al-Hathloul was another of the seven activists branded \u0027traitors\u0027 who were working for \u0027foreign entities\u0027Last year, Prince Mohammed oversaw the arrests of dozens of writers, intellectuals and moderate clerics who were perceived as critics of his foreign policies. He also led an unprecedented shakedown of top princes and businessmen, forcing them to hand over significant portions of their wealth in exchange for their freedom as part of a purported anti-corruption campaign.In an interview with CBS in March, he said that he was \u0027absolutely\u0027 sending a message through these arrests that there was a new sheriff in town.Activists said writer Mohammed al-Rabea and lawyer Ibrahim al-Mudaimigh, two men who worked to support women\u0027s rights campaigners, are also among the seven detained. Al-Mudaimigh defended al-Hathloul in court when she was arrested in late 2014 for more than 70 days for her online criticism of the government and for attempting to bring attention to the driving ban by driving from neighboring United Arab Emirates into Saudi Arabia.Those familiar with the arrests said al-Hathloul was forcibly taken by security forces earlier this year from the UAE, where she was residing, and forced back to the kingdom.In recent weeks, activists said several women\u0027s rights campaigners were also banned from traveling abroad.  Their movement was seen as part of a larger democratic and civil rights push in the kingdom, which remains an absolute monarchy where protests are illegal and major decision-making rests with the king and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (pictured)Immediately after news of the arrests broke, pro-government Twitter accounts were branding the group as treasonous under an Arabic hashtag describing them as traitors for foreign embassies.The pro-government SaudiNews50 Twitter account, with its 11.5 million followers, splashed images of those arrested with red stamps over their face that read \u0027traitor\u0027 and saying that \u0027history spits in the face of the country\u0027s traitors.\u0027The state-linked Al-Jazirah newspaper published on its front-page a photo of al-Hathloul and al-Yousef under a headline describing them as citizens who betrayed the nation.Activists said some in the group were arrested on Tuesday and at least one person was arrested Thursday.They said the detainees were transferred from the capital, Riyadh, to the city of Jiddah for interrogations where the royal court has relocated for the month of Ramadan.Activists said it wasn\u0027t not clear why the seven were arrested now."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/13/4C6E005B00000578-5747477-image-a-332_1526732894449.jpg","title":"En route Prince Harry leaves Coworth Park hotel royal Wedding","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

I don\u0027t think being that it\u0027s her second wedding dress has anything to do with it.\u0027I think this is the one that counts. This is the one that matters,\u0027 he said.  He added that their father, who has had his own share of embarrassment this week after it was revealed he had staged paparazzi photographs and taken money for it, backed out of the wedding at the last minute.           Also not there was the bride\u0027s father Thomas Markle Sr. who embarrassed himself this week by staging paparazzi photographs and taking a sum for it. He suffered a heart attack and said that was the reason he would not attend           Doria Ragland, Meghan\u0027s mother, was the only member of her family who was seen. She beamed with pride throughout her drive to the chapel with her daughter and during the emotional ceremony Thomas Markle Sr. said a recent heart attack, which he suffered days before he was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, kept him from the event.Markle Sr. said his father was happy Prince Charles stood in to accompany Meghan for some of her long walk down St. George\u0027s Chapel. \u0027I think my dad would be sad that he can\u0027t be here but if there was a choice he would be overjoyed Prince Charles is there,\u0027 he said. Markle Jr. added that he was sure Meghan and Harry would be eager to start their own family soon and painted her as a maternal figure who had long doted on his children.           Meghan, 36, is pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel on Saturday during her wedding to Prince Harry.

Kate\u0027s 1936 diamond \u0027Halo\u0027 tiara by Cartier was her \u0027something borrowed\u0027, on loan from the QueenBoth gowns shared a high-waisted, full-skirted silhouette with a long, dramatic train, and were worn with the sheerest of veils and diamond tiaras.However Kate\u0027s vintage headwear was from an era that preceded Princess Grace\u0027s marriage - the 1936 diamond \u0027Halo\u0027 tiara by Cartier was her \u0027something borrowed\u0027, on loan from the Queen.The comparison reveals how very classic Kate\u0027s style is, and how timeless Princess Grace\u0027s bridal look was. Princess Diana            The details of Princess Diana\u0027s dress managed to be kept a complete mystery until hours before her wedding to Charles, Prince of Wales, at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral  Diana chats to five-year-old bridesmaid Clementine Hambro under the watchful eye of the Queen (left) and travelling from Clarence House to St Paul\u0027s in the royal carriage (right)Harry and William\u0027s mother Princess Diana wore a huge puffy gown designed by the Emanuel\u0027s when she married Prince Charles in 1981. Her dress was known as at the time as the \u0027most closely guarded secret in fashion history.\u0027The meringue style gown, which was worth £9,000 in 1981 is approximately equivalent to £36,800 today. Details of the future princess\u0027s dress managed to be kept a complete mystery until hours before her wedding to Charles, Prince of Wales,  at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral.And the grand unveiling of the gown, which back in 1981 cost £9,000, did not disappoint.Designed by husband-and-wife duo David and Elizabeth Emanuel, the intricate ivory taffeta gown later saw copycat creations made around the world.

The Duchesse ivory silk-satin creation took royal couturier Sir Norman and his team three months to finishWith a heart-shaped neckline with scalloped edge, the gown was decorated with 10,000 seed pearls, glittering crystals and featured an intricate 13ft star-patterned train. Embroidered with roses, star-shaped flowers and wheat in pearl, crystal and appliques of transparent tulle, its floral design was seen as a symbol of growth and regeneration after the hardships of the Second World War. On the day of the wedding at Westminster Cathedral, the seamstresses who worked tirelessly on the gown were given a prime spot outside Buckingham Palace as a reward.  The Queen, like all British brides in the post-war days, was given 200 extra clothing coupons from the Government towards her wedding trousseau.Women across the UK, keen to ensure Princess Elizabeth would have the dress of her dreams, sent their own coupons to the young royal to help out.But it was illegal to give coupons away and the gifts had to be returned.  However, The Crown gave a good idea of how much the dress might cost to make today as designers for the BBC programme created an identical gown for the wedding scene, which cost £30,000.

So I feel personally invested in this romance!)The large crowd whooped ecstatically with each celebrity sighting and the stars waved with as much faux regalness as they could muster.But as I watched, my mind kept going back to one uneasy question: how can you justify having NONE of your family at your own marriage when you’re filling the church with famous people whom you’ve known for a fraction of the time?It smacked of ruthless and rather distasteful social climbing by a woman who was absolutely delightful when we met in my pub, but whose life has been marked by a worrying tendency to ditch people when they cease to be of use to her. (Her first husband thought they had a happy marriage until the day that Meghan sent his rings back in the post.)          Piers Morgan has given his verdict on the ultimate showbiz weddingMy hackles were raised further when some of the actors strode to the front of the church quire, nestling opposite senior Royals in a clear thespian statement of intent from Ms Markle that screamed: ‘We’re just as big stars as you stuffy lot in tiaras.’They are not, of course. There are no bigger stars than the British Royals, no other human beings who can command 5,000 media people to their weddings, or a billion television viewers.But there’s no doubt Hollywood hijacked this Royal Wedding, both in personnel and in tone, in a carefully co-ordinated operation by an actress putting on the performance of her life, to celebrate the greatest day of her life.Meghan played it safe with her choice of elegant, stylish dress. For her choice of speaker, she played with fire. Literally.The Most Reverend Michael Curry let rip with surely the most memorable Royal Wedding speech ever heard. A sensational tour de force that cited slaves, quoted Dr Martin Luther King, and spoke repeatedly of the raging power of fire and love.At first, I was startled. What the hell was happening here? Then, I was amused. Was he ever going to stop? The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/22/4C7384D100000578-0-image-a-4_1526765077031.jpg","title":"Oprah Winfrey arrives royal wedding mystery man Stella McCartney dress overnight","story":"    Who dat?: Oprah Winfrey arrived to the royal wedding without Stedman Graham and instead with a mystery man, entering behind Idris Elba          It\u0027s been real: She and the man did part ways however when Oprah went to find her much better seat in St George\u0027s Chapel      Think pink like Oprah in a Stella McCartney midi dressShop the current line here!Achieving best-dressed guest status is no easy feat when you\u0026#39re attending the most anticipated wedding of the year, but we think Oprah Winfrey might be a strong contender for the title!The talk show host donned a custom Stella McCartney midi dress for Harry and Meghan\u0026#39s big day, topping off her look with a bespoke Philip Treacy concertina lace hat with a feather plume.

She said that of those who have taken the exam this year, only four children have since indicated they will move closer to be eligible for a place. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/23/4C73E34700000578-5749117-There_was_something_of_a_carnival_atmosphere_in_the_gardens_of_t-a-10_1526769544644.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan enjoy wedding party naughty speeches Princes pals","story":"    There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertainingIn fact, their dinner party had more in common with a West End club night than a traditional wedding breakfast, with Harry’s favourite House tracks ‘curated’ by DJ Sam Totolee (who also performed at Pippa Middleton’s wedding), a ‘drinks of the world’ themed bar, and candyfloss and ‘dirty burgers’ as midnight snacks.One source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was put on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry’s red hair. It was named ‘When Harry Met Meghan’, a play on the film When Harry Met Sally.The party was a notably relaxed, more youthful occasion than the afternoon reception.The intimate guestlist of 200 meant there was no room for mere acquaintances, nor even many minor Royals. Pippa Middleton and Harry’s party-girl ex Chelsy Davy were expected to be absentees.There was something of a carnival atmosphere in the gardens of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to King George III. These days it is used mainly for entertaining.The sit-down dinner was strictly organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed ‘spring meets summer’. The meal, paid for by the Prince of Wales, started at 7.30pm and finished at around 10pm.Its three courses were understood to have been peppered with ‘naughty’ speeches from Prince William and a joint effort from Tom Inskip, known as ‘Skippy’ and Tom Van Straubenzee. Any crude nods to Prince Harry’s playboy past were held back until the older guests had departed.Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027          The revamped classic car\u0027s number plate read \u0027E190518\u0027 - a tribute to the newlywed\u0027s wedding date.

Another party had been planned in a soundproofed private home in Chelsea.It was quite a contrast with the earlier ‘stand-up’ wedding breakfast in Windsor Castle’s St George’s Hall, which saw 600 guests enjoy ‘bowl food’ and canapes such as Scottish langoustines wrapped in smoked salmon, croquette of confit Windsor Lamb and champagne and pistachio macarons. Harry and his father then gave speeches. Suhani Jalota, the founder of the India-based Myna Mahila charity, said of Harry’s speech: ‘He was talking about his wife. Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.’She described a speech by the Prince of Wales as ‘lovely’, adding: ‘Essentially it was just about how Harry was as a child and growing up. And about the couple and how beautiful they are together.’Another guest said: ‘Charles nailed it in his speech. He talked about Harry being a baby needing bottles and diapers, then said: “Look how well he turned out.” ’    Guests are also understood to have returned to London late last night for an ‘after-after party’ at celebrity favourite Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone.

It became like a mini-concert in the reception area,’ said one guest. ‘Some people were even crying.’The reception included the cutting of the lemon and elderflower-flavoured wedding cake. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/23/4C7149E300000578-0-STYLE_REPLAY_The_brides_both_wore_ivory_while_William_and_Harry_-a-94_1526769439368.jpg","title":"Anything Kate Meghan Two familiar different Royal Weddings","story":"    STYLE REPLAY: The brides both wore ivory while William and Harry opted for dress uniformThe Only Way Is Sussex!

Harry and Meghan had already spoken in their engagement interview of their passion for the Commonwealth and their hopes for engaging with its young people.          Telling aides that they want to ‘hit the ground running’, Harry and Meghan will instead join the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall at his 70th Birthday Patronage Celebration in the gardens of Buckingham Palace on TuesdayIt is hoped the pair will join Charles and Camilla and William and Kate in helping to exercise ‘soft power’ diplomacy.Meghan has already seen a great deal since her engagement to Harry. Within a few months, the couple had visited every country in the United Kingdom and she appeared to take it all in her stride. Displaying characteristic confidence, she would often introduce herself without waiting for Harry to show her the way.Meghan will be 37 on August 4, so it is likely that starting a family will be a priority. It is something they would both like.Three years ago, after I revealed Harry was quitting the Army, I asked the Prince: ‘What are you going to do next?’ ‘You’ll probably know before me,’ he joked. But he soon became reflective, saying that he wanted to use his celebrity for the good of others.We spoke about his plans to focus on his charity work and a desire to spend ‘a significant period abroad’ on field projects in Africa, which he later did. But mostly he was driven to give back, especially to former military colleagues, as well as to continue his mother’s legacy in helping to eradicate AIDS.

The USGS’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said eruptions that create even minor amounts of ashfall could occur at any time. The new lava, which is flowing east underground from the sinking lava lake at Kilauea’s summit, is expected to create bigger flows that travel further, threatening homes and a coastal road that is a key exit route for about 2,000 residents.Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days.\u0027We have no way of knowing whether this is really the beginning or toward the end of this eruption,\u0027 Tom Shea, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii told Associated Press on Friday.\u0027We\u0027re kind of all right now in this world of uncertainty.\u0027  Oprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aislePetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decision    New lava forming at the summit of Kilauea is expected to spread further and come out faster, which could threaten the homes of 2,000 people and close off key exit routes          Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days          With the intensity of Kilauea\u0027s eruption increasing, officials are warning residents to heed evacuation warnings          As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the airOprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aislePetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decision"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/00/4C740D8B00000578-0-image-a-31_1526771443014.jpg","title":"Apologise calling Andrea Leadsom stupid woman female MPs tell Speaker John Bercow","story":"    John Bercow faces a pincer movement from female MPs who are demanding he apologise over his alleged ‘stupid woman’ jibe at a senior Tory MinisterAnd last night, senior Labour MP Kate Hoey and Tory Vicky Ford both called on the Speaker to apologise.Ms Hoey, a former Labour Minister, contrasted Mr Bercow’s behaviour with that of Betty Boothroyd, the only woman who has so far been Speaker.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/19/01/4C6A304B00000578-0-image-m-191_1526690224906.jpg","title":"Ocado chief pocket record 110m bonuses","story":"Share this articleSteiner arriving at the High Court in London with lawyer Fiona Shackleton (pictured left) for the settlement hearing in his orce hearing with wife Belinda Steiner (right picture)Ocado has racked up large losses over the years, and reported its first pre-tax profit only in 2015.

Pro-government media outlets splashed their photos online and in newspapers, accusing them of betrayal for their supposed crimesRights activists said Madeha al-Ajroush and Aisha al-Manae are also among the seven detained. Both took part in the first women\u0027s protest movement for the right to drive in 1990, in which 50 women were arrested for driving and lost their passports and their jobs.All five women are well-known activists who agitated for greater women\u0027s rights.

The cameras cut to a giggling William, Charles and Camilla, to a stern-faced Queen and Philip, and then to a completely baffled Sir Elton John.As Bishop Curry roused himself to ever-higher decibels, I found myself laughing out loud, as were all my family watching with me at home.Eventually, he finished, and my phone rang. It was my 17-year-old son Bertie, who was at school.‘Dad, did you see that?’ he exclaimed excitedly.‘Yes, hilarious wasn’t it…’  US chat show host Oprah Winfrey waved to cameras as she arrived, and Mumford \u0026amp Sons singer Marcus Mumford and actress wife Carey Mulligan arrived together          Sir Elton John, pictured, wore a pair of ominous rose-tinted spectacles at the wedding. Morgan says: \u0027I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere\u0027‘No! It was incredible!’ he replied. ‘Can you imagine what this must mean to a black American – seeing a black preacher make that kind of speech at a traditionally white British Royal Wedding? This was history happening right before our eyes. I love this wedding!’His youthful passion and excitement shamed my middle-aged cynicism. Bertie was right.Bishop Curry sent us all to church yesterday and reminded us that at its core this wedding was about race too: a biracial woman from America marrying into the world’s most famous white family.When he finally sat down, the cameras panned to the bride’s mother Doria, sitting alone, diamond nose stud glinting, tears rolling from her eyes.It was very obvious just what the speech meant to her.He was followed by a black gospel choir singing a brilliant version of Stand By Me and 19-year-old black musical genius Sheku Kanneh-Mason playing the cello so beautifully.I would think it’s hard to overstate the significance of the ceremony, beamed live around the world, to black people everywhere. To borrow the words of Dr King, this was a day when little black girls could watch TV and genuinely share little white girls’ long-held dreams of one day marrying a Prince.(And yes, before the tiresome radical feminists start raging, I know not all girls want to be princesses, and I know not all girls now identify as girls…)In the end, though, this was like the greatest Oscars ceremony of all time: just one hour long, with tub-thumpingly brilliant off-piste speeches, musical performances to melt the heart, comedy moments to make you cry with laughter, and raw emotion to just make you cry.I loved seeing Prince Philip, 96, march into the church without a stick just weeks after a hip operation. (Perhaps he should send Thomas Markle a guidebook on how to man-up for important family events?)I loved seeing Prince Charles chivalrously take Meghan’s arm halfway down the aisle and focus so intently on his brief but vital job in delivering her safely to his son.And I loved the bridesmaids and pageboys all desperately trying not to behave too badly and succeeding remarkably well.I also loved the fact that, in direct contrast to most awards ceremonies, the biggest winners were two superstars who the public clearly adore.  Actor Idris Elba arrived with his model fiancée Sabrina Dhowre, both wearing navy blue, and James Corden looked sharp alongside his elegant wife Julia CareyMeghan looked radiantly beautiful, supremely confident, and born to play the role of a princess, even if in fact she’s going to be the Duchess of Sussex, the county where I grew up.Harry looked madly in love, endearingly nervous (His ‘I’m ******** it!’ confession to his bride at the altar spoke for every man at every wedding ever) and carrying the weight of the world’s hopes on his shoulders.We all want this charming, sensitive young man to be happy. Not least because we all remember him trudging so sadly behind the coffin of his mother, Diana.Of course, we have no idea if this marriage will last.The recent matrimonial record of Royal couples is inarguably dreadful and palace life remains such a suffocating force for even the brightest of those, like Meghan and Diana before her, who enter its confines.So, we’ll just have to sit back and hope for the best.But what I do know is that their marriage ceremony was the most enjoyable and unpredictable Royal Wedding I’ve ever experienced.It mixed the best of traditional British pomp and majesty with large dollops of Markle Sparkle and the result was a biracial, Hollywood-fused union of very different cultures that worked magnificently well.As my Good Morning Britain co-presenter Susanna Reid, who only last week reaffirmed to me her lifelong phobia of all things marital, tweeted afterwards: ‘I may have just been converted to weddings.’Since I’m a orcee, I prefer not to give advice to newlyweds. But I can proffer one piece of uncontestable wisdom that is very easy to adopt.Meghan apparently insisted on lots of geraniums at her wedding. They’re one of her favourite flowers. By coincidence, my family motto is based on something that a Covent Garden flower seller once said to my grandmother: ‘Life ain’t much, but it’s all ya got, so stick a geranium in yer ’at and be ’appy.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/05/4C72F5B900000578-5749333-Hawaii_s_Kilauea_volcano_has_been_erupting_for_more_than_two_wee-a-167_1526789404091.jpg","title":"Fresh lava Hawaiis Kilauea volcano consumes four homes begins travel faster","story":"    Pictured: Flames surround what remains of a home in Pahoa (left) after it was covered in lava, as the stream rushes towards another home          Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, with locals subject to the sounds of near-constant explosions    Multiple fissures are actively spurting and fountaining out lava, which is moving faster now the older magma has been clearedThe volcano has been erupting for more than two weeks now, and has coated more than 325 hectares of Leilani Estates and Lanipuna Gardens  in lava.More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from residential areas on Big Island and National Guard helicopters have been sent out to airlift at least four residents from Hawaii\u0027s lower Puna area. As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the air.Hawaii resident, 75, snaps incredible photos of volcano...Photographer behind iconic Hawaii photo of golfers playing...Fountains of lava spewing 200ft HIGH and bombs the size of...Share this articleThree people were initially trapped on Saturday, but eventually got out of a hazardous area, and one was evacuated by air, said Janet Snyder, spokeswoman for Hawaii County.\u0027They shouldn\u0027t be in that area,\u0027 said County Managing Director Wil Okabe.

The USGS’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said eruptions that create even minor amounts of ashfall could occur at any time. The new lava, which is flowing east underground from the sinking lava lake at Kilauea’s summit, is expected to create bigger flows that travel further, threatening homes and a coastal road that is a key exit route for about 2,000 residents.Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days.\u0027We have no way of knowing whether this is really the beginning or toward the end of this eruption,\u0027 Tom Shea, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii told Associated Press on Friday.\u0027We\u0027re kind of all right now in this world of uncertainty.\u0027  Oprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aislePetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decision    New lava forming at the summit of Kilauea is expected to spread further and come out faster, which could threaten the homes of 2,000 people and close off key exit routes          Scientists are so far unable to predict when the volcano will quiet, but a similar event in 1955 lasted 88 days          With the intensity of Kilauea\u0027s eruption increasing, officials are warning residents to heed evacuation warnings          As of Friday, Hawaii County officials had distributed about 2,000 N95 gas masks to help protect locals from high levels of sulphur dioxide and ash in the airOprah thanks Stella McCartney for royal wedding dress after \u0027colour gate\u0027Prince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionBarry Gardiner confronted with audio of him rubbishing Labour testsRoyal fans camp in Windsor street the night before weddingMeghan Markle asks Prince Charles to walk her down the aisleThe Prince of Wales will walk Meghan Markle down the aislePetting farm owner attacked by travellers on her own land\u0027People will be disappointed\u0027: Robert Lacey on Prince Charles decision"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/00/4C740D8B00000578-0-image-a-31_1526771443014.jpg","title":"Apologise calling Andrea Leadsom stupid woman female MPs tell Speaker John Bercow","story":"    John Bercow faces a pincer movement from female MPs who are demanding he apologise over his alleged ‘stupid woman’ jibe at a senior Tory MinisterAnd last night, senior Labour MP Kate Hoey and Tory Vicky Ford both called on the Speaker to apologise.Ms Hoey, a former Labour Minister, contrasted Mr Bercow’s behaviour with that of Betty Boothroyd, the only woman who has so far been Speaker.

It has long seemed so practical, so sensible and at the same time inspiringly progressive that the benefits that Henry Ford discovered in the production line – speed, efficiency, cheapness, quality – might be applied to the places where we live. Le Corbusier had a go in the 1920s. So did Buckminster Fuller, with the aluminium yurt he called the Dymaxion.Somehow, their machine-age nirvana keeps on not quite happening. The world is not covered with Dymaxia, nor the many other variations on the theme. The nearest Britain came to living the dream was with the postwar prefab – quick and cheap, for sure, but rationed in their comfort and beauty, modern nostalgic revisionism notwithstanding. In the 1960s, government promotion of factory-built housing tended to produce results that were not particularly cheap, or functional, or good-looking, but were at least numerous.Still, nil desperandum. Since the 1980s, office buildings have been built with extensive prefabrication, or modularisation, to use the preferred contemporary name – facade panels and toilet blocks built under cover, away from the wind, rain, muck and hazards of a building site, and craned into place with the satisfying simplicity of a child’s toy. If Britain’s housing shortages are seriously to be addressed, they will require not only land and funding, but also an expansion of the construction industry’s capacity to build. Which, if it is not to entail limitless supplies of labour coming to Brexit Britain from eastern Europe, will require the aid of factories.As in the 1960s, politicians are urging. Last year the London Assembly published a report arguing that off-site manufacturing (as they called it) would be essential to meeting London’s need for at least 50,000 new homes a year. And, possibly, there are at last signs that this holy grail of housing (or the philosopher’s stone, or Fermat’s last theorem, or theory of everything – take your pick among things and solutions that are legendarily hard to find) might be found.Among the reasons to be hopeful is Mapleton Cresent in Wandsworth, south London, a just-finishing 27-storey development wrapped in aqueous green-grey faience. Billed as “Europe’s tallest modular residential tower”, it is designed by the architects politan Workshop for the developer Pocket Living, who specialise in reducing the cost of housing by producing flats that are small but, they hope, perfectly formed. They aim to compensate for the reduced dimensions of their units through careful design and by adding such shared benefits as a roof terrace, cycle storage and a residents’ lounge.The tower stands on an awkward little site, in spirit part poetic and part functional. One side is the uncompromising flank of the Southside shopping centre, on another the fast-flowing river Wandle, one of those secondary London rivers that are sometimes mentioned and rarely seen. It’s an unlikely spot for a tall building, even in a city where they can now sprout almost anywhere, but with the help of modularisation the developers and architects found a way to do it.Mapleton Crescent is made up of storey-high units, each the size of half a flat, that arrived on site complete with plaster, paint, windows, doors, wiring, plumbing, bathrooms and tiles, and were then craned into place, one on the top of each other, at the rate of one storey per day. These boxes are structural too, meaning that they hold each other up without the need of an additional frame. The factory-made units, built in Bedfordshire by the contractor Donban, saved time – which, as developers like Pocket borrow to build, is money. By going up almost as soon as they arrive, they reduce the problems that come with a small site, which is that builders have nowhere to keep materials that are waiting to be erected.Where Mapleton Crescent differs from past visions of factory-made housing is that it feels no need to proclaim its futurism – indeed it’s all the better for making its mechanical DNA feel both domestic and urban. Early prophets such as Buckminster Fuller thought that a home built like a car should look like a car. Here the flats are of a type basically familiar from conventionally built homes. The exterior faience cladding, its precise shade developed by the ceramic artist Loraine Rutt, is itself a factory-made modular material, but one that has been commonplace on London buildings since the 19th century.The building has architectural qualities that are nothing in particular to do with the innovation in its construction. It has a pleasantly slender profile, with shifting rhythms and a nice balance of verticals and horizontals. There is a considered relationship to the river, and an entrance hall that, by bringing the external materials inside, has a durable and well-made feel. The textured surfaces of the faience give a sense of depth and liveliness you don’t get in most cladding systems. Mapleton Crescent is – and never mind that the bar is low – one of the best-looking examples to come out of London’s boom in residential towers.It is plausible because it doesn’t proselytise. Modular units are used not as prophecy but as the best available means in a given circumstance. It must be said that this project is singular. The cost and complexity of building a tower on this site means that Pocket have included 36 homes at full market price (£600,000-£730,000 for two- and three-bedroom flats) to subsidise its 53 cheaper units (at £225,000-£330,000 for a petite, 38 sq metres one-bed – cheapness in London being a strictly relative concept). The same techniques, however, are now being applied to other tall building projects, with a better proportion of affordability.Mapleton Crescent is not alone. The financial services company Legal \u0026amp General promise to “revolutionise” housing by investing in factory-built houses, the exact nature of which remains to be revealed. The developers Urban Splash have tried their hand at it in their New Islington development in Manchester. Some of the big housebuilding companies are also having a go.There is formidable inertia to be overcome. Most homes are realised by the big housebuilders, who have well-established ways of building involving fleets of sub-contractors, all of which would have to be reinvented to accommodate modular building. It also requires investment in factories and production lines, which require confidence that future demand will be at least steady, which in the booming-and-busting British housing market is hard to find.Building in factories is not a magic bullet. It will not solve the housing crisis, so long as bigger questions such as the supply of land and public investment remain unresolved. But it’s an eminently sane and beneficial way of constructing homes, with less waste and better quality, whose time might finally be coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ae1aa8451ce91195d539224e6fa3e099fad28/4_4_2507_1503/master/2507.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99c4595704d24f8971dc40a8df80aa05","title":"lady in blue the nudes of lisa brice in pictures","story":"South Africa-born artist Lisa Brice first began working on her series of blue female nudes in 2014. “The situations are imagined,” she says, “but based on real experience.” They’ve been all-consuming at times: “I painted a group of 60 continuously day and night for a month,” she says. “Eventually they grew into a small army of feminine figures.”Brice, who now lives in London after spells in Trinidad, partly chose the colour because of its associations, “from the glow of blue neon signs to the fleeting colour of twilight, to the Trinidadian ‘blue devil’ carnival character”.

Here, he talks about the book’s debt to film, and to his own paranoia• Read a two-page extract from Nick Drnaso’s SabrinaWhere is Sabrina? Nick Drnaso’s second graphic novel begins as a mystery: a woman is missing, and no one is able to find her. Pretty soon, though, it becomes clear that his interest doesn’t lie so much with Sabrina’s fate as with the impact her death will have on those close to her: in particular, on Sandra, her sister, and on Teddy, her boyfriend. What happens, Drnaso wants to know, when the victim of a highly publicised violent crime is someone you love?Teddy, all at sea, moves west to stay with a guy he knew in childhood, Calvin Wrobel, a serviceman, newly separated from his wife and child, who works nights at a Colorado air force base, and in this almost-a-friend’s spare bedroom, settles into a prolonged depression. The two men find that they cannot talk to each other. After work, Wrobel retires to bed where he scans social media on his laptop Teddy spends his days listening to Albert Douglas, a radio host who has built a following by claiming that most acts of terrorism are staged by a government eager to strip the American people of their freedom. Sandra finds it easier to talk to strangers at a public storytelling event than to her closest girlfriend.Sabrina, which has already drawn extraordinary advance praise – Zadie Smith describes it as a masterpiece that combines all the political power of a polemic with the “delicacy of truly great art” – could not be more prescient if it tried. Its narrative touches with perfect ease on such contemporary matters as fake news, the isolation of the digital age, conspiracy theories and gun control (subjects that many traditional novelists seem determined to avoid). “Actually, though, I set it in the near future purely for boring, functional reasons,” says Drnaso, a winner of the new talent prize at this year’s Angoulême international comics festival, who lives in Chicago and is\u0026nbspnot yet 30. “I didn’t consider at all what that near future might look\u0026nbsplike.”At the time, he was suffering from anxiety and paranoid nightmares, conditions that influenced its tense, mistrustful tone far more than the contents of the newspapers. “I thought I could use the story to work those things through,” he says – and so, just like Teddy, he headed west to stay with a childhood friend in the military (there, he took the photographs that would inform his strips). Did this do the trick? No. “When I finished it, I flipped into a major depression. I thought: this is a Pandora’s box I never should have opened. I believed I was paying some kind of psychic price for it.”Reading Sabrina is an experience akin to watching a movie. It’s as if the lights have gone down: absorbed and gripped, the skin prickles. So perhaps it’s no surprise to hear Drnaso say that he came to comics only in adulthood that though he loves Chris Ware, who also lives in Chicago, and who has given him a lot of support down the years, his book is more influenced by TV and film than by other cartoonists: “I once had the thought that in the 60s, there were lots of people who tried to be film directors, but who didn’t have the extrovert temperament for it, and that these people are the great, lost cartoonists. But graphic novels weren’t even an option then.” He hesitates. “What I love about drawing them is that I can work in private.”Such privacy brings him peace of mind, but it also lends his book some of its power, its moral force. We put so much stuff out there about ourselves, and yet we struggle even to meet the eye of those we encounter every day. His book asks the question: how did we let this happen? And: when will we come to understand what it is doing to us?• Sabrina by Nick Drnaso is published on 7 June by Granta (£16.99). To order a copy for £14.44 go to bookshop or call 0330 333 6846.

It has already closed 20, affecting about 900 jobs, but staff are braced for the axe to fall on another tranche of stores before the announcement of its annual results on Wednesday.The closures are part of a plan announced 18 months ago to slash the amount of shopfloor space devoted to its ailing clothing ranges. Initially, just 30 out of a group of 105 underperforming stores were to shut but Rowe has decided on a more aggressive closure plan as sales move online.After several years of disappointing financial results, the restructuring at M\u0026ampS has entered a more radical phase since Archie Norman was installed as chairman. There have been a number of casualties in the boardroom including Andy Adcock, the boss of its upmarket food halls, who has been replaced, and marketing chief Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne.When the company updated investors six months ago, Norman was frank about the scale of its problems. M\u0026ampS had been “drifting” for more than 15 years, he said, as he promised to speed up store changes and tackle its misfiring food business.Rowe has been in charge for two years but, with no green shoots to celebrate and a backdrop of weak consumer spending, M\u0026ampS’s share price has fallen by nearly a quarter over the past year. The decline means the 134-year-old retailer’s place in the prestigious FTSE 100 could now be in jeopardy. M\u0026ampS has been a member of the blue chip index since its inception in 1984 but could be relegated to the FTSE 250 in a stock exchange reshuffle this week. Relegation would be a symbolic moment for the British institution that has struggled to hang on to shoppers in a digital age.Ocado, the online grocer, and Asos, the fashion website, are now worth more than M\u0026ampS in market value terms in a sign of the sea change in shopping habits. Ocado surged past M\u0026ampS on Thursday after it struck a major deal with US supermarket chain Kroger.Rowe will flag price cuts this week in the food and clothing aisles as M\u0026ampS attempts to fight back against the growth of value chains such as Primark, Aldi and Lidl. He will also announce investment in the warehousing needed to support the growth of its website.Shore Capital analyst Clive Black predicted an improving trend in clothing sales but felt that the food business had fared less well. “It’s the perpetual conundrum of M\u0026ampS,” he said. “Can it get the stars aligned and both businesses growing at the same time? Not yet.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afbc0053e8755e0e36c28f510c44764f7af5d382/0_289_4426_2656/master/4426.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5375e199647dc70407c784e534ed0336","title":"new starbucks policy allows nonpaying guests use restrooms","story":"Move comes after company was accused of bias when two black men were arrested for sitting without ordering anything Starbucks has told its employees to allow all guests to use store facilities, including restrooms, regardless of their spending.The move comes a month after the coffee giant found itself accused of discriminatory practices, after a store manager in Philadelphia called the police  on two black men who asked to use the bathroom without purchasing anything and then refused to leave. The new policy was announced on Saturday in a company-wide letter that stated: “Any person who enters our spaces, including patios, cafes and restrooms, regardless of whether they make a purchase, is considered a customer.”Previously, Starbucks employees had been free to exercise judgment about nonpaying guests. The company said the new policy would apply to its more than 8,000 company-operated US cafes. It would issue different guidelines for its international stores, it said.The Philadelphia store involved in the 12 April incident had signs informing visitors that the bathrooms were for paying customers only. After the police were called on Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson, the men were arrested and spent hours in jail.They were not charged and later reached settlements that included a nominal financial sum and “a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities”. “I want to thank Donte and Rashon for their willingness to reconcile,” said Starbucks chief executive Kevin Johnson, announcing the settlement. “Starbucks will continue to take actions that stem from this incident to repair and reaffirm our values and vision for the kind of company we want to be.” The chain plans to close its company-operated stores next Sunday afternoon, to give employees anti-bias training. In 2015, Starbucks initiated a program to encourage employees to discuss race with customers. The directive was quickly dropped. Under the new policy, customers will be able to stay in stores unless they’re “behaving in a disruptive manner”. The company has yet to offer guidelines on what constitutes disruptive behaviour or what procedures managers and baristas should follow. Starbucks employees should call 911 if a situation presents an immediate danger or threat to employee or customer safety, the company said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"im worth more than what i put on my face","story":"Cook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsCook, food stylist and writer  Anna Jones reflects on how she discovered a signature look to suit her work and family worldsIn my life, I’ve inhabited many different worlds. I’ve been through phases of dressing like a goth, a hippy and a really girly girl. As a student, I read economics and philosophy, then worked for a PR company where everyone dressed in suits. Then, after reading an article that said you should follow your passion according to which part of the newspaper you read first, I pivoted into a career in food with an apprenticeship at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen restaurant. I’ve worked hot shifts in busy kitchens, and now I spend my time testing recipes, going on food photoshoots and writing about cooking, alongside looking after my two-year-old son at home. But through it all, I’ve kept a very consistent look. I’ve always admired women who reinvent themselves dramatically, but that’s just never been my way. Happily, I’ve always been content in my own skin and I put that down to my mum.Looking back on myself as a little girl, I was so pretty and sweet but I didn’t always feel it. I wore glasses, which I hated, so I ditched them for contact lenses as soon as I could. However, at quite a young age I realised that despite what I looked like, my value came from my inside not my outside. That discovery was thanks to Mum. She really instilled in my sister, Laura, and me that makeup was there for us to use if we wanted it, but that it wasn’t something we should put on for anyone beyond ourselves. As a teenager I would play around with pink pearlescent lipsticks and questionable eyeshadows and it was always a fun part of dressing up – it never felt essential. As a proud feminist, Mum has only ever dressed for herself, and is naturally very beautiful. She has the most vibrant, glowing skin and has never worn a scrap of foundation. I carry her belief inside me, which is that I’m worth more than what I put on my face.Following my apprenticeship, I worked in restaurant kitchens in London and around the world. I’d swapped the corporate world of heels and power suits for a predominantly male environment. I’d still wear makeup in the kitchen but not too much – opening an oven door, for instance, can melt off your mascara. I’d wear chef’s whites, made for men, with my hair scraped back. The chef’s outfit was defeminising and sometimes that was useful, especially on the occasions where I’d have to bring out my inner alpha female. But I also wanted to feel like a woman – and to feel like myself – and a little makeup helped me mark myself out from the boys, even if it was just a lick of mascara, some blusher and a dot of concealer.When I left the kitchens to work for Jamie Oliver on his food team, helping him to write recipes, make his TV shows and make his food look good in pictures, I was introduced to a whole new world of photoshoots, lights and cameras.And, thanks to my work, I’ve had my eyes opened to the fact that there’s more than just one makeup setting – it doesn’t have to always be a natural base and a flick of eyeliner.This was brought home to me in the run up to my wedding, two years ago. John and I married in a beautiful church on an island in north Wales. It was an idyllic setting but I wasn’t sure I’d be able to get a makeup artist to take the trip, so my dear friend Ceri bought me a three-hour makeup lesson in London with an amazing woman called Sasha, so that I could do my own on the day. It was fantastic and so much better than watching a YouTube tutorial. Obviously I don’t often recreate the look I wore on my wedding day (although it was very natural), but thanks to that lesson, I have a few different “faces” that I can bring out, depending on the occasion. And while I’m often happy to embrace the day bare-faced, I do have a go-to look that suits me most days. Having never been a morning person – and now with my son Dylan, two, to look after – I can do the whole thing in seven minutes: light foundation, cream concealer, bronzer, peachy blusher, eyelash curlers, mascara and a smear of lip balm. I’ve done it on the tube and in the back of a taxi.There’s a definite synergy that connects the way I look and the ethos behind my style of cooking. My recipes are full of fresh, vibrant, earthy flavours and that’s reflected in how I present myself. I like clothes made from natural fabrics that feel good on my skin in colours that reflect nature – my love of things that come from the earth pervades every aspect of my life. With the food I make, I try to put joy at the centre of every plate, and that’s how I approach getting ready in the morning. Those seven minutes are probably the only time I spend on myself during the whole day. It’s a ritual that helps me to feel bright and ready to face the day.Photography: Brian Daly and Louisa Parry"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb107c33c4ddb41859e889c403c4e6e671132a79/0_218_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b22cf6cac0b5c437eddc85477ce077d8","title":"bishop michael curry sermon history harry meghan wedding","story":"The candle flames were trembling. The pulpit was on fire. The bride and groom were waiting. As were the Queen, Oprah, Idris Elba, and Doria Ragland, now the world’s most famous yoga teacher. Just before he got on to the subject of fire, Bishop Michael Curry, the first African-American leader of the US Episcopal church, promised the happy couple, “and with this I’ll sit down, we got to get y’all married”. But there’s a lot to say about the French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and his relevance to modern technology and the concept of love and how this relates to Martin Luther King, so he went on for another three minutes.Curry’s sermon was one of three moments during the royal wedding when I felt moved. I had not expected to be moved. I had expected to remain full of cold indignation at the pomp and aristocratic indulgence of the day, at the preparatory shooing of the homeless off the streets of Windsor by police officers who should be tending to more important things like knife crime, at the £32m shamelessly spent amid the rising presence of foodbanks and child poverty. The first of these moments was Ragland arriving at the chapel, a black woman quietly alone, being assisted from her car by a representative of an institution that had partaken in her oppression and was now required to respect her. The other was the Kingdom Choir’s beautiful rendition of Stand By Me, in part because it followed the sermon.Reading from his iPad, gesticulating, swinging his robes, smiling, rocking back and forth on his feet, Curry was in complete contrast to the solemn and stationary ecclesiastical address that preceded his. Where there was stillness, now there was movement. For 14 minutes he preached in the full-throated, uninhibited, theatrical and emotive style of the traditional African-American church. He preached of Moses and Jesus of Nazareth, the Hebrew scriptures and the “old slaves in America’s antebellum South” who recognised in their singing of spirituals, “even in the midst of their captivity”, that there is “a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole”. Quoting from Martin Luther King to begin and end the speech, this was not something ever witnessed within the lofty walls of the pinnacle of the Anglican establishment at a royal wedding. This was a speech that could have been lifted straight out of the pages of James Baldwin or ZZ Packer.An ardent campaigner for social justice, particularly on immigration and same-sex marriage, Chicago-born Curry, himself a descendent of slaves, did not tone down his passionate message of the social and political power of love in order to align with the reserve of his pale and stately onlookers. He did not filter. He did it black, with music in his arms, and rhythm in his voice, and a looseness and openness in his face that supposed an almost familial acquaintance with his audience.In his world, words do not travel alone from the mouth, with just their letters and their grammar for company. Here the body comes too, giving life to the words, lifting them into the air to float and dance into comprehension and human feeling. For Zara Tindall, captured open-mouthed in her pricey, shiny teal in the pews, it was something to behold.The expressions on the faces of the congregation around the church were also something to behold, ranging from empathy to bemusement to confusion to downright scorn. Four minutes in, Camilla Parker Bowles’s ludicrous hat was trembling as she held down her head: was she laughing? Prince Charles was also bowed, red around the ears, more so than usual: was he?There was half a smirk at the Duchess of Cambridge’s mouth, and, when Curry exclaimed: “Oh that’s the balm in Gilead!”, throwing up his hands in emphasis, the Queen straightened in her chair, purse-lipped. Meanwhile, Oprah swayed. Ragland looked steadily on, a little sadly, as if aware of something of which others were not, yet also with an innate sweetness while her daughter sat holding hands with her prince, occasionally conferring in love-soaked whispers.It was a sermon that will go down in history as a moment when the enduring seat of colonialism was brought before the Lord, and questioned in its own house. In the mention of slavery was the inherent accusation of white silver-spoon complicity, and that this union should not go forth without acknowledging it.“Love is the way,” Curry chanted, in a rolling, conversational repetition borne of the deep south. “When love is the way, we actually treat each other well” – he put his hand on his hip and his elbow on the lectern – “like we are actually a family”. A utopia for our time indeed, delivered with a grand humility apparently wasted on some of its listeners, who were not quite expecting such blackness from a black bride."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8712897b759869db5c6cf57030427b5c418aaeff/0_0_7142_4286/master/7142.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05adca9ebac11739c5091f7c8511b18b","title":"readers weather pages guardian","story":"Feedback on our redesigned weather pages has created a wind of change, whose effects will be felt from Brighton to BelfastMany readers who responded to the ’s recent transformation into a tabloid had highly specific reservations, including about the redesigned weather page.

Noting that her job was “to cater for all readers, which inevitably means disappointing some”, she was nevertheless flexible.I can report that weight of reader sentiment will lead to some adjustments, to be introduced in the coming weeks.

The tabloid initially reduced that to eight, but none were south of Bristol. In future, Brighton will be added, and various other locations are likely to be rotated in and out. Belfast will return.The feedback was a reminder that in this era of transition in the provision and consumption of media, not everyone looks up the forecast on an app. And newspapers have other longstanding, humble and practical roles as artefacts.News-on-paper serves functions beyond the journalism it initially conveys. Unfurled on trains or strewn on tables, a newspaper used to be thought to flag the reader’s politics or education. The smartphones people commune with on the train tell you nothing of what they are reading, only whether they are Apple or non-Apple users.Two readers had Berliner pangs because its pages were the perfect size to line, respectively, the woodbox and the recycling bin. But they were adjusting, they said. Why, asked another, are scrunched pages of the tabloid less effective at cleaning the windows.

These anti-monarchists managed to attract a grand total of 32,000 signatures from an adult population of more than 50 million people.I take no particular pleasure in saying this – I am not an enthusiast for hereditary monarchy – but the royals are in robust shape. A country that has become highly cynical about its other institutions makes an exception for monarchy. The crown has weathered the tumultuous decades of the Queen’s long reign more successfully than any of its competitors in the realm. The end of empire, the rise of meritocracy and the death of deference socialism and Thatcherism immigration, globalisation and populism wars and peace booms and busts: successive waves of great social and economic change have crashed over Britain and the anachronism of a hereditary head of state is still standing. To endure for so long in a democratic age is a feat that is both remarkable and rarely registered.Prince Philip calls them The Firm and it can be useful to think of the Windsors as a family business. Shareholder approval for the 92-year-old boss is high. The Queen enjoys public satisfaction ratings that politicians can only fantasise about and dare not quarrel with. The republican sympathies expressed by the Labour MP Emma Dent Coad are striking only because they are so unusual to hear from a parliamentarian. The daring radicals of the Scots Nats say they would keep the Queen as head of state of an independent Scotland. In Jeremy Corbyn, Labour has a leader who is a career-long republican, but the party’s last manifesto did not propose to retire the monarchy and he says he has no intention of getting rid of the Queen, with whom he has “nice chats”.Popular support for royalty can be partly explained by the power of contrasts. The Church of England still plays a role in national life, but attendance in its places of worship has been in long-term decline since the Queen acceded to the throne in 1952. The BBC, the monopoly broadcaster when it televised her coronation, now competes for the nation’s attention in a cacophonously digitised world. Other institutions that once rivalled the monarchy as magnets for national sentiment have lost their lustre. The military has been shriven by spending cuts and is still not recovered from the humiliations suffered in Afghanistan and Iraq. In the year that the Queen succeeded her father, someone published a book called The Glory of Parliament. No\u0026nbspone would commission that title today. In the 1980s, monarchists silenced republicans by asking: President Thatcher? In the 1990s, it was: President Blair? Now monarchists can mock: President Trump?The Firm survived a torrid stretch in the 1990s. If you are of an age to recall “squidgygate”, “Camillagate” and “toe-sucking”, you are old enough to remember when royal marriages were falling apart in front of a gawping nation’s eyes. As the House of Windsor rocked on what seemed to be crumbling foundations, the heir to the throne and his former wife publicly traded accusations of adultery. “The War of the Waleses” destroyed the claim to be an exemplar of family life. When Windsor Castle was ravaged by fire, many saw it as a doomy metaphor for monarchy and the Queen talked miserably about her “annus horribillis”.So royalty’s subsequent recovery after the death of Diana is also down to its capacity for reinvention. The Firm has been ruthless about sidelining products for which there is little public demand (Prince Andrew, Prince Edward) while introducing younger, more popular lines (William and Kate George, Charlotte and Louis Harry and Meghan). You do not have to buy into all the over-heated gush about Meghan Markle “modernising the monarchy” to see that she does inject something fresh into the royal collection that will extend its customer base.As millions witnessed yesterday, they have a genius for staging pageant that is both glamorous and populist. Marriages, along with births, are two of the signature products of the crown. The global TV audience for the wedding was big. None of the world’s other monarchies has such a potent international brand and this reflects back to Britain to help The Firm consolidate its standing with the domestic audience. During the opening ceremony of the London Olympics, nearly a billion viewers worldwide watched the Queen play herself in a comedic routine with Daniel Craig as James Bond before appearing to parachute with him into the Olympic stadium.Everything must change for everything to stay the same. Adapting to survive is a strategy that the British monarchy has been practising artfully for a long time. Kingsley Martin wrote about “the evolution of the popular monarchy” back in 1936. He disapproved of what he called an “irrational attitude” towards “the new cult of monarchy”. His mistake was to judge it in terms of rationality. Walter Bagehot, writing in the Victorian era, was more acute when he identified the “magic” of “theatrical show” as one of the essential attributes of a successful crown. If he were writing today, Bagehot might update himself by adding “celebrity” and “soap opera”. The job involves a lot of performance, as Meghan Markle, a thespian by profession, seems to have understood from the moment she joined the team.The Queen may have had no formal training in acting, but she is the majesty of royal image. She has consolidated her popularity by the faultless execution of her role as a stately emblem of continuity, stability and discretion. In 92 years of life, 66 of them on the throne, she has defied the fashion of the times by giving away very little of her self. We have to guess at her political opinions, because she has always comprehended that a constitutional monarch is not allowed to express any. She has never faced an election, but she understands that the House of Windsor can only be sustained so long as it has broad-based public support.It is silly to deny – and some republicans make themselves look foolish when they do so – that many people derive a lot of innocent enjoyment and pride from the royals. The endurance of the crown into the second decade of the 21st century does, though, come with costs. There is a symbolic potency to having a head of state who was born into the position. This institutionalisation of privilege and inequality at the pinnacle of the state doesn’t help Britain’s well-documented difficulties with social mobility. Royal shows are an escapist distraction for a fractious nation, but when the confetti is swept away and the bunting taken down, Britain is still left to wrestle with its deep isions. Another concern is that Britain’s monarchy is all that much of the world ever notices about our country and this entrenches an international image of these islands as a heritage park.For royalists, the worm in the bud is that the entire enterprise is anchored on the respect for the nonagenarian whose record time on the throne has defined monarchy for so many decades. Will Prince Charles, a much less popular figure than his mother, make a hash of it when it is his turn to take the helm of The Firm? Many who have interacted with him worry that an overeagerness to express his opinions will make him a isive king. A recent biography by Tom Bower portrayed the heir to the throne as whingeing, self-obsessed and grasping, a Prince Charmless. Mr Bower is never knowingly kind to his subjects, but if Charles is only half as awful as he is depicted in that book, he could be a risky occupant of the throne. This worries some royalists so much that they argue that Charles should renounce the succession in favour of his son. William and Kate, who say nothing interesting and say it awfully nicely, seem to have a firmer grasp of the rules of modern monarchy than he does. Polls report that a lot of voters agree that The Firm ought to skip a generation, which suggests that many of the public either do not understand the hereditary principle or don’t have any reverence for it.A lot has changed since the Queen’s distant ancestor crossed the Channel in 1066 to seize the throne, but one thing remains as true now as it was at the time of the Norman Conquest. The peculiarity of monarchy is that it is an institution embodied in a personality. Public consent for its continued existence is inextricably enmeshed with the country’s opinion of the head that wears the crown. It is the paradox of modern hereditary monarchy that it exists only for so long as it can keep winning an endless public popularity contest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e5f972c2f51ce67f593c36689177c495d430120/0_156_3649_2189/master/3649.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65c2e94754a5a5e30cefd62a01fe47e3","title":"spirit britain royal wedding brexit","story":"The rest of the world is baffled by Britain – and understandably so. In the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, directed by Danny Boyle, we dramatised a confidence, openness and multiplicity that only a nation at ease with itself could muster. The global “soft power” of our language, cultural and scientific institutions, and international development programmes – still ringfenced by the Treasury – remains formidable. And on Saturday, hundreds of millions around the world watched the royal wedding: as glorious a fusion of pageantry and pluralism, of monarchy and modernity, as you could hope for.Yet this spirit of generous self-assurance has its evil twin. We are also the country of Brexit of Nigel Farage of Jacob Rees-Mogg posing outside No 10 to deliver a petition demanding cuts to the aid budget and, most recently and shamefully, of the Windrush scandal.Which is the authentic Britain? Open or closed? Warm or frostily parochial? Both, I suppose. Most countries are, to use a word much-loved by Nick Clegg, “bicephalous”: two-headed and contradictory. The question we should ask in 2018 is: which of the two heads dominates?On my travels in the past year, I have encountered understandable confusion about our national trajectory. To crunch a complex series of perceptions into a seriously oversimplified narrative, the view from beyond our shores runs as follows: Britain was in terrible shape in 1979. Margaret Thatcher’s shock therapy, painful for a great many, laid the foundations of renewed national prosperity. Labour’s election in 1997 marked a determination to match economic growth with social justice and liberalism.According to this happy version of events, the 2012 Olympics represented the culmination of more than three decades of regenerative work: a global festival in which Britain declared itself to be both open for business and open in spirit. Into which narrative, the rusty ner of Brexit was thrown with clanking ferocity four years later. Suddenly, Britain was declaring its furious hostility to “mass immigration”, to its putative imprisonment as a “vassal state”, to the supposed\u0026nbspmutilation of its island heritage. Optimism had yielded to fear. We were, to quote Nigel Farage’s vile poster, at\u0026nbsp“breaking point”. You can forgive the rest of the world its perplexity. When, exactly, did Britain decide angry nativism was the way forward?This global confusion about who we are and what we want has profoundly practical consequences. Ask any senior diplomat or chief executive and they will tell you the same thing: namely, that technical detail forms the structure of any deal, alliance or treaty, but that the much more nebulous question of culture, shared ideals and emotional identity determines the foundation. Trade agreements and investment decisions are not decided by algorithm alone. Each side must ask: what sort of partner am I aligning myself with? Will my employees be heading towards an outstretched hand or a “hostile environment”?If I had to single out the principal cause of our national identity crisis, I would cite the catastrophic absence of leadership on immigration policy. The issue has maddened us, unnecessarily and tragically. It has drained much of our national confidence, made us mean, bred an uncharitable insularity.In their words, deeds and tactical silences, politicians of both main parties have allowed a series of myths to enter and settle into mainstream discourse: that migrants depress wages and take jobs from indigenous citizens that migrants are a drain on the taxpayer that only the “metropolitan elite” benefits from migrant labour that migrants are more likely to commit crimes. All this is rubbish, and deserves to be robustly and repeatedly dismissed as such – not left to fester in the national consciousness. I also believe immigration is culturally enriching. But then I have skin in the game (the surname is a clue). So let us concentrate on economic necessity.A familiar refrain of pro-Brexit MPs is that their constituents were somehow “not consulted” on recent immigration. To which the only answer should be: oh yes they were. They were consulted when they voted repeatedly for an NHS that has the capacity to treat them – an objective that would be unthinkable without migrant labour.They made a decision in favour of immigration when they opted for low-price consumer goods, for rapid delivery services, for facilities and shops that are open around the clock. They chose. We all did. It is outrageous hypocrisy to pretend otherwise.In cabinet, I am told, even the arch-Brexiteers declare that national prosperity should not be sacrificed to the achievement of arbitrarily low net migration targets. Well, thanks a lot. Now they spot the flaw in the plan.To be fair to the Brexit secretary, David Davis, he has repeatedly conceded that immigration policy post-Brexit will require many exemptions to meet the needs of the labour market. And as for all those shiny trade deals we are promised after 29 March 2019: the immigration minister, Caroline Nokes, told a Commons committee in February that visas could “absolutely” be exchanged for commercial access in future negotiations.Brexit encapsulates this cognitive dissonance and its damaging consequences: it is about much more than our institutional relationship with the EU. I long for political leaders with the courage and candour to declare that the great challenges facing this country – automation, fiscal fairness, entrenched poverty, human longevity – have nothing to do with immigration, race or the much-needed influx of newcomers. That it has taken a royal wedding to reinstate this straightforward truth should shame our drab political class."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b24a15975c28448eb0c5dba56bfb10ab47d2470/0_126_3568_2140/master/3568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8bc341b2107e6b1be076b07e2f1ff6e","title":"the guardian view on brexit and the royal wedding which is the real britain","story":"Every ancient nation takes the long walk to modernity in its own roundabout way. None is as ramrod straight as the Long Walk in Windsor Great Park down which the royal newlyweds were driven through happy crowds on a memorable and sun-kissed Saturday. National journeys between past and present are more tortuous. Interruptions, setbacks and turns in the road abound. That’s one reason why the royal wedding should not be oversimplified as a transformative, nothing-more-need-be-said knockout blow for a modern tolerant Britain over the older uptight and status-ridden version. But let’s get real about what happened at the weekend. The racial inclusivity of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding was something new. It was a milestone moment on that long and winding walk to a fairer Britain.It cannot be overlooked that Saturday’s uplifting events took place in a country disfigured by Brexit. The disjunction is real and painful. The same nation that proved it is now more at ease than ever with the different heritages of its modern self is also the nation that is split down the middle over whether to shut its doors on the world or remain confidently part of it. Part of the Brexit tragedy, Professor Robert Ford argued in our Observer sister paper this week, is that the more, as a people, we think about the migration issue, the more open we have become to a fairer, more liberal view of the subject. On that evidence, and on the evidence of Saturday’s events, this country’s long walk is now at a critical crossroads.Yet Britain is not alone in trying find its way to its own form of modernity. Across the Irish Sea this week, the Irish Republic is grappling with the challenge too, in its own distinctive way. On Friday, Ireland will vote in a referendum whether to repeal or retain the so-called “eighth amendment” clause in its constitution. This clause effectively outlaws abortion in most circumstances. For most of the campaign, opinion polls have suggested that the “yes” side, in favour of repeal, would win. We hope so. Yet as polling day nears, doubts have bubbled up. The possibility that rural Irish voters may be preparing to send a Brexit or Trump-style rebuff to the Irish urban elite haunts much of the coverage and comment.Britain’s ambivalence about migration and Ireland’s over abortion may seem very separate arguments, with little in common. In fact each highlights a national state of mind – and each has to be seen in the context of Brexit. Every year more than 3,000 women from the Irish Republic travel to Britain for abortions that are illegal at home. So do about 500 women from Northern Ireland, where the abortion laws are also very restrictive. Both the south and the north restrict abortion in the confident knowledge that Irish women can travel to Britain for terminations. That approach is cruel, hypocritical and unjust to women. It may also be rudely exposed as complacent if Britain crashes out of the EU next year, raising questions about whether the common travel area between the UK and the Republic can continue.The commentator Fintan O’Toole wrote recently that Ireland’s mentality on abortion is not so far removed from the mentality of Brexit. In each case – over migration in Britain, and abortion in Ireland – a proud island nation has defined itself against a caricature of a permissive Europe. In each case it has pretended that an ancestral fantasy of its own purity and exceptionalism can be upheld. If Ireland votes no on Friday, it will take a perverse stance against modernity, just as Britain did over Brexit. The long walk will never be a straight line. But it is a journey that must be taken, by princes and peoples alike."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef0713823bc906a91949735cd2f2ba4d338afdac/0_111_4134_2481/master/4134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94792a988e43908e8a7992a432ff3039","title":"the guardian view on the grenfell tower inquiry necessary but not sufficient","story":"The public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire finally begins this week with a fortnight of testimony from friends and relatives of the 71 people who died in the terrible blaze on the night of 14 June 2018. The blackened shell of the 24-storey tower has become a symbol of the inequalities of Britain. Almost a year on, there remains a disturbing feeling that justice is far from being delivered. The families of the dead are a long way from possessing any sense of completion. The inquiry, led by a judge, is a necessary step, but it is far from being a sufficient one.The government has yet to make much progress on the houses that the former Grenfell residents need – only one in three of the families are living in a permanent new home. Woeful handling of the situation by Kensington and Chelsea council has not improved much since it dumped its ineffective leadership last year, bringing in a new head who’d never been to a tower block. Unsurprisingly the council continues to build fewer affordable homes than any other London borough.Justice must also been seen to be done. Many fear that ministers will never fully hold to account those culpable, shying away from taking on vested interests in the building industry. This dread deepened last week when mixed signals were sent over whether the use of combustible materials to clad high-rise buildings would be banned. In the case of Grenfell the “cladding” consisted of aluminium sheets fixed to a quarter-inch core of polyethylene, a material so flammable it is compared to petrol. Australia had a high-rise fire in 2014 it now has a ban on unsafe cladding. Dubai had one in 2015 it has a ban on high-risk materials. More than 300 tower blocks in the UK are wrapped in similiar dangerous cladding. It seems obvious that Britain must do the same.It was bewildering that last week’s official review of building regulations, commissioned by the government, did not prohibit the use of combustible materials. The report’s author, Dame Judith Hackitt, told the BBC on Thursday morning that she didn’t think a ban would work. This was contradicted by James Brokenshire, the housing secretary, who told MPs he would consult on a ban, but not implement one immediately. His defence was that the cladding on Grenfell Tower was unlawful under existing building rules and should not have been used. If that is the case then why are the guilty parties not being tracked down now and held to account? Ministers cannot hide behind public inquiries.It seems clear that official guidance was drafted to be vague enough to convince parts of the industry that a material that was unsafe was legal. Yet prominent Conservatives since 2010 missed chances to tighten up regulations. Gavin Barwell, the then housing minister (now Downing Street chief of staff), did not take the opportunity offered by a coroner’s inquest after a fire in a 14-storey block where six people died. He neglected to uncover the dangers of cladding materials in a review of guidelines. Brandon Lewis, now party chairman, said he wanted to “exhaust all non-regulatory options before we introduce new regulations” when it was recommended that tall buildings were retrofitted with sprinklers.

When Campion broke through and was recognised as an auteur by her male peers – with the Palme d’Or and three Oscars in her handbag – feminists assumed that more women artists would follow in her wake. They were wrong.There was no great bursting of the financial and cultural dam that held back women film-makers. Instead their work filtered through in drips, excluded from directing blockbusters, and excluded from competition at Cannes and other festivals. “I think we got caught in a complicated supplicancy, a very sophisticated supplicancy,” says Campion.But now, a quarter of a century later, Campion feels that time is up for supplicancy as the #MeToo movement reverberates in the film industry and beyond. “Right now, we’re in a really special moment. I’m so excited about it. It’s like the Berlin wall coming down, like the end of apartheid. I think we have lived in one of the more ferocious patriarchal periods of our time, the 80s, 90s and noughties. Capitalism is such a macho force. I felt run over.”Dipping croissants into coffee in Soho on a trip from her home in New Zealand to London, Campion seems the last person anyone would dare to run over, with her iron will, silver hair and ready laugh. But even after The Piano’s success, Campion’s journey was never easy, and her insistence on a stubbornly female gaze in her work did not translate into big box office returns.She made The Portrait of a Lady (1996) with Nicole Kidman, Holy Smoke (1999) with Kate Winslet, and In the Cut (2003), with Meg Ryan no longer playing the bubbly creature of romcoms but instead handcuffing a detective and having sex with him. That film is experiencing a renaissance back then it was too much for the mainstream male critics. As Campion recently noted: “There’s this sort of mountain of corduroy you have to get through.”So after In the Cut she took a break to look after her daughter Alice Englert, and reappeared in 2009 with Bright Star, the poet Keats’s story from the point of view of his lover Fanny Brawne. It was not until the massive success of the two television series of Top of the Lake (2013 and 2017) that the world caught up with Campion’s point of view again.In 2017, Cannes premiered Top of the Lake: China Girl to acclaim. It was also the 70th anniversary of the festival and Campion joined all the male Palme d’Or-winners on stage. She was the lone woman. “I hadn’t ever really thought about the numbers of women and men that had won the Palme d’Or. I still really hadn’t taken it in. That was the most shocking thing I’d ever been involved in. If there had been no women it wouldn’t be an issue, but man after man came up. I thought, ‘Oh my God! What is going on?’”Money, was the answer. The female talent is there, but the financial backing is missing in film, less so now in television. “I guess at this age I expect to make Top of the Lake as I want it, without any concern for other people’s opinions and taste. I just do what I want, and weirdly people love it.”Many of the themes of Top of the Lake were hatched in The Piano. Wilderness madness colonial and immigrant stories, from the Maori community of New Zealand to Asian immigrants in Sydney and above all, strange, bolshy women unbowed by life’s struggles.“Rewatching my films is like digging up buried bones,” says Campion, who is 64. Yet when she saw The Piano again recently (she laughs that she could only find a French dubbed version, but at least the heroine played by Holly Hunter is mute), “I really felt excited by it. I thought, my God, this is a film told from a female point of view and nowadays that’s still so rare. Even when a story appears to be from a female point of view, it’s often an apology for it.”The Piano is now a classic, unforgettable, with its powerful, surreal imagery, soul-scarring amputation scene, silent heroine, and above all, the erotic electricity played out note by note between Harvey Keitel and Hunter, seated at the carved rosewood piano in a hut deep in the bush.Each watching of the 1850s drama reveals more riches. There is the mute but emotionally devastating performance by Hunter as Ada McGrath, a Scotswoman sent like baggage with her piano to New Zealand to marry a man she has never met. Hunter and Anna Paquin – who plays her young daughter – both won Academy awards, as did Campion’s screenplay. The musical score from Michael Nyman often takes the place of dialogue and the cinematography from Stuart Dryburgh shifts from the epic to the intimate. In writing and directing, Campion set herself a series of challenges: a wordless protagonist, a hostile landscape, a colonial conundrum and then allowed the film to burst out of its own carefully constructed corset.The image of a piano stranded with a woman and child on a volcanic beach beneath glowering cliffs epitomised Ada’s predicament in an isolated Maori and British community in the bush. But the necessary interior nature of Ada’s world, only allowed an outlet through music, sign language and facial expressions revealing contempt or wilfulness, subverts the male-controlled world. Sam Neill plays her husband Alisdair Stewart, who is silently outmanoeuvred by Ada, until his frustration turns to violence.Eventually, the axe falls, but until then, “Ada was experiencing things for herself in her own body and she could close the patriarchy out,” says Campion. “It was really strong for me to see that, and also the intimacy, sexuality and sensuality from a more female point of view.” Surprisingly for the time, when Keitel’s Baines is eventually given permission by Ada to freely make love to her, his first move is to kneel down and disappear beneath her crinoline, favouring her pleasure over his own.The power is also shown to be literally in Ada’s hands she strokes her husband’s naked buttocks with the caresses she also lavishes on the piano keys, but refuses to allow him to touch her in return. Stewart is humiliated. As Campion notes, “This is a very sexual story, and to see him overwhelmed and unable to control what’s happening … that’s quite sexy.”Campion’s taste for wild passion in the wilderness was partly inculcated by the Brontës when she was growing up in Wellington, New Zealand, the daughter of theatrical parents. “I always loved Emily Brontë’s imagination. I feel like she saved my life, in the sense of giving me powerful female stories. To have that model for how a woman and an artist could be was very involving to me.”Speaking of Wuthering Heights, Campion noted Catherine’s strength. “She was not pliant. She was firm of mind and conviction.” For the director, Heathcliff “was a dark metaphor for sexual drive, and Emily had a sexual drive, obviously, and she rode it like a horse.” Campion roars with laughter. “My psyche understood that at a time when it wasn’t being much explored in literature and film.”Sealing these moments on screen, often more with pictures than words, is one of Campion’s great skills. “The most powerful experiences we have as humans are a combination of psyche, love and erotica, which can really lock you in an extraordinarily powerful way to experiences beyond what you know and beyond what you can control,” says Campion. “If you look back at those moments, they are often powerful awakenings, way beyond your comfort zone. There’s a sort of calling against decorum, against what’s best.”She has always championed the unconventional, from her first feature Sweetie (1989), a punkish and ultimately devastating family drama about two sisters, one of whom is mentally troubled. Her second film, An Angel at my Table (1990), was a three-hour television biography of writer Janet Frame, which was so cinematic that it was given a theatrical release.Campion was also fearless about tackling a film with a large cast of Maori actors, and while a few of The Piano’s scenes border on embarrassing in retrospect, she made the effort to find a Maori film director and advisers to work with her. “I had an easier time because I had been out of the country for a long time, so I was desensitised to this feeling that a white person couldn’t have a Maori character. I thought that was crazy when there was a chance for different roles.” There were complexities: some of the Maori actors did not speak their native language. “They felt shame about it, but they learned it. What they really found offensive was the pidgin English we had written, so we changed that and the problem went away. They wanted to work with me – they don’t like people charging in and creating ‘blackgrounds’.”While The Piano has become a landmark of Antipodean cinema, it was in fact financed by a French company, encouraged to take a punt on Campion by the Cannes film scout Pierre Rissient, who died earlier this month just before this interview. “I’m a little bit subdued today because of Pierre,” says Campion. “He brought all my films to Cannes.” Rissient discovered her film Peel, which won best short in 1986.Thanks to Rissient’s championing, The Piano was made and edited while Campion was pregnant with her first child by her husband Colin Englert (second unit director on the film). She flew out to Cannes in May 1993 to the premiere, but she was unable to stay until the end of the festival to pick up her Palme d’Or.“I had to fly back before I couldn’t fly. I was there for the screening but it wasn’t really a good time because my blood pressure was shooting up, with interviews and managing the pregnancy. So I was back in Sydney and I heard that we’d won, which was amazing. Then really shortly after I found out my baby was seriously in trouble – born alive, and died at 11 days. That was the worst time of my life. I really didn’t enjoy any of the success. It almost felt like ‘at the cost of’, weirdly.” Campion still wears her scars painfully close to the surface. “For that time, it felt like that. I did six months of suffering and grieving intensely.”Then she got pregnant with Alice, who now stars in Top of the Lake. Campion says the loss of her son, Jasper, changed her forever. “I am incredibly grateful for having that whole experience of that baby that did not live, because it put me in touch with that kind of suffering. It just changed my perspective forever. When you’ve had a death like that you become part of a club you never leave, and because of the love you feel for them, you never resent it.”The experience resonates in her more recent work in Top of the Lake, in which Robin (Elisabeth Moss) reveals that in the past she was raped and gave the baby away for adoption. She searches for her lost child, and other stories feature surrogacy, miscarriages and loss. “This whole area of female experience is so unknown, but it’s like the equivalent of going to war, except no one makes movies about it,” says Campion.But everyone is making television about it, from Big Little Lies to The Handmaid’s Tale, and Campion’s favoured actresses, Nicole Kidman and Moss, seem to be everywhere. “Hero stories are wearing thin. We have lived a male life, we have lived within the patriarchy. It’s something else to take ownership of your own story.”Ever the iconoclast, Campion is going against the trend by writing her first male lead in her new (untitled) film. “Because at last I feel I can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcddef938350d0ab9728b6e92fd65d06de93f71f/405_306_3523_2114/master/3523.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41f420a444862c2c11c8082601602d2a","title":"manuel neuer germany bayern munich goalkeeper","story":"Modern football has a lot in common with the German autobahn. The speed of the game has no limits these days and the players are like finely calibrated sports cars: faster, sleeker and more powerful than ever. Movement is constant, and yet\u0026nbspthere remains an order to things,\u0026nbspa reminder that even on the edge, there are forces that prevent chaos. No player better illustrates this than Manuel Neuer, the world’s\u0026nbspbest goalkeeper, who has redefined his position. “I’m a little bit risky, but I’m standing for security and protection, and you have to give your team-mates that feeling as well,” says Neuer, captain of Bayern Munich and Germany. “In life, I’m a guy who likes to drive a car quite fast, but I wear a seat belt at the same time.”The downside of Neuer’s approach is the football version of hara-kiri. If he misjudges the speed and trajectory of the ball or the striker and arrives too late, he may concede a goal and look silly in the process. “I don’t feel the fear in my head in this moment,” he says. “I am always thinking positive. It’s all about the first step. If I think I will get the ball, I go out. I can’t stop halfway because the goal is empty and the player would have the opportunity to shoot. You make the reaction, and then, of course, you have to be sure to get the ball. But it’s years of practice. You can’t say from one day to the other: ‘Now I will do it,’ you know? You have to feel it.”A goalkeeper from the age of four, he discovered early on that he had a leading foot and a standing leg, and for him it felt more comfortable to jump to his left than to his right in order to make a save. Dives to his right, he says, would often result in awkward landings that gave him bruises on his right hip.Working with a coach, Neuer had to train himself to explode to his right more easily, just as a right-footed player would work on passing and shooting with his left. Even today, Neuer acknowledges that ing and extending his body to his right to stop a shot won’t look the same as when he does the same thing to his left. “It’s the same power, but it looks different because the body changes when you are up in the air,” he says. “When you are lying down on the grass and need to stand up, you stand up in a different way on each side. It’s not symmetrical. The important thing is that you can jump high and long and stand up quickly. It doesn’t have to look perfect, but it has to be quick.”Yet shot stopping, which was once the hallmark of a proficient goalkeeper, is now a bare-minimum requirement. The 21st-century keeper also needs to organise the back line and set-piece defence, command the box on crosses, disrupt opposing attacks outside the box and initiate his team’s attack.Comfort on the ball with both feet is mandatory, as is the ability to play passes to moving targets over short and long distances, with your feet and with an overhand throw. What’s more, the strategic trend of extreme defensive pressing all over the field means goalkeepers often need to make themselves available as pressure-release valves for defenders needing to get rid of the ball.If you watch Bayern Munich regularly, it becomes clear that Neuer almost never boots the ball aimlessly downfield, like so many other goalkeepers do. Under Pep Guardiola, the word you heard most often from the Bayern players describing their attacking philosophy was “control”. Why would you boom the ball downfield and risk giving up control? “The passing game has become more important,” Neuer says. “We rarely just hammer the ball forward. I probably have twice as many touches of the ball now than I used to have at Schalke.”Bayern Munich’s and Germany’s stranglehold on possession often means Neuer has fewer occasions to demonstrate some of the more traditional goalkeeping skills. But he still has to call upon them at times, knowing that one mistake can turn a game. How does he know when to come out for a cross? The thought process on whether to commit is not much different from deciding whether to leave his box to cut off a through-ball – though there tends to be more human traffic in his path on crosses, requiring him to read even more variables in a split second. “You have to know which players are in your area and whether you have a free way to get to the ball,” he explains. “If I know I can’t get the ball, then I have to stay in.”Television commentators sometimes say goalkeepers should always come out for any cross in their six-yard box. But Neuer argues that is not necessarily the case. “It depends how high the ball is coming into the box,” Neuer says. “If it’s a high ball they can’t reach, you know you can go out. But if it’s a very low ball and a striker is there, it’s very dangerous and you can’t go out.” Even today, there are enough variables that the same keeper who will venture 40 yards from his goal to pick off a through-ball will sometimes refuse to move even six yards, depending on the situation.More commonly, though, Bayern’s and Germany’s obsession with control means the ball is at the other end of the field. Neuer says one of the hardest parts of his job is when he hasn’t faced a shot from the opposition in 45 minutes, and then he’s suddenly called into action. “Sometimes in the winter it’s very cold, you know, especially in Bavaria,” he says, half-smiling but fully serious. “It’s not easy in this moment, because you have to go from 0 to 100.”Such is life on the German autobahn.This is an edited extract from Football 2.0: How the World’s Best Play the Modern Game by Grant Wahl.

It would have been impossible for them not to dwell on the improbable number of chances they missed while chasing an equaliser during the second half of a wild FA Trophy final. They hit the post, shanked wide from close range, had a shot cleared off the line and were thwarted on several occasions by Bromley’s indefatigable goalkeeper, David Gregory. But they refused to be denied.With seconds remaining in the fifth minute of stoppage time the club from a small market town in Northamptonshire, and a ision below Bromley, drew level at last, as a long-range shot by Matt Lowe struck the post and rebounded into the net off the unfortunate defender Roger Johnson. A tense period of extra-time ensued, followed by an even tenser penalty shootout, which had a couple of twists and went to sudden death before Andy Brown, a deputy headmaster by day, struck the decisive blow for Brackley. That triggered scenes of joy at Wembley that will live long in Northamptonshire folklore. “The noise and sheer jubilation was just fantastic,” said their manager, Kevin Wilkin. “Hopefully days like this will happen again on a regular basis.” Hopefully, sure, but replicating drama like this would be a tall order for any club.Nearly 17,000 Bromley fans who turned up at Wembley – more than six times their average home attendance – will not remember this day quite as fondly. What will nag at them is the fact that they came agonisingly close to a precious honour on the club’s first appearance at Wembley since the 1949 FA Amateur Cup. Omar Bugiel fired them into the lead in the 19th minute with a sharp finish following a strong run by Adam Mekki. But Bugiel blazed over the bar in the shootout when victory was there for the taking. Between those two shots Bromley withstood ferocious pressure from Brackley, who last week lost to Harrogate in a promotion play-off in which victory would have enabled them to join Bromley in the National League next season.During one chaotic spell around the hour James Armson came close to scoring three times, hitting the post from six yards, slicing wide from nearly as close and seeing Gregory repel a third effort. Aaron Williams was also foiled, his low shot cleared off the line by Dan Johnson.Bromley twice threatened to wrap up victory on the counterattack but Brandon Hanlon was stopped first by a superb last-ditch tackle by Gareth Dean and then by a good save by Danny Lewis. Dean ventured up the other end in the dying seconds and it was he who applied the pressure that forced Johnson to stab the ball into his own goal. Johnson, a former Premier League defender who won the League Cup here with Birmingham City in 2011, was as distraught as Brackley were delighted.Bromley edged back in front when Gregory saved from Shane Byrne in the first shot of the shootout. But then Bugiel missed and Jack Holland hit the post, setting the scene for Brown to claim victory by slotting into the net, which he duly did before towards the outstretched arms of 5,500 Brackley fans.Brackley’s triumph completed a thrilling double-header of non-league showdowns at the national stadium. Earlier Stockton Town and Thatcham Town contested the FA Vase final, the showpiece competition for clubs from the eighth tier and lower. The teams, from different leagues in the ninth tier, were appearing on this stage for the first time, their runs to the final representing the latest high point in several seasons of remarkable progression by each club. Thatcham, champions of the Hellenic League, won 1-0 thanks to a penalty by their prolific striker, Shane Cooper-Clark.Thatcham had good reason to be confident of scoring as they went into the game, having won their league title this season on goal difference after netting 129 times in 38 matches. The west Berkshire side duly broke the deadlock in the 21st minute thanks to a penalty awarded after a foul by Jamie Ward on Jordan Brown. Cooper-Clark rammed the spotkick into the net, albeit via the left hand of Michael Arthur. That brought the striker’s tally for the season to a preposterous 63 goals.Stockton, a Teeside club who began playing senior football only in 2009 and won back-to-back promotions to reach their current perch in Northern League Division One, created chances throughout an absorbing game but could not force an equaliser, as centre-back Baboucarr Jarra twice made goal-saving interventions for Thatcham."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eec18bbb6853c48ad9bc66e9c14177df2544361b/0_1732_2686_1612/master/2686.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1260146060db5c7aa92f6cbe684307be","title":"nation of shoplifters supermarket self checkout","story":"You’re not a thief, are you? Perish the thought. But when it comes to self-checkout tills anyone can make a ‘mistake’A couple of Tuesdays ago, after a difficult day at work, a thing that happens to me more often than I’d usually care to admit happened once again. At a supermarket self-checkout machine a frozen pizza I tried to swipe wouldn’t register, leaving me irked and full of spite. As a kind of reproach, I prepared to bag the item in any case, but a pang of weary guilt set in. Two choices sprung to mind. Carry on as though nothing untoward had happened, and knowingly steal. Or hail the cashier, who at the time was busy at another till, to fix the machine and right the wrong.I picked the second option, eventually. Though, to be honest, on another day I might have swayed the other way. Plenty of us do. Need proof? Look online, perhaps at a Reddit thread, and you’ll find anecdotes of petty self-checkout theft delivered with something like a stick-it-to-the-man pride. Expensive grapes are scanned as inexpensive carrots. Prime steaks are swiped as potatoes. The barcodes of pricey objects – wine, beer, spirits, cosmetics – are deliberately obscured by stickers removed from significantly cheaper on-sale items. Some scams have names – “the banana trick” (steaks as potatoes), “the switcheroo” (cheap barcodes for pricey ones), “sweethearting” (when a checkout supervisor only pretends to scan an object before handing it to a loved one, gratis) – though there are so many techniques not all of them do.For an idea of how close to home the issue really is, try mentioning it to your friends, like I did. Several of mine confessed to pilfering something from a self-checkout machine at some point, though nearly all of those added a caveat: only small stuff. One recently got away with an umbrella. “Must have forgotten to swipe it through,” she said. Another regularly declares chocolate croissants as bread rolls. And more than a few said they bagged items that failed to scan, half-shifting the blame on to a faulty machine. “A couple of times I tried exotic fruits as potatoes,” a friend wrote in a text one morning. “But a checkout lady once caught me with mangoes, very embarrassing, and I didn’t do it much after that.” He ended the message with an Emoji of a face beneath a halo. “Now I’m a saint, although sometimes I’ll take a five-pence bag if I’ve already paid and realise I need extra.” In a WhatsApp message, one friend confessed to regularly placing a single banana on the scales while nabbing an entire bunch, though that wasn’t all. Sometimes he fills the bagging area “so there’s no room left for more shopping and I’m forced to put items on the floor,” which circumvents the “unexpected item” message we all dread. “I really like the game,” he said. “It’s about being crafty, sneaky – and outwitting them.”When they turned up last decade, self-checkout machines were supposed to represent a new dawn in minimum-fuss shopping, though they’d been around since 1984. The till’s inventor, David R Humble, had introduced the technology at an LA trade convention, describing it at the time as “a revolutionary product” that “will sweep all of retail”. (To hammer home the point, he had an 11-year-old provide a demonstration. “Many marvelled,” the Los Angeles Times reported.) When they reached stores, the machines offered customers unexpected levels of autonomy, and the opportunity to avoid long queues at traditional checkout tills. And though the machines were outwardly advertised as being strictly beneficial for the customer, they offered retailers perks, too, notably the freedom to slash labour costs. The more self-checkout machines a supermarket had, the fewer cashiers it required. There were savings to be made.But any financial gains now appear to be marginal, at least in part due to unforeseen spikes in self-scanning theft. In a recent study a team at Voucher Codes Pro, a sales coupon website, quizzed 2,532 shoppers about their supermarket habits and found that close to a quarter had committed theft at a self-checkout machine at least once. (A figure from the same report suggested that the total cost of items stolen through self-checkout machines in 2017 came in at more than £3bn, up from £1.6bn in 2014, though the numbers are speculative.) Some steal by accident, the study found, perhaps on account of a scanning error – honest mistakes. But many perpetrators know exactly what they’re doing.In 2016, criminologists at the University of Leicester published a paper that reported on the impact of recent developments in mobile-scanning technology. The study was led by Adrian Beck, an emeritus professor of criminology, who has spent more than 25 years researching losses in the retail industry. In the report, he’d suggested that retailers who rely on self-scanning technology inadvertently create environments that encourage theft. In the self-checkout aisle, for example, human interaction is often pared back to a minimum, which reduces the perception of risk on the part of a potential perpetrator. “It’s about the degree of opportunity it provides people who wouldn’t normally do something deviant,” explains Beck. “It presents them with opportunities they wouldn’t normally have.”As Beck sees it, the customer who reaches the self-checkout machine and knowingly bags a frozen pizza after it fails to register isn’t a typical thief. “This guy didn’t get out of bed that morning and say, ‘I can’t wait to be a shoplifter today,’” Beck told me. “And he didn’t walk down an aisle and put something in his pocket.” In most cases, perpetrators are otherwise honest. They tend not to employ traditional shoplifting techniques, and are unlikely to steal in circumstances in which an opportunity is not presented to them. Psychologists call this Opportunity Theory – when an offender consciously decides to take advantage of an opportunity for crime that has appeared in his normal routine. But there is other psychology at play, too. Often, perpetrators will construct what they perceive as legitimate excuses for theft. Some feel justified in taking items when the checkout machine they’re using doesn’t operate smoothly (it’s the machine’s fault). Others consider the items they steal as a kind of payment for work they’re completing on the supermarket’s behalf.Still more reach the self-checkout machine, look around, and see nothing but the inhuman trappings of a faceless corporation. Few would steal from an inidual grocer. But from a multinational conglomerate? What difference does it make? “There’s a mountain of good socio-cognitive criminological research that explains this under the heading of Neutralisation Theory,” says Shadd Maruna, a criminology professor at the University of Manchester. I’d asked him to take me through the psychology of self-checkout theft, to help me get to grips with the “why”. “Iniduals can neutralise guilt they might otherwise feel when stealing by telling themselves that there are no victims of the crime, no human being is actually being hurt by this, only some mega-corporation that can surely afford the loss of a few quid. In fact, the corporation has saved so much money by laying off all its cashiers that it is almost morally necessary to steal from them.”Maruna offered a personal example to illustrate the point. “Twice in the past month I have handed back change to a cashier when I was given too much,” he said. “I did this because I was worried that the inidual, working for minimum wage, would have the money taken out of their own pocket if the cash till was short at the end of the workday. Had the same thing happened and a machine gave me the wrong change, there’s no question I would have pocketed it.” He finished with a flourish: “Screw them!”When I asked several supermarkets to comment on this story, they all declined. Later, when I visited a few of my local stores and asked cashiers about their experiences, most seemed initially open to revealing all before loyalty (or self-preservation) led them to pass the request up the chain to their shift managers, who each delivered a variant of the same message: “Ask head office.” Supermarkets, it seems, would prefer not to spill the beans.Which isn’t unwise. The subject is fraught with uncertainty. Often it is difficult for retailers to discern between malicious actions and honest mistakes – was the customer absent-minded or consciously fraudulent? – and proving intent can be perilous. Charge an honest shopper with theft and lose their business. Let a perpetrator off the hook and suffer a reduction in profit. Beck describes the scenario as “a legal and customer relations minefield”.Still, supermarkets are persevering with self-checkouts. According to a BBC report, by 2021 there will be 468,000 around the world, up from some 240,000 in 2016. And retailers aren’t stopping there. Amazon is pursuing plans to create stores in which checkouts are eradicated entirely. Computer vision and artificial intelligence will align to keep track of the items in a shopper’s basket, allow them to walk in and out of the store without any human interaction, and later email them a receipt and charge their account. Chinese retailers aren’t far behind.Soon, supermarkets might be entirely human-free – what they refer to in the industry as “frictionless”.Where will that leave us? Customer convenience will rise. The conflicts we sometimes face on a shopping run will reduce to faded memories, and long till queues will be vanquished. So, too, will staff. Cashiers will be erted to different sections of our stores, ostensibly to better help customers mid-shop, until they will disappear altogether, along with human interaction, the one thing that seems to keep us on the straight and narrow.

They see everything in cake. Or on a cake. “It does consume you” says Brisbane cake artist Zoe Byer, “you can’t really turn it off.”It is like going through a portal into another dimension. A delicious world of weirdness, spun from sugar. A place where “everything is cake all the time” says Scottish master baker Paul Bradford, “it doesn’t matter where you go or if you are on holiday. You see a bouquet of flowers and think that would look good on a cake.”Bradford is one of about 400 “cakers” who have converged on Brisbane this weekend for the International Cake Show 2018, also known as the cake Oscars.Cakers at this level are consummate professionals. What was once the domain of grandmothers and great aunts is now serious business, a huge industry. Bradford’s online cake decorating school has 180,000 members from every country on earth. “It is Netflix for cakes”. In the cake world an orchid is not just an orchid. On a cake it can’t be too chunky and it can’t be too thin. “It has to look natural and not too handmade looking,” says the amiable Scot.Above all it has to look good on Instagram. The rise of reality television shows like Cake Wars and The Great Australian Bake Off have seen people rushing back to the kitchen, after the domestic arts skipped a generation or two.“The more technology takes over the more hungry we are to get our hands back into baking” says Karen Portaleo, an American cake artist superstar who is at the show. “It is a very new world that is ever changing. It is also being completely reimagined to levels that have never existed before.”Indeed some of the cakes in competition at the show seem to to be more about engineering than the icing hastily covering the lumpy mistakes of Grandma. Weeks and months of painstaking work and planning have gone into some of the sculptural marvels on display. This, says Byers is “an art form. “it is not ladies making a frilly cake with a flower or a bow on it. It is about how far you can push things.”The cakes have been flown in from all points of the globe, often on their own plane seat. There can’t be much worse for a caker than having your cake go splat on the way to the show, even though there is a cake hospital for such emergencies. There are tiers and tiers on flower strewn wedding cakes, enchanted forests, gardens, animals, gravity defying flying figurines. One, a large chimpanzee in a dress seem to have a motor inside it that turned its head from side to side. On the day before the show opened there was a hushed, tense atmosphere as judges in white coats hunched over the cakes, peering and murmuring over every detail. Winning an international award is priceless if you have a cake business, but while Bradford concedes it can be competitive and “cut throat”, no one has stabbed anyone else with a cake knife so far.He does, however, know a Spanish woman who once smashed her cake on to the floor during a competition because she didn’t think it was perfect.A pastry chef who has been decorating cakes for 40 years, Greg Cleary is one of the judges. “You want visual impact, presentation, balance, proportion, design, covering skills. The covering of the cake has to be beautiful and smooth and neat. You want the execution of skills.” Bradford agrees. “They don’t want to see someone who has a good technique but just repeats it over the whole cake. You need to incorporate a lot of different techniques without it looking over the top.”But you have to get your fundamentals right first. No amount of artistry with icing will help if your cake crumbles. “You have to get the inside of the cake correct. A lot of people spend more time on the construction of the cake than the decoration.” You can’t just decide to do a five-tier wedding cake before you have mastered your humble sponge. “You’ve got to start with Victoria sponge then work your way up to chocolate and toffee cake.”When Bradford first announced his vocation it couldn’t have been less cool. “It’s a very sad story. I used to bake with Gran at weekends. When I was at primary school we had the class talk about what you wanted to be when you got older. Everyone wanted to be a astronauts and policemen. I wanted to be a cake maker.”He went on to own five cakes shops in Scotland and bake cakes for the Queen when she was at Balmoral. (Her favourite was a lemon drizzle with white chocolate ganache.) “They were personal cakes not public ones. Some were really funny. When the Royal Yacht Britannia was decommissioned we thought they can’t afford a boat anymore, so we did the Royal family in a rowing boat with the Queen rowing and the little corgis and Princess Anne with her hair.” Unfortunately the Queen could not be seen to be rowing a boat so he had to put a page boy there instead.When he did a cake for Prince Albert for the tennis open, the butler gave him a tour of the palace. “We were drinking champagne, even the staff were having a little drink.”Footballers are big on cakes. “I have done loads of footballs, football pitches, football shirts.”His last job before he sold his shops was a cake for lavish Indian wedding for 1000 people. “We did an eight foot tree with all these lovely branches and at the end of each branch were apples decorated with sparkles and glitter. Hundreds of apples and over 1000 chocolate leaves.” In the end, cakes are about celebration. About something special that is happening. “Those people that are cake decorators” says Byer, “are people that like to make other people happy. People don’t come to you to ask for a cake for the saddest day of their life, they are for birthdays and weddings. There is an art to making people happy, sharing joy through sugar and fondant. It is good for the soul.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/645971330f70bb364743e4cbefce1a9a23728a23/1185_1199_4502_2701/master/4502.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f22d67cb64ae67868b674b0ff79b7fcc","title":"nigel slater easygoing ready when you are salad recipes","story":"Flexible dishes, delicious as soon as they’re prepared, equally good after a restful pauseThe most useful of recipes are those that do not demand our punctuality at the table. They carry with them a sense of ease, allowing them to be eaten at our pace rather than theirs. So you can pounce on them the moment they are made (that spirit of urgency to tuck in), but they are also happy to sit for a little while without losing anything in terms of flavour or, perhaps more essentially, texture.I made two salads this week that fitted neatly around the sort of day we were having, where people came to the table at different times. Early birds got warm chicken fresh from the oven, tossed with a bright and citrussy dressing and fresh herbs the late arrivals got chicken that had time to rest with the shredded ginger, finely chopped chillies, lime and mint. The second salad was more calming: a collection of brassicas with a balm of goat’s curd and shallots, spiked with sweet-sour onions.The chicken salad was eaten outdoors, to be followed by a platter of piled-up vanilla ice cream with halved passion fruit tucked among it – little cups of apricot-coloured juice and black seeds to tip over the vanilla ice. There were sweet biscuits on the table, too, to crush at will and scatter over in a shower of sweet crumbs. A sort of last-minute assembly that can be made as someone decides to come to the table.The roasting juices form part of the dressing, but you could easily use cold chicken left from a Sunday roast, adding a little more dressing as necessary. If you are not eating this immediately, I would be tempted to add the coriander at the last minute.Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6. Put the thighs into a roasting tin, rub them generously with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and roast for 45 minutes or until the skin is crisp and the thighs’ juices run clear when pierced with a skewer.Peel the ginger and slice into matchsticks. Halve the chillies lengthways, de-seed if you wish, then slice finely. Peel and finely slice the garlic.Take the chicken from the oven, remove from the tin, then leave to rest for 10 minutes before tearing the flesh from the bones in large pieces and dropping them into a mixing bowl. Place the cooking juices in the tin over a moderate heat, add the ginger and garlic and let them colour to a warm, nutty brown. Add the sliced chilli for the last minute or so, then remove all from the heat.Stir the sesame oil into the ginger and chilli dressing, the Thai fish sauce and the rice wine vinegar. Squeeze the limes, stir the juice into the dressing then check the seasoning.In a dry, shallow pan, toast the sesame seeds until golden then add them to the dressing. Roughly tear the mint and coriander leaves and mix them with the chicken, then carefully fold together the chicken and the ginger dressing.If romanesco evades you, use the thin-stalked tenderstem or purple sprouting rather than double up on either of the others. The salad is best with an assortment of textures. As you lightly cook them, try not to overcrowd the pan.For the pickle:white wine vinegar coriander seeds 1 tspblack peppercorns 1 tsplemon juice of halfsalt 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tspred onion 1, medium romanesco 400gcauliflower 400gbroccoli 400golive oil 3 tbspFor the goat’s curd:banana shallot 1tarragon 30g of bushy stemsgoat’s curd 250gPour the vinegar into a pan and place over a moderate heat, then stir in the coriander seeds, peppercorns, lemon juice, salt and sugar. Peel the onion, then slice in half from root to tip. Separate the layers, then put them in a jar. As soon as the vinegar has come to the boil and the salt and sugar have dissolved, pour over the onion and tighten the lid. Set aside for 4 hours, turning the jar upside down from time to time.Bring a pan of water to the boil and salt it. Cut the brassicas into florets, discarding any thick stalks as you go. Cook the florets in the water for 3 or 4 minutes until they are just tender. Drain and refresh in a large bowl of iced water.Transfer the onions and their pickling liquor into a large serving bowl, then stir in the olive oil. Drain the brassicas, then add them to the bowl. Leave to settle for an hour.Peel the shallot, cut it in half from root to tip, then dice very finely and transfer to a small mixing bowl. Remove the tarragon leaves from their stems and roughly chop them, add them to the shallot, season with black pepper and then add the goat’s curd and fold gently together and chill. It can stay in the fridge until you are ready. Put the cauliflower and broccoli into a serving bowl then add the pickled onion rings and the dressing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fbca4eb44d53daa51275704820205a652fb74f38/0_1977_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e3f203d945756841760f8cbf23c7f45","title":"the dilapidated victorian house thats now indestructible","story":"Rebuilt and filled with reclaimed pieces, this family home in north-west London has been given a new lease of lifeFlora Bathurst is surveying her back garden with dismay: scattered on the lawn are a bright red robot, a Nerf gun, a toy trolley and a large plastic cash register. “I have tried to do my best to keep it under control,” she says. “But there is an inevitability to small people’s stuff.” Bathurst has lived with her husband and two young children in this terraced house in north-west London for just two and a half years, and already she feels the place is “silting up”.To the outsider, Bathurst’s home is an exquisite assemblage of design classics set against a considered selection of reclaimed materials, but at heart – both literally and figuratively – it’s a hard-working family home. Bathurst, who is a director of photography (and Elle Decoration alumnus), worked with the architect Anthi Grapsa to conquer and corral the toys. The solution is twofold: a corridor of cupboards and a handsome utility room. “I had to fight my husband, Andrew, for the utility room,” says Bathurst. “But knowing how much time I would end up in there doing washing. I wanted a proper space for that.”The four-bedroom, mid-Victorian property was in a dilapidated state when Bathurst received the keys. “It was like a dog that had been really badly beaten,” she recalls, “but I wasn’t going to take on anything that couldn’t be completely done over.” At one point, Bathurst was standing in the living room looking at the roof. “Eventually, the roof, the back and the side all had to come off. We were truly left with a shell.” Undaunted, she discovered the power of rolled steel joists and sliding pocket doors and, after 10 months’ planning and a 10-month build, a new floorplan emerged.The typical Victorian structure was reconfigured. Now, on entering the front door, a 2m-wide sliding door takes you into the living space and adjoining office. Along the right-hand side of the living room, the once gloomy corridor and staircase have been boxed in, creating a vast run of built-in storage that conceals “untold amounts of crap”. There’s also a downstairs loo, the walls covered in Fornasetti wallpaper (a perk from her Elle Deco days).Beyond the office space, another sliding door to the left leads to a beautiful utility room clad in reclaimed Welsh slate. Straight ahead is the open-plan kitchen and dining room, which can be shut off from the rest of the house by another pocket door. (“Useful if you’re having a late one with friends.”) On the first floor are three bedrooms, while the Farrow \u0026amp Ball Inchyra blue master bedroom – with an adjoining iroko and marble ensuite bathroom – was built into the eaves.Having reinvented the floorplan and rebuilt the framework of the house, Bathurst drew on the creativity of the wider Bathurst family for the interiors. (Her late mother was an interior designer, her elder sister, Bella, is an author, photographer and furniture maker, and her middle sister, Lucy, creates bespoke textiles.) Her own professional experience also guided the process. As photography director for Elle Deco, she spent her days editing images of exquisite homes. “What looked like me working hard was actually me doing research for my own house,” she says, wryly. “I was endlessly inspired by those houses and able to pinpoint what I liked and what I didn’t like.”Pinterest became a crucial resource for Bathurst, who accumulated hundreds of images, organising them by room. “You’ll notice that you keep referring back to the same one or two images – that becomes your edit,” she says. “Eventually, you’ll find something that is very applicable to yourself.”For Bathurst, specific material combinations began to emerge, such as slate with brass, and iroko with concrete. All along, the brief was to be “bullet proof”. The reclaimed pitch-pine floorboards that run throughout the ground floor have been treated with soap and lye, and coated in an impenetrable layer of matt varnish. Likewise, the reclaimed iroko tops in the kitchen and utility room are indestructible. The laminated birch-ply cupboards in the kitchen are wipe-downable, as is the black walnut dining table, which was made by her sister Bella, “and given about 20 coats of varnish”.The cushion covers that top the benches in the dining area were designed by Flora and her sister Lucy. The pattern represents the contours of the hills in Scotland where the sisters grew up. Since “small people don’t understand the concept of napkins until they are at least past six”, the cushion covers are removable and washable.Layered against this backdrop is Bathurst’s collection of black and white photography, which she has built up over the years. Above the fireplace is an image from Joseph Szabo’s Teenage series – a housewarming present to herself. “I have a Terry O’Neill of Pete and Dud that I’m very fond of, a Todd Hido, a Matt Black… And my mum was very generous and gave me a couple of pictures from the Atlas gallery. She had a pretty good idea about that sort of thing.”As for furniture, the only new items in the house are the beds everything else has been “resurrected”. The circular vintage Saarinen table was a gift from her sisters, while the matching Tulip chair came from her mother. The sheepskin rug in the living room was an eBay find, and both of the sofas are heirlooms that have been reupholstered.“I’m not a fan of the throwaway culture,” says Bathurst. “And I don’t mind if things are a bit baggy around the edges. You buy something, you wear the shit out of it, you patch it up, and wear the shit out of it again.”It’s a no-nonsense maxim that makes living with a combination of design classics and small people possible."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d2f39f58a82da28f2e63c71716e62c1ccd94532/0_0_3543_2439/master/3543.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f5bd0114b4b6da46cbb3224b33156a3 700w","title":"new uk law to rein in social media firms is couple of years away says minister","story":"Culture secretary says four out of 14 firms turned up when invited to discuss clampdownThe high-profile launch of a campaign to clamp down on social media firms has backfired, as the culture secretary, Matt Hancock, admitted it was likely to be two years before there was any new law.In a round of media interviews, Hancock said there was no date for legislation but it would be in the “next couple of years”, and he said he was launching a consultation document ahead of a white paper in the autumn.Hancock also admitted that when he called in representatives of 14 leading internet companies to discuss his ideas, only four turned up. “The fact that only four turned up gave me a big impetus to drive this legislation through,” he said. “Until now there’s been this argument: work with the companies, do it on a voluntary basis, you’ll do more that way because the lawyers won’t be involved.”Speaking on BBC1’s The Andrew Marr Show, hosted by Emma Barnett in Marr’s absence, Hancock said: “Having a level playing field is important. There’s no other field of life in the UK where we say these are international companies so we can’t legislate – so we will.”He said the new legislation would have the same scale of fines for failing to enforce anti-bullying or harassment rules as those in the data protection bill, which is due to become law in the next few weeks. For Google or Facebook that could mean fines of many millions of pounds.Hancock also wants to fine social media companies that fail to prevent under-13s from signing up for accounts. It is estimated that half of all children aged 11-13 are on Facebook or another social media platform.Challenged to explain how lower age limits could be enforced and what would trigger a fine, Hancock said it was a matter for broad consultation. In an interview with ITV’s Peston on Sunday, he suggested a parent might be required to verify a child’s age. “Asking for a parent to verify if someone is old enough is one of the things we are looking at,” he said.The government said last year it would introduce an internet-wide levy to fund measures to tackle online abuse. However, it now seems there will be a further round of consultation with the sector and charities before any decision is made on how to proceed.The difficulties of legislating in this field have been illustrated in Germany, where tough new laws on taking down hate speech have had to be reconsidered after complaints that too much content was being removed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7caa669da85cdc89b63e02092303b2e223ba09b/0_95_3387_2032/master/3387.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14541ca1e484ed2d02fa496017265909","title":"shigur idol shatters expert views birth of ritual art hunter gatherers","story":"Studies date Shigir Idol to 11,500 years ago – and cast new light on hunter-gatherers at the end of the ice ageOn 24 January 1894, gold prospectors were digging in the Shigir peat bog, north of the town of Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, when they uncovered a strange collection of carved pieces of wood.A total of 10 fragments were found beside each other. When put together, a wooden idol more than five metres high was created, one that had clearly been carved from a single, carefully smoothed plank of larch wood. Its surface was covered with zigzag lines and human faces and hands.This is the Shigir Idol, and according to scientists writing in Antiquity, recent studies of its structure and its date of construction dramatically overturn our ideas about the appearance of art among humans. The idol, it transpires, is one of the oldest pieces of monumental art ever uncovered.“Our analysis indicates that the Shigir Idol is around 11,500 years old,” said archaeologist Professor Thomas Terberger, of Göttingen University, in Germany, one of the authors of the Antiquity paper. “At that time, Europe and Asia were still emerging from the ice age. There were no farmers then. The only humans in this part of the world at this time were hunter-gatherers. Yet they created the Shigir Idol. The discovery of its antiquity therefore changes, dramatically, – our views about the birth of ritual art.”Many examples of early stone age are known: they include the cave paintings of France and Spain, created more than 30,000 years ago, and tiny objects, carved out of mammoth tusks, that depict animals or animal-human hybrids. Many of these are extremely delicate and extraordinarily well crafted. But they are generally realistic in style. The symbol-covered Shigir Idol represents a leap beyond this sort of naturalistic art.When the idol was discovered, the date of its construction was a matter of conjecture and remained so for a century until, in the 1990s, scientists removed a portion and used radiocarbon detectors to date it. It produced an age of about 9,800 years. any scholars rejected the result as implausible. Hunter-gatherers did not have the ability to make such a huge work or have the complex symbolic imagination to decorate it in the way that the idol has been adorned, sceptics argued.As a result, a new, more sophisticated dating was sought and the result of that work is outlined in Antiquity. These show that far from being a younger object than was suspected by the sceptics, the idol turns out to be even older than was indicated by the first dating attempt. “The result was quite a surprise, I admit,” said Terberger.In the past, large-scale complex art was considered to be the handiwork of later, sedentary farming people who started to spread from the Middle East about 8,000 years ago and took over land previously used by hunter-gatherers. These agrarian societies achieved considerable sophistication and were eventually responsible, in Britain, for the construction of great Neolithic works such as Stonehenge and the Ness of Brodgar in Orkney.By contrast, it was assumed hunter-gatherers were not capable of the type of symbolic thinking, nor the organisation, that underpinned the design of these great monuments. However, the dating of the Shigir Idol suggests this is not the case and that the period just after the last ice age was not a cultural desert as some experts have argued. The lack of remains of hunter-gatherer monumental art may simply be blamed on the fact that they used wood which has not survived – unlike the stone works of their farming folk successors. Only the freak conditions of the peat bog of Yekaterinburg permitted the idol’s survival.“We have to accept that hunter-gatherers had complex rituals and were capable of very sophisticated expression of ideas and art,” said Terberger. “These things didn’t start with farmers, they began with hunter-gatherers much earlier.”Analysis of wood from the idol has also revealed much about living conditions. “If you study the rings, you can see trees were growing very slowly as it was still pretty cold then. Europe was still emerging from the last ice age. You can see that in the rings of the wood that makes up the idol.”Over the years, archaeologists have dug up many small tools also decorated with zig-zag symbols in northern Europe, suggesting that society was much less fragmented than previously thought and that there was considerable sharing of ideas. Terberger said: “It is exciting to see these connections being established over huge distances.”But what was the purpose of a monument that would have loomed over any terrain in which it was erected? “From our current perspective, it is very hard to work out what was going on in the minds of the creators of the Shigir Idol,” Terberger said. “However, I am struck by the similarity of the idol with the totem poles of native Americans in the north-west Pacific region.” Such poles often honour gods or ancestors and this could explain the purpose of the idol.Other researchers suggest alternative theories. Mikhail Zhilin of the Russian Academy of Sciences – another of the paper’s authors – argues that the idol might depict forest sprites or demons while Vang Petersen, of the National Museum of Denmark, suggests that the carvings were “keep out” warnings not to stray on sacred land. “It’s intriguing,” Terberger says. “What is certain is that its makers were saying a lot more than just an announcement that ‘I can build a big pole.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9613eaafe8747efdf21e3c0db3991cdba9aa2d/27_105_2366_1420/master/2366.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13bdabeb2dc8a0934afe67542d1eeefc","title":"pakistan leicestershire tour match report","story":"With Pakistan getting ready for the first Test on Thursday, Azhar Ali believes they can take 20 England wickets at Lord’s.The opener, who hit 73 on Satuday, said: “Good bowlers always take advantage of early-summer conditions, and we have good bowlers.” He added: “That’s the way we’re thinking. We want to play attacking cricket, we want to take 20 wickets, that’s why we are going with five bowlers, and hopefully this side will do well.”Their main strike bowler, Mohammad Amir, was unavailable here, protecting the recurring knee injury which forced him to leave the field in the Test against Ireland last\u0026nbspweek.But the fact his fellow opening bowler Mohammad Abbas, who took nine wickets in the Test against Ireland, picked up a solitary victim deep into the evening session, while fellow seamers Rahat Ali and Faheem Ashraf both went wicketless, indicates that the pitch at Lord’s is going to have to have spice in it for there to be a serious possibility of Pakistan bowling England out twice.Accurate and economical they may have been, but penetrative they were not, and on a flattish track only the leg-spinner Shadab Khan looked able to make inroads.Ali also said Pakistan are likely to be unchanged from their Test victory near Dublin last week.But as preparations for their two-Test series against England go, taking three wickets in the first 72 overs against what amounted to a county second XI is unlikely to fill Pakistan with confidence. Yet Ali said: “Overall we’re happy with the preparation we’ve had and hopefully that will transfer to the Tests against England. Amir is fine, he bowled very well against Ireland and in the last couple of days he’s been doing his rehab and also some bowling and he’s quite comfortable.”On a cloudless morning it took the visitors almost an hour and three-quarters to prise out Leicestershire’s young openers, who had brought up the 50 before Shadab had Sam Evans leg before on the back foot for 22.Harry Dearden had ground his way to 19 off 77 balls when a loose drive at a wide delivery from Saad Ali gave Fakhar Zaman a low catch at backward point.That was the sum of Pakistan’s success before lunch, but they appeared more focused after the break. Ashraf bowled a lively, aggressive and accurate spell, during which he hit Ateeq Javid on the helmet, and Rahat also improved, but it was Shadab who caught the eye. The smiling teenager once again demonstrated the considerable potential of his variations, having Lewis Hill caught at mid-off and Aadil Ali dropped at cover, as well as a handful of respectable leg before shouts turned down, though Leicestershire’s batsmen later reported his googly can be picked, both from the hand and because it is bowled with a slightly quicker action.Even so, wickets continued to elude the visitors. Javid went on to a half-century before retiring, and the shadows of the floodlight pylons were extending a long way across the pitch before Abbas had Tom Wells caught in the gully. Even then Tom Taylor hit him for four fours in five balls before the players shook hands.“It’s a team game and everybody will have to play a part,” said Azhar. “As a senior player I need to make sure I do what I can to build a platform so we have enough runs on the board to help the bowlers. It’s never easy to play in England, it’s always challenging, but we are prepared to do our best. It’s a big opportunity, especially for the younger players.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25373960797fca4a450d9176a59d0513d54eef07/220_503_5175_3105/master/5175.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=71caf69972e51218b1ceb1373eb6a80e","title":"rapfael nadal alexander zverev italian open","story":"A year after Alexander Zverev announced his arrival in the big time by crushing Novak Djokovic to win the Italian Open, the young German held his own but not his crown as Rafael Nadal outlasted him to win his eighth title on the Campo Centrale, 6-1, 1-6, 6-3 in two hours and nine minutes with two rain breaks.When it was put to him that the rain was not his friend Zverev smiled and nodded. “No, it’s not. But it happens. Nothing you can do about it. He came out way faster, played way more aggressive than I did. It took me a long time to get activated again. I ran out of time. The break took my momentum away.”Asked how he might convert his good run of three-setters to the much different challenge of a slam, he said: “I will try to play the same way over a longer period of time. But I don’t even want to think about tennis the next few days, then to Paris, where Rafa will be the favourite, no doubt about it.”Ten years separate them in age, there is a gap of $90m in career earnings and the Spaniard now has 70 more titles than the 21-year-old world No\u0026nbsp3. But Zverev is here to stay. He is growing in power and confidence and, seeded second in Roger Federer’s absence, he will be a threat at the French Open, which starts on Sunday and where Nadal will reach for his 11th Coupe de Mousquetaires. They cannot meet until the final.On Sunday, a chasm that had looked unbridgeable shrank noticeably. Zverev has yet to beat Nadal in five attempts but he is getting closer. That was the fourth time in the six sets they had played on clay when Nadal had restricted Zverev to a single game in one frame – and the first time the German had returned the favour.The demands of winning seven best-of-five matches in a row is still a huge ask for Zverev – as it will be for Dominic Thiem, who stopped Nadal’s run of 50 clay sets in a row in Madrid 9 days ago, before losing in the final to Zverev.The rival most likely to stop Nadal at Roland Garros could still be the man he has played 51 times over 12 years, and whom he beat for the 25th time in the semi-final on Saturday. Djokovic provided an exhausting test of Nadal’s game from start to finish this was a stop-start skirmish, because of the elements and the efforts of the combatants.The sharpness the German showed in pushing Kyle Edmund deep and wide in their close third-round battle was not quite there in the early exchanges. He had to take risks he could get away with against lesser players. From there, errors crept into his game.He had been 40-love up in the sixth game when a lazy forehand handed Nadal another break opportunity and he cashed, in when a return popped up off the net, to go 5-1 up after half an hour. He served out the set, untroubled.The match was then turned on its head. Zverev put his heart and soul into a fightback and he finally got a look on Nadal’s serve in the second game and forced Nadal wide enough to overstretch on his forehand for the break.Zverev held to love and, in the space of a few minutes, the complexion of the contest changed from walkover to engaging theatre to potential upset.The fourth game was pivotal – in the match and possibly in Zverev’s season. He got overexcited when he dumped a forehand when trying to pass Nadal at the net for a 4-0 lead, then lobbed long. He outfoxed him in an exchange of drop shots to grab another break point – this time sealing it with a devastating backhand down the line. His fist-pump to his box screamed defiance and resolve.The match was taking on an eerie familiarity for Nadal. In Buenos Aires 13 years ago, he beat Gastón Gaudio 0-6, 6-0, 6-1. There would be no bagel – nobody has done that to him since Roger Federer in Hamburg nine years ago – but he could not stop Zverev wrapping up the set 6-1 with another unreachable backhand.Zverev played a drop-shot to engineer the break at the start of the final frame – and, as the rain arrived, he held for 2-0. The gathering – including most of Nadal’s family – took in a gasp of warm, moist air. For Zverev, impatient to finish the job, a 22-minute pause to let the showers pass was a minor irritant. For Nadal, it allowed him time to regroup and when they resumed ever so briefly in a light drizzle he held for 2-3. Again, the rain held up the royal progress.Nadal was asking the more searching questions. His whipped forehand was down from a tournament average of 193kph to 167kph, yet he still bossed the important exchanges with angles and timing.Trailing in the serving cycle, Zverev struggled to control his temperament and his opponent. Another attacking lob drifted long and Nadal finished the job with a backhand drop shot that not even the fleet-footed Zverev could reach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30d0ee918af039bd90f71d057266489bc644fac/0_124_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c0e7b2afbe24d2f51f0f49f68ff8cbc","title":"simon yates giro d italia stage 15 cycling","story":"Two days before the time trial which could prove a decisive moment in the 101st Giro d’Italia, Simon Yates took his third stage victory of the race at the Sappada ski resort on Sunday , extending his overall lead over the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, beyond the two-minute barrier. It was a massive step towards what could be a first British win in the Giro while the race favourite, Chris Froome, flopped badly following his stage victory on Saturday, with the overall win slipping further out of reach.With two short sharp climbs in the final kilometres and a further ascent to the finish, this stage finish favoured Yates’s punchy, attacking style more than the relentlessly steep slopes of Saturday’s finish on Monte Zoncolan. He made two incisive attacks in rapid succession at the foot of the penultimate ascent, Costalissoio the first pulled an elite group of half a dozen clear of the remnants of the lead peloton and the second took him clear for good.Yates decided to press on immediately after the rapid, chilly descent from the Passo di Sant’Antonio, which led straight up on to Costalissoio without giving the riders a pause to gather breath or stretch the legs. Froome was already floundering a little way behind as Yates’s team-mate Haig increased the pace, prompting the New Zealander Bennett to make a brief, unsuccessful attack.When the pink jersey had flown, Dumoulin was left in the company of four other contenders for the podium: Domenico Pozzovivo, Miguel Ángel López, Richard Carapaz and Thibaut Pinot. Only the Frenchman Pinot was willing to collaborate consistently with the Dutchman Dumoulin, who could be seen gesticulating at the quartet in an attempt to make them cooperate.Dumoulin was briefly dislodged by his four companions on the final ascent to the ski resort but regained contact when they began marking each other with their minds on the time bonuses awarded for second and third places behind Yates, whose stage victory looked assured from the moment he went past the five kilometres to go mark with 51sec in hand. The Dutchman ended the stage third, just behind López, but his loss of 47sec to Yates, including bonuses, extended his deficit to 2min 11sec.Stage 15 (Tolmezzo - Sappada 176km)\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 4hrs 37mins 56secs, 2 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 41s, 3 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb, 4 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida, 5 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team, 6 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ all at same time, 7 Alexandre Geniez (Fra) AG2R La Mondiale at 1m 20s, 8 Davide Formolo (Ita) Bora-Hansgrohe, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team, 10 Sam Oomen (Ned) Team Sunweb all at same time\u0026nbspGeneral classification after stage 15\u0026nbsp1 Simon Yates (Gbr) Mitchelton-Scott 65hrs 57mins 37secs, 2 Tom Dumoulin (Ned) Team Sunweb at 2mins 11secs, 3 Domenico Pozzovivo (Ita) Bahrain-Merida at 2m28s, 4 Thibaut Pinot (Fra) Groupama-FDJ at 2m37s, 5 Miguel Angel Lopez (Col) Astana Pro Team at 4m27s, 6 Richard Carapaz (Ecu) Movistar Team at same time, 7 Chris Froome (Gbr) Team Sky at 4m52s, 8 George Bennett (NZl) LottoNL-Jumbo at 5m34s, 9 Pello Bilbao (Spa) Astana Pro Team at 5m59s, 10 Patrick Konrad (Aut) Bora-Hansgrohe at 6m13s\u0026nbspAs for Froome, Yates had failed to overhaul the Team Sky leader in the final kilometres up Monte Zoncolan the previous day but 24 hours later Froome looked as if he had not recovered from that monumental stage-winning effort. At the finish the four times Tour de France winner had dropped from fifth overall to seventh but he is now 4min 52sec behind Yates, suggesting even a place on the podium may be out of reach.There are only six contenders for the podium in Rome on Sunday – seven counting Froome – and Yates’s stage victory puts him on a par with Eddy Merckx and the Italian Gilberto Simoni, the only others to have taken three stage wins while wearing the pink jersey. Those are not the key statistics for the Bury cyclist entering the final week, however.Dumoulin may well wipe out most if not all of that 2min 11sec in Tuesday’stomorrow’s time trial – he is the world champion at the discipline and the flat course will favour him – but the three mountain stages that follow it will give Yates the chance either to regain the lead or to reinforce it, depending on how things stand after Tuesday. The structure of this year’s Giro, with two time trials, one short and one longer if not over-long, means the tactical equation has always been simple: gain as much time on the specialists as possible.“It’s a good gap but he can take two minutes out of me in the time trial in one stage,” said Yates. “I’ve been fighting since Israel to get a good gap. I’m happy with the gap but it could vanish in 35 kilometres. I don’t know if it is enough.” His directeur sportif at Mitchelton-Scott, Matt White, put it differently: “We’re going to take a kicking from one of the best time triallists in the world.” The dimension of that kicking – if kicking it turns out to be – will go a long way to deciding the final outcome of this Giro."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2008/09/03/frankieboyle84.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8dbb5ab410aa1caad67a598514dd3f0","title":"frankie boyle israel joke bbc apology","story":"Frankie Boyle has accused the BBC Trust of cowardly behaviour after it apologised for a joke in which he compared Palestine to a cake being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew.Boyle said he had only learned of the rebuke from newspaper reports.The entire joke, which he made on the Radio 4 programme Political Animal, ran: I\u0027ve been studying Israeli army martial arts. I now know 16 ways to kick a Palestinian woman in the back. People think that the Middle East is very complex but I have an analogy that sums it up quite well. If you imagine that Palestine is a big cake, well … that cake is being punched to pieces by a very angry Jew.Following a complaint from a listener who said the comments were disgusting and antisemitic, the BBC Trust\u0027s editorial standards committee investigated and apologised. The committee said it endorsed the editorial complaints unit\u0027s finding about the use of the word Jew.It said: As a result, the committee wished to apologise to the complainant on behalf of the BBC for any offence the remark may have caused him and other listeners to the programme.Boyle criticised the corporation\u0027s governing body for its actions. I think the problem here is that the show\u0027s producers will have thought that Israel, an aggressive, terrorist state with a nuclear arsenal, was an appropriate target for satire, he wrote.  The Trust\u0027s ruling is essentially a note from their line managers. It says that if you imagine that a state busily going about the destruction of an entire people is fair game, you are mistaken. Israel is out of bounds.Noting that the BBC had refused to broadcast a humanitarian appeal in 2009 to help the people of Gaza rebuild their homes, he added: It\u0027s tragic for such a great institution but it is now cravenly afraid of giving offence and vulnerable to any kind of well-drilled lobbying.

The Daily Show host dedicates a full 10 minutes to the event at the start of his set, and it’s high quality material given its presumably hasty composition. But then the nuptials of a mixed-race American and a member of the British royal family is meat and drink to Noah, a comic who majors in race and social mores across borders and who, as a South African, is no slouch on the imperial self-regard of Britain’s ruling class.His wedding material certainly delights the locals – even those of us who’ve spent the day in a republican huff. He delivers a great line about the event’s supposed ersity (“Let me tell you something: a black cellist cancels itself out”), before imagining how it would have unfolded had it really been “a black wedding”. Yes, these jokes trade in broad stereotypes, and midway through Noah’s show I began to weary of his “white people do this, black people do that” shtick. But, for now, his cheerful ribbing of the claims being made for this establishment beanfeast were a pleasure to submit to.It all serves as a fine launchpad for the section in which Noah teases Brits for saying “sorry” all the time (see what I mean about stereotypes?), then imagines whether we did so while colonising Africa. From there, he weighs different perspectives on the “battles” waged between Brits and Zulus, and roleplays the anxious moment when a freed slave is offered passage to his new life – but on a boat. The subject matter is gratifyingly substantial but scarcely seems so, such is the easy swing of Noah’s smiling comedy.Sometimes, it’s too smiling – or, at least, too slick. I found the middle section harder to love. There’s an extended routine about hitting children (ground well trodden by black standups), as Noah recalls beatings at his mother’s hands and the African practice (as he describes it) of blithely whacking other people’s kids, too. It has its moments, but I found Noah’s evident amusement at the practice a little offputting. Then there’s a long story about an “authentic Balinese experience” Noah had on a recent holiday. Not for the last time tonight, his story – about exploitative tourism and a snake-charming act gone wrong – is brilliantly told and completely unconvincing.Of course every word may be true, but there’s something about Noah’s smooth style and the neatness of the incidents he describes that ring a little inauthentic. The political material – there’s less than you might expect – can also feel trite. There’s a routine that’s starry-eyed about Barack Obama. Another, on gun control, takes potshots at an easy target – Trump’s proposal that teachers be armed. The jokes about the president’s border wall are better, particularly the emperor’s-new-clothes payoff, featuring a droll cameo from a troupe of Mexican mime artists.He ends strongly, with a section declaring sympathy for old racists and positing a novel relief strategy for them and another addressing the N-word and what it connotes to speakers of the Xhosa language. At his best – which is where he spends about half of tonight’s show – Noah’s laid-back optimism can take heavyweight subjects seriously, and still render them momentarily lighter than air."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/044ec2e6d6a599e9f6b56b53a0cfe9e465341bb4/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c81ee0a2369d3152c2b4f5df148ccce","title":"the star quality of new zealands great barrier island","story":"The off-grid island 90km off the coast of Auckland is a Dark Sky Sanctuary ideal for star gazing – and the views by day are heavenly tooI was glad I had such terrible jet lag. Wide awake at 3.30am with my nine-year-old daughter on our lodge balcony, I stared for hours at the most incredible night sky I’ve ever seen before the dawn slowly started to rub out the stars on the horizon and the multiple shooting stars faded away.We were going to my girlfriend’s big family reunion in Auckland, New Zealand, but when we found out that Great Barrier Island, just off the coast, had been recently awarded Dark Sky Sanctuary status – a typically remote area that has an “exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights” – we thought it would be the perfect place to unwind before our busy schedule. It’s the first island and only the fourth location in the world to achieve this (along with Chile’s Gabriela Mistral, the Cosmic Campground in New Mexico and Rainbow Bridge National Monument in Utah).After a 28-hour flight with two travel-sick children, our hearts sank when we saw the tiny twin engine 10-seater that was to take us the 90km across the Hauraki Gulf to Great Barrier. But we needn’t have worried. Whether it was the g-force of the ascent or the noise of the plane (we had to wear headsets), it put our three-year-old daughter instantly to sleep until we bumped down on the grass at Claris airport. Our first empty sick bag against all the odds… Things were looking up.Great Barrier is off-grid and the 950 people living there (though only about half permanently) rely on solar and wind energy, and bottled gas for cooking. There are no streetlights. There are no cash machines or banks. The police force comprises a husband and wife, and there’s one postie. It’s not just the lack of light but the lack of noise that’s so blissful on this unique and stunning little idyll. It was first discovered by East Polynesians about 700 years ago and the Maori name for the island is Aotea (canoe). Captain Cook gave the island its European name, because it acts as a barrier between the Pacific and the Hauraki Gulf.The climate here is subtropical like Auckland’s, but it’s windier and more rugged a beautiful wilderness with lush forests, glorious, unspoilt sandy beaches and plenty of bays and a few mountainous areas where there are good walking tracks among the wetlands and gorges, including the three-day Aotea Track. You can birdwatch, snorkel, surf and kayak. The best beaches are on the eastern side of the island where the surf is better, too. The sheltered western side is where you’ll find the best ing and boating. Lots of people come here for the fantastic fishing spots around the island – snapper, squid, cod. Like a lot of spots in New Zealand, there are dolphin and whale-watching trips and you might just catch sight of hammerhead sharks.It’s rare to find an island that really does feel undiscovered – but this is it. When one of my girlfriend’s relations, who comes here regularly, found out that we’d been, he whispered to us, only half-joking: “Shh – don’t tell anyone!” (He’s a former All Black, so I might be in a bit of bother.) The locals are a relaxed and friendly bunch – a lot of them told us that it’s like Waiheke Island (now in effect a suburb of Auckland) was in the 70s when it was a hippy commune and full of artists and people wanting to escape the city. Killing Joke’s Jaz Coleman lives on Great Barrier and Veronica Lake’s daughter, the artist Anae Swan, also lives here.Our guide for some of our stay was the inestimable Hilde Hoven, a dark sky ambassador who runs Good Heavens with Deborah Kilgallon and Orla Cumisky. They bring their 8in Dobsonian telescope, binoculars and beanbags (it’s hard work staring up wide-eyed in wonder without neck support) and, my elder daughter was glad to hear, hot chocolate to wherever you are on the island. “It’s odd but when the light readings were done,” said Hilde, explaining how the island was awarded its special status, “they found there was more light pollution on the northern side coming from Fiji, which is about 3,000km away, than Auckland to the south. It’s pretty dark!”Beginning their celestial PowerPoint demonstration using a green laser pointer, Hilda and Orla showed us the Messier 4 globular cluster with white dwarf stars, Saturn and its rings, the Southern Cross and the Milky Way, which stretched across the sky. My daughter was especially taken with Hilde’s recounting of the Maori myth of Māui’s fish hook to explain the shape of Scorpius. In the fable, Māui hauled the North Island of New Zealand (Te Ika-a-Māui, which means the Fish of Māui) from the bottom of the ocean with his hook.We stayed at Mount St Paul’s Estate, a luxurious lodge run by the genial Chris and Teara, both from Canada. Teara used to be a chef at the Langham in Auckland and so dinner, eaten around a huge circular kauri table (made of one of the most ancient trees in the world), was every bit as mouth-watering as you’d expect seared scallops with a wasabi pea purée and braised lamb shanks with a garlic and maple reduction. Tucking into pancakes on the wraparound verandah overlooking the pristine white sandy beach was a great way to start the day.Another highlight was an hour-long walk to Kaitoke hot pools in the centre of the island, through wetlands and a kānuka forest, where we spotted fern birds and fantails and whiled away a good hour sitting in the pools shaded from the heat by layers of delicate umbrella ferns.We also loved visiting the potter Sarah Harrison, who showed us round her studio at Shoal Bay harbour, and her many pots and jugs, plates and bowls and colourful mosaics. She also uses a lot of found materials in her work, such as her driftwood chairs. My elder daughter loved the gorgeous hidden mermaid pool at Medlands beach where the water is separated from the sea in a secluded rock pool. Other high points were the gnarly, ancient pohutukawa trees and the stunning panoramic views of Okiwi Basin and Whangapoua beach from the top of Windy Canyon, just a 10-minute hike through a gorge up some steep wooden steps on the eastern side of the island. Apparently the island council turned down Paul McCartney’s application to buy a property at Great Barrier because of the unwelcome attention he would have brought. You can see why he wanted to come here equally, the island knows exactly what kind of star watching it prefers.Chris and his family stayed at mountstpaulestate.co.nz, Great Barrier Island.

Comments are open on our series recap blog.We begin where we left off: with Offred – or June, as she is becoming once more – being bundled, pregnant, into a van and driven away. Into the darkness within, or else the light we don’t – and she doesn’t – know.Light is streaming through a metal grille when a viewing hatch is opened, but it is slammed shut again. Audible clues offer no comfort: shouting, dogs barking. On the soundtrack – used sparingly and so effectively – is the signature falling glissando of doom.The hope drains from June’s eyes. Elisabeth Moss can say more with her eyes and her face than most actors can with 1,000 words. It is 10 minutes before she makes her first utterance, but in that time she displays hope, dread, defiance, defeat and strength again. She says very little in the whole episode (mostly in the flashbacks), yet she is mesmerising.June is pulled out by guards with snarling dogs. She – and the other handmaids – are muzzled and herded along a tunnel. What hell is this where the dogs are not muzzled, but women are? Well, Gilead. Fenway Park, to be specific, home to the Boston Red Sox a place of recreation in happier times. Now? A place of execution. Like Afghanistan under the Taliban, Iran, Guinea in 2009, Chile after Pinochet’s coup in 1973 ... the death knell resonates with reality and with history.A massive scaffold has been erected and a row of nooses are lined up. One is placed over each handmaid’s head, as This Woman’s Work by Kate Bush is played. It is one of those moments in this show that somehow manage to find beauty in the darkest trauma.It turns out to be a mock execution, a lesson to be learned. Aunt Lydia (Ann Dowd on song) shows up with her interpretation of the Christian message and her instruction to love God. “Walk with him and fear him and cleave unto him and you shall obey his word and the word of his servants here on Earth.”Finally, June speaks, offering her own prayer – in her head, at least. “Our Father, who art in heaven. Seriously? What the actual fuck!” It is a moment to gasp for air – of levity, even – and a reminder that humanity still exists. Because the opening is about as intense a TV experience as it is possible to have. I felt it physically, a tightness in the stomach.And that is not the end of it. After the first flashback, to a decision by June and Luke to try for a second child, it is straight back to the nightmare of the present. Aunt Lydia has the handmaids kneeling in the rain, holding rocks out in front as punishment for refusing to stone Janine to death. Filmed from above, it is more beautifully choreographed horror. Janine, incidentally, is on her way to the Colonies. We – the series – will be going, too. And further back, before Gilead, to see how it came about.The first flashback is not all about love and the joy of further procreation. There are warning signs of what is to come. Taking the pill is not a woman’s decision Luke has to sign off on it. “It’s ridiculous,” he says, casually, before signing. Next time – if they had not decided to stop – he would probably have said nothing and signed. There it is, the creeping normalisation.In the next flashback, June is getting a hard time for not picking up her daughter from school the moment she felt ill … for having a job, basically abandoning her child and her duties for her selfish pursuits. In the final flashback, it has begun to kick off: shooting from the gallery in the Capitol building, an explosion in the White House. You are left wondering just how big a leap it is from the Handmaid’s Tale flashbacks to the actual present.It may have been best to leave the show at one season, with Margaret Atwood, open-ended, a hint of better things to come. And with no chance of it becoming diluted or losing the plot. But that was never going to happen – successful doesn’t walk away from an audience.This is next best, exploring not only forward, but backwards, looking at how it came about. No dilution or loss of plot yet, in an extraordinary first episode that will ring on in your nightmares like Aunt Lydia’s bell. Also, think about what has happened since the first series: #MeToo, mass shootings, you-know-who still in the White House, an abortion referendum in Ireland this week … dong, dong, dong, dong. It is not just Aunt Lydia’s bell that continues to chime. While The Handmaid’s Tale continues to be relevant, it needs to be told. Praise be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/644801ea47e2927631ab08b2622ce43d0b229d31/0_195_4207_2524/master/4207.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04ceee462871c0a2eaae4f81e7c10dec","title":"congress us elections 2018 women candidates","story":"As the primaries continue, hundreds of women eye seats in Washington – but activists say there’s ‘more work to do’Every once in a while, a voter approaches Amy McGrath, a first-time candidate for Congress in Kentucky and a retired Marines fighter pilot, to tell her they can’t support her. The reason? McGrath’s three young children need her at home.“I always point out that the incumbent who serves in the seat has young children the same ages as mine,” McGrath said, adding: “I can’t imagine they would say that if I was a man.”Exchanges like that are rare – especially in comparison with the number of women, moms and veterans who have embraced her campaign, she says – but they illustrate the challenges female candidates still face on the road to Washington, even as record numbers prepare to run. McGrath, a Democrat who hopes to win a six-way primary on Tuesday, is part of a trailblazing crop of women running for Congress this year, especially for seats in the House.There are 408 Democratic and Republican women still running for the House, compared with 167 in 2016 and 159 in 2014, according to the Center for American Women and Politics (CAWP) at Rutgers University.The wave of women running also have more erse backgrounds and résumés. Many, like McGrath, are newcomers, spurred by the rage of losing a presidential election to a candidate with a history of berating women and emboldened by the #MeToo reckoning against sexual assault and workplace harassment.“For years, women have had to walk this fine line between being capable and being likable,” said Erin Loos Cutraro, chief executive and co-founder of She Should Run, a nonpartisan organization that seeks to increase the number of women in elective office. “But with this massive groundswell we’re seeing women from all backgrounds run as themselves.”At least two women running for governor – Kelda Roys in Wisconsin and Krish Vignarajah in Maryland – have run ads featuring them breastfeeding while discussing their political platforms. Nadia Hashimi, running for Congress in Maryland, promised voters less “mansplaining”. And Sol Flores, who lost her bid for Congress in Illinois, shared her story of sexual abuse in a campaign ad, promising: “I’ll fight as hard for you in Congress as I did to protect myself.”“It feels like we have this support system in women running across the country,” said Liuba Grechen Shirley, a first-time Democratic candidate for Congress in New York.This month, Grechen Shirley, the mother of two young children, won approval from the Federal Election Commission to use campaign funds for childcare. Two dozen members of Congress and Hillary Clinton sent letters of support for her request.“This ruling will allow more women – and men – to run for office,” she said, adding: “Our babysitter is a staff member in the same way that our field director and finance manager are staff members.”As women storm the ramparts of the Democratic party, female Republican candidates are fewer in number. Of the 408 women still running for the House, 305 are Democrats and 103 are Republicans, according to CAWP.Even so, Republicans boast an impressive and unusually large field of female hopefuls, said Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for Winning for Women, a new organization that aims to be the conservative counterweight to Emily’s List.“Our goal is to build lasting momentum that’s not just contained to a year,” Bozek said. “We want to see a lot of ‘years of the woman’.”She noted that the top two Republican fundraisers last quarter were women: Marsha Blackburn, running for Senate in Tennessee, and Martha McSally, running for Senate in Arizona. The only two women elected to Congress since Donald Trump took office have been Republicans: Karen Handel in Georgia and Debbie Lesko in Arizona.“Let’s absolutely celebrate the women who are on the ballot but let’s also look at who’s not there,” Cutraro said, noting a lack of Republicans and people of color. “This is just the beginning – we still have so much more work to do.”The results of the early primaries show that women aren’t just running – they’re winning.More than 50 women filed to run in Texas. Nearly half of the candidates who finished first in the Democratic primaries there were women, including two Latinas who are likely to head to Congress in November. In Nebraska, Kara Eastman bested a former congressman to win a primary to represent a congressional district in Omaha. Meanwhile, the Democrat Jane Raybould will face off against the Republican senator Deb Fischer in one of several general election races featuring or likely to feature two women.Pennsylvania, a state with an all-male congressional delegation of 20, stands out as a particularly bright spot. Last Tuesday, voters selected female candidates in seven primaries held in the state’s newly redrawn congressional map, three in districts favorable to Democrats.But for all the enthusiasm and energy, political observers warn it is too early to declare 2018 a “year of the woman”. “We’re really hopeful that we’ll see gains for women in November,” said Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at CAWP. “But we’re being careful about the extent to which this wave of women running will translate into a tsunami of women winning in November.”The route to Washington is complicated by several factors, Dittmar said. More Democratic men are running, too, which means primary races are crowded. Plenty of Democratic women are running in the same districts as each other, such as in Texas, where a handful of races featured as many as three female candidates. This means that women will be eliminated in the primaries.Perhaps the biggest hurdle for women this election cycle is that many are running against incumbents, who almost always win re-election. More than half of the female candidates running for House and Senate hope to unseat sitting members of Congress. Ten states have held primaries so far. Of the 125 women running for the House in those races, nearly half – 60 – have won, according to CAWP. But a significant number of Democratic primary winners will go on to face incumbents in safely Republican districts. Even if 2018 falls short of being a historic “year of the woman”, the wave of female candidates has already changed attitudes to running, organizers say.For decades, organizations like Emily’s List, the fundraising juggernaut dedicated to electing Democratic women who support abortion rights, have tried to narrow a so-called ambition gap by encouraging women to run for office and providing the resources to do it. Traditionally, those conversations require a degree of coaxing. But since the 2016 election, the phones have been ringing with women putting themselves forward.“What’s so inspiring is that we have so many women who have crossed over that first obstacle: desire to run,” Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily’s List, told reporters at the group’s national conference earlier this month. “Once that seed is planted, it doesn’t stop growing.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d0edabeeafb4017e0c94ac8339f32bd63fd5a88/0_445_772_463/master/772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9086f74e9a71124778ddf2e3ea6310e1","title":"chelsea owner roman abramovich is without a uk visa","story":"Russian billionaire’s visa ran out weeks ago and it is unclear whether he will get a new oneRoman Abramovich’s UK visa has expired and British authorities have not yet issued him with a new one, according to Russian media reports and people who know the businessman.The Russian oligarch and owner of Chelsea football club, who is the 13th richest person in Britain with a net worth of £9.3bn, according to the Sunday Times, held an entrepreneurial visa to the UK that expired several weeks ago. He has filed for a new visa, but has not yet been granted one, and it is not clear if or when he will be.Abramovich was not seen at Saturday’s FA Cup final at Wembley, which ended in a 1-0 victory for Chelsea over Manchester United.A person who knows Abramovich said he had not been denied a visa, but that it was taking longer than usual to renew and it was unclear why.A representative for Abramovich declined to comment on the reports, calling it a personal matter. Anglo-Russian relations have been strained since the double poisoning of the former Russian secret agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury in March. The UK expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the country in March, leading to a tit-for-tat expulsion by Russia later that month.Russia shut down the activities of the British Council, which promotes cultural programmes between the two countries, and Britain’s consulate-general in St Petersburg. The prime minister, Theresa May, also said the government would look more closely at Russian investments in the UK.The home secretary, Amber Rudd, said in March that the government would look retrospectively at Tier 1 visas, those given to applicants who want to open businesses in Britain and have at least £50,000 in investment funds, like the one Abramovich held. Nearly 700 Russians came to Britain between 2008 and 2015 on such visas.The delay in Abramovich’s visa was first reported by the Russian news agency the Bell, which wrote on Sunday that it had expired three weeks ago and that his private Boeing 767 last travelled to London on 1 April. The report cited three people who know Abramovich.A second person who knows him told the  the report “looked correct”, but emphasised that the Russian businessman had not yet received a firm answer from British authorities.The UK security minister Ben Wallace said: “We do no routinely comment on inidual cases.”Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and has helped bankroll the club during a period of unprecedented success, including five league titles. He regularly attends the club’s matches at Wembley and was seen at previous cup finals.Once considered Russia’s richest man, he said in a British court in 2011 that he had an extravagant lifestyle, including properties in London and France and the luxury 533ft super-yacht Eclipse.The Russian, who does not hold UK residency, owns a £90m home in Kensington Palace Gardens, nicknamed Billionaires’ Row.He owns Evraz, Russia’s largest steelmaker, and the metals producer Norilsk Nickel. He made his fortune in the 1990s in oil and gas in a period when state assets were privatised and sold off to a number of businessmen who made fantastic fortunes. Abramovich sold his stake in the oil firm Sibneft to the state-controlled gas group Gazprom for £7.4bn in 2005, increasing the Kremlin’s control over the country’s energy assets.His stake in the company became the subject of a £2bn lawsuit in a British court. Boris Berezovsky, a once-powerful businessman who lived in self-imposed exile under Putin, sued Abramovich in 2008 over claims that he was forced to sell his shares in Sibneft under the threat of violence. Berezovsky lost the case in 2012.While Berezovsky fell foul of the Kremlin under Vladimir Putin, Abramovich has maintained good relations with the Russian government. He served as governor, and then as the chair of the legislature in the remote Russian region of Chukotka. He helped build infrastructure at the 2014 Sochi Olympics that became an important prestige project for the Kremlin.A judge in the Berezovsky lawsuit ruling said that while Abramovich “enjoyed very good relations with Putin and others in power at the Kremlin”, he did not have enough influence to “pull the presidential strings”.He was named on a list of Russian oligarchs supposedly linked to Putin released by the US Treasury Department earlier this year. But the list was ridiculed as a carbon copy of the Forbes list of all Russians worth more than $1bn.

God made you like this and loves you like this and I don’t care. The pope loves you like this. You have to be happy with who you are,’” Cruz told Spanish newspaper El País. Now 87, Fernando Karadima, the man who abused Cruz, was found guilty of abuse by the Vatican in 2011.Greg Burke, the Vatican’s chief spokesman, did not respond to questions about whether Cruz’s statement accurately reflected his conversation with the pope.It is not the first time it has been suggested Francis has an open and tolerant attitude toward homosexuality, despite the Catholic church’s teaching that gay sex – and all sex outside of heterosexual marriage – is a sin. In July 2013, in response to a reporter’s question about the existence of an alleged “gay lobby” within the Vatican, Francis said: “Who am I to judge?”The new remarks appear to go much further in embracing homosexuality as a sexual orientation that is designed and bestowed by God. It suggests that Francis does not believe that iniduals choose to be gay or lesbian, as some religious conservatives argue.Austen Ivereigh, who has written a biography of the pope, said Francis had likely made similar comments in private in the past, when he served as a spiritual director to gay people in Buenos Aires, but that Cruz’s public discussion of his conversation with Francis represented the most “forceful” remarks on the subject since 2013.It did not, however, represent a shift in church teaching, Ivereigh said, since the church had never formally made any pronouncements on why iniduals were gay.Christopher Lamb, the Vatican correspondent for the Tablet, said the comments were remarkable and a sign of a shift in attitudes taking place. “It goes beyond ‘who am I to judge?’ to ‘you are loved by God,’” said Lamb. “I don’t think he has changed church teaching but he’s demonstrating an affirmation of gay Catholics, something that has been missing over the years in Rome.”The remarks come as several high profile members of the clergy have sought to publicly make inroads with gay Catholics, many of whom have felt shunned and unwelcome in the church and have been ostracised. Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest in New York who has nearly 200,000 Twitter followers, has led the outreach effort and was chosen last month to serve as a consultor to the Vatican’s secretariat for communications.Martin has argued in his book Building a Bridge that the onus is on the church to make LGBT Catholics feel welcome in the church and to stop discriminating against people based on their “sexual morality”.

Relations between Moscow and London are at their coolest since the cold war and the recent events in Salisbury even led to brief speculation (aided by Boris Johnson) that England could skip the tournament, recalling the Olympics boycotts of the 1980s.While inidual matches such as the United States and Iran’s face-off in 1998 were political lightning rods in their time, the host country has not faced such heated criticism perhaps since the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, held just two years after a right-wing military coup backed by the United States.Last week Human Rights Watch released a 44-page guide detailing repression and discrimination in Russia, targeted at the thousands of journalists expected to arrive in the country for the tournament.“Fifa still has time to show that it is ready to use its leverage with the Russian government to fulfil its own human rights policies,” Hugh Williamson of Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.Russia’s aspirations have changed since it was awarded the World Cup back in 2010. Then, it still appeared set on wooing the international community by holding prestige tournaments. Dmitry Medvedev was president and the reset in relations initiated by President Obama was still on track, with the goal of repairing relations after the war in Georgia. But even then, long before Salisbury, the war in Ukraine, laws against “gay propaganda” and hooligan violence in Marseilles, racist incidents in Russian football were a clear concern.Russian officials, as well as some players and journalists, insist that while the country has a problem with rightwing fans, the situation has been blown out of proportion by the press and is no worse than elsewhere in eastern Europe. The government says it has made advances in anti-racism monitoring at matches data from independent organisations appears to support that conclusion.But with monkey chants heard at three matches since March, the spotlight will remain on the hooligan culture, largely modelled on English fans, that has grown around post-Soviet football.A critical moment in that history came just four days after Russia was awarded the World Cup in 2010, when a Spartak Moscow fan named Egor Sviridov was killed by a rubber bullet during a brawl that pitted young, ethnically Russian football fans against youths from the country’s North Caucasus. The release of the suspected killer, Aslan Cherkesov, angered nationalists. Within days, thousands of football hooligans and far-right groups were rioting on Manezh square, beside the Kremlin, in nationalist-tinged protests that took nearly everyone by surprise.Vladimir Putin laid flowers at Sviridov’s grave later that month in what was interpreted as a sign of deference to nationalists. “It was one of the showcase events where everyone saw the numbers, the power the fans have, and the prevalence of the far-right ideology among the fans,” said Pavel Klymenko, who helps monitor instances of fan discrimination for the Football Against Racism in Europe (Fare) network. “There was a political importance too. Putin did not condemn them. He gave in to some of the xenophobic demands of the fans. His concern was for the fans not to turn against him.”The following years saw a number of ugly incidents. Several black players, including Emmanuel Frimpong and Christopher Samba, were punished by the Russian Football Union after reacting to racist slurs hurled by fans. Ultras in St Petersburg in 2012 released a manifesto demanding their team refuse to sign non-white and gay players. And CSKA Moscow were forced to play two games in an empty stadium after hooligans set off flares and unfurled racist banners during a Champions League fixture against Roma in 2014.The ban was “the point of no return” for Robert Ustian, a 34-year-old political analyst and CSKA fan, who founded a group called CSKA Fans Against Racism.The volunteer organisation seeks to change the club’s fan culture through better education and self-policing, and Ustian believes it has helped reduce racist behaviour at matches. He helps to organise monitoring of extremist slogans and banners, including swastikas, at matches. He has received threats, he said. Many other volunteers choose to remain anonymous. “Somebody has to stand up and raise his voice against this,” he said.Russian football has taken some important steps to combat racism, Klymenko said, including the appointment of the retired Chelsea and Fulham midfielder Alexei Smertin as a dedicated envoy against discrimination in Russian football, and improved monitoring at matches. In contrast, the government in 2013 passed new legislation outlawing “gay propaganda,” including gay pride parades or support groups for young people, which led to an upsurge in homophobic attacks. The new laws were a source of controversy before the 2014 Sochi Olympics and Klymenko said that homophobic language has been used at Russian football stadiums this season but little has been done to combat it. “Homosexuality is such a taboo in Russian society that nobody really dares to address it,” he said.Of criticism over race incidents, Igor Rabiner, one of the country’s best-known football writers said, “Sometimes it’s fair, sometimes it’s much exaggerated. Much work has been done to stop it, but you couldn’t eliminate it all. First, it takes time. Second, football just reflects what happens in society in general.”In a report in 2015, Fare and the anti-extremist Sova centre in Moscow documented 99 racist and far-right displays and 21 racially motivated attacks by fans during the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons.In a report to be released this week, Klymenko said Fare will announce a reduced incidence of racist symbols at matches, continuing a trend over the past several years. He said incidents of recorded racist slogans, such as monkey chants, have risen, but that is likely due to the increased monitoring at matches.But incidents have still come at critical moments. In March, France’s Ousmane Dembélé, N’Golo Kanté and Paul Pogba were targeted with monkey chants during a friendly in St Petersburg. Fifa this month fined the Russian Football Union more than £22,000 for the incident.Klymenko said the audience for that match would likely reflect that for the World Cup. “The problem is that young people come and see the dominance of the far-right chants, and anyone who tries to challenge has a significant threat of violence,” he said. “They’re soaking in the culture around them.”At the Russian Cup final in Volgograd this month, officials said violent fan behaviour would not be tolerated. Andrey Bocharov, the region’s governor, said that “all measures necessary are being taken” to protect fans, including banning fans known for violent or racist behaviour from the stadiums.Most attention appears focused on preventing fan violence or a terrorist attack: during the match, streets and public transport were blocked off for kilometres around Volgograd’s stadium.Hanging out at the game were players from Germany’s under-18 squad. “They’ve all wanted to take pictures with us,” German defender Yann-Aurel Bisseck, who is black, said, adding that many Russians around town even recognised him. That had followed an emotional game against the Russian under-18 squad held around the anniversary of the Nazi surrender in 1945. “Our coaching staff told us ‘you’re not only here for football.’ We were very happy to represent Germany.”Meanwhile, fans of the clubs Avangard and Tosno streamed into the stadium. A Tosno fan named Andrey Rylkov told the Observer that concerns over monkey chants were overblown: “It’s just some of the guys having a bit of fun,” he said. “I know people where you are from tend to take everything seriously, it’s a different culture… but we don’t believe in political correctness like that here.” Andrew RothAndrew Roth is the Observer Russia correspondentWe should be used to the revolving biennial spectacle of the stadium-building binges that accompany global sporting events – Olympics, World Cup, Olympics, World Cup, with the Winter Olympics thrown in for added drama. With them come recurring stories: geometrically increasing budgets, the suspenseful fear that they won’t be finished on time, picturesque malfunctions, the endless promise of “legacy”. This time, we are promised, the event won’t bequeath rattling, crowd-starved behemoths. Almost always, it does. Russia, where several of the grounds will go on to serve lower-league clubs in small-ish cities, doesn’t seem likely to buck the trend.There tends in these sporting extravaganzas to be a scent of corruption ranging from the faint whiff of distant flatulence to the rank, ripe stench of sharing a Dutch oven with a bean-eating petomane. Russia, to no one’s surprise, is at the latter end of the scale: according to Transparency International the cost overruns of this year’s World Cup – twice the cost per spectator of Brazil in 2014 – are at a scale that can only be explained by corruption. To which sorry tales can be added the dark stories that Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 have brought to prominence, of the use of near-slaves (from North Korea in Russia’s case) to build the stadiums.All of which might make the mere look of these structures seem secondary. But, given the money, energy, materials and labour that have gone into them, the fact that they will be landmarks in their cities for decades and that billions will see them on TV, it is not insignificant.There is a limited range of known ways of designing stadiums, as their basic shapes tend to be pushed towards uniformity by consistent and demanding parameters. There is the swooping roof, often hung on wires and masts, as in Frei Otto’s tent-like stadium for the 1972 Munich Olympics. There is the backlit cushion of the Allianz Arena, also in the Bavarian capital, home of Bayern Munich and TSV 1860 Munich and a venue for the 2006 World Cup. There is the stadium-that-looks-like-a-portable-object, of which Beijing’s 2008 “Bird’s Nest” is the best known.Russia 2018 is trying most of these approaches. The St Petersburg stadium, designed by the late Japanese architect Kisho Kurokawa some time before Russia won its World Cup bid but which only opened last year after epic delays and cost overruns, goes for the mast-hung roof look. So in somewhat shrivelled form do the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov. Kazan’s roof swoops but without wires. The Spartak Stadium in Moscow, completed in 2014, and the barely finished Mordovia Arena in Saransk are homages to the Allianz Arena, big cushions with variegated colours.The Fisht Stadium in Sochi, built for the 2014 Winter Olympics and repurposed for football, goes for the portable-object conceit: its architects Populous, the multi-national sports specialists who also designed the stadiums in Kazan, Rostov and Saransk, said it was inspired by a Fabergé egg. Volgograd, overlooked by the 85-metre high statue that commemorates the battle of Stalingrad, has a woven basket-like look with hints of the Bird’s Nest.Russia has its own contribution to the styling of stadiums, in the Soviet tradition of building tributes to the space age, flightless saucers at once cosmonautic and massive. The Cosmos Arena for the pleasant southern city of Samara bets heavily on this look – appropriately, arguably, as the city was once a centre of the Soviet space programme. At the same time, mixed metaphors being permissible in the world of iconic architecture, it is said to look like a flower.It is beyond the scope of this article to tour all 12 venues for the 2018 World Cup, so I may be missing something, but from a distance it doesn’t look like being a classic, architecturally speaking. There are no gamechangers, designs that future stadium builders can plunder for inspiration, such as the two Munich venues or Renzo Piano’s splendid Bari stadium for Italia 90 (which, it has to be said, never attained a capacity crowd until 2014).Rather we are offered weary lash-ups in which well-known themes are mixed with a further, oddly widespread, approach to stadium design – the cladding car crash, in which for no apparent reason disparate bits of surface, shape and truss are hurled together. Sochi is one of several venues with this collisional aesthetic. If you truly think it looks like a Fabergé egg then you have failed to notice something fundamental – exquisite craftsmanship, perhaps – about the original.The stadiums are mostly lumpy, their soaring ambitions grounded, some bearing too obviously the scars of budget cuts, the fabulous expenditure of the 2018 World Cup having gone to some other place than good architecture. The mottled surfaces of the Spartak and Mordovia grounds are more psoriatic than anything else. Nizhny Novgorod has a classic simplicity that puts it a cut above some others, but spoils it with a sort of giant whirlpool-patterned blue-and-white shower curtain behind its outer colonnade. This is “closely inspired,” it is alleged, “by elements from the Volga countryside”. Please.Samara, by the German practice GMP Architeken, is in its appearance the pick of the bunch. It is one of the most troubled in terms of delivery, but it has a mad kitschy oomph, which will inspire affection over time. The Ekaterinburg Arena provokes mixed feelings. Its plain bowl shape is handsome enough, but it deals extraordinarily clumsily (as did the Aquatic Centre at London 2012) with two temporary banks of seating, to be removed after the World Cup is over. It also struggles with the retained fragment of an older building incorporated into the new. The effect is weird but endearing.Almost always, after last-minute panics, the venues for these sporting extravaganzas are just about finished on time. Almost always they are both over budget and flawed in their legacy. Sometimes they throw up an architectural marvel to treasure in times to come. With the possible exceptio n of Samara the billions of the 2018 World Cup are not going to buy Russia’s cities such gems. Rowan MooreArchitecture critic, the ObserverMaria Alyokhina, 29, is a Moscow-based artist, political activist and member of punk provocateurs Pussy Riot. In 2012, she and two other members of Pussy Riot were arrested after a performance in Moscow’s Cathedral of Christ the Saviour and sentenced to two years in prison on a charge of “hooliganism motivated by religious hatred”. Since her release she has continued to agitate against the Putin administration, while the fame of Pussy Riot gave her a platform to perform around the world. A record of her experiences can be found in her book Riot Days (Allen Lane).Do you think the government sees the World Cup as an opportunity to present a better image of itself to the\u0026nbspworld?We were released two months before the end of our prison term because of the Sochi Olympics. Of course we went to Sochi, where the cossacks made their first appearance with whips, so I have no illusions about saving face or making a good impression for the west.You were arrested last month for protesting outside the Moscow headquarters of the FSB, the internal security services. What happened?The FSB blocked the messaging app Telegram in the Russian territory, because Telegram refused to give the keys for reading messages to the security services. We went with paper planes, which is the symbol of Telegram, and started throwing them at the building. We got arrested and spent 48 hours in the cage. For me that was quite frightening, because when you hear that it’s illegal to throw paper planes in your city it’s quite… strange.You have spent two years in prison and have suffered hardship. Has it affected your desire to protest at all?No.You mentioned that you were able to protest inside prison. Could you explain that?The Russian prison system is actually post-gulag, the feel of these prisons is the same. We have labour camps, all the prisoners are made to work and they are paid almost nothing, about $5 per month. There’s almost no medicine there, and conditions are really terrible. I went to court against the prison administration. It started a revolution, because they started to put up salaries, some prison guards were fired, and so on. For this world, it’s a big change. I believe that every gesture makes a change, a big change to the whole system.So protesting in Russia does have an effect, you think? Of course it does. For some people, it’s a question of their lives.What protest methods have you learned are effective?To not lose your sense of humour. In Russia, without it, something bad will happen. Actually how do you not make fun of a system that is afraid of paper planes?Is the Putin administration genuinely afraid of protesters like you?Well, if they repress people, put people in jail, start to call them enemies of the state, beat them, sometimes kill them – what does it mean? It means they’re afraid to lose their position, to lose their options to steal money till for ever.Are you optimistic about the future of Russia?The future is now. And now I’m not crying, so maybe it’s good.Interview by Killian Fox“It’s only going to get worse!” is the hashtag and rallying cry – snappy and monosyllabic in Russian – of Mediazona, an independent, crowdfunded news outlet in Moscow. Journalists in Russia are facing increasing violence, open and unpunished, and there are few legal safeguards for reporters. State censorship and intimidation, both physical and digital, is intensifying, while western IT giants are doing little to deter the bot and troll infestations targeting independent media outlets.Mediazona is a tiny outfit with a handful of reporters, which focuses on just one topic: Russia’s political trials and the manifold abuses inside its justice system. “There’s no public politics left in Russia, it’s just these criminal cases,” says its editor-in-chief Sergey Smirnov. Most of Mediazona’s content is just straight-up courtroom stenography: minutes of sessions where anti-fascists who have been tortured by security services to extract false confessions are denied bail or an independent media outlet is fined by the state regulator for embedding on its website a YouTube clip containing a single profane expression.In March 2016 a Mediazona reporter, with a team of other journalists, including two foreign ones, was attacked on the border between Chechnya and Ingushetia, two republics in the south of Russia with a long history of bloody insurgencies, counter-terrorism operations and oppression. Their bus was torched and they were beaten by unknown assailants. Some were badly injured. The investigation is stalling - there have been no arrests or even suspects in the case.Censorship and intimidation comes in many forms, such as denying access to conflict areas. It’s next to impossible, for example, for an independent journalist to report from Syria unless he or she is accredited with the ministry of defence, sequestered on the Russian military base in Hmeymim and writing glowing reports about the heroism of Russian servicemen or puff pieces about buckwheat porridge in the mess hall.Smirnov says western IT giants also play a role in censorship. Many independent outlets rely on YouTube as a platform for their video content, which gets swarmed immediately after posting with thousands of dislikes (disliked videos then sink down in ratings) and trolls in the comments. Activists and reporters have complained about this to Google, to little effect.“And it’s only going to get worse,” Smirnov concludes. Alexey KovalevAlexey Kovalev is managing editor of codastory, a non-profit news outletThere’s a club in Moscow called Petrovich, which was hugely popular when it opened in 1997, back when Russians were only too glad the Soviet Union was gone. According to the club’s website, it was inspired by “the ironic nostalgic feeling for the good old Soviet times” and, appropriately enough, it is Five minutes’ walk from the Lubyanka, the prison building where the KGB conducted mass interrogations and a post-Soviet celebration of all things USSR, from cartoons (depicted on the restaurant’s plates) and music (Buratino, the theme song from a 1976 children’s film) to food (dumplings) and drink (bad vodka), its nostalgia was close to sarcastic.When I went back this year it was exactly the same and yet entirely transformed. Because there was no longer any irony. Now the nostalgia is real: people want the good old Soviet times back. Men in nylon suits and women with gigantic hair were partying joyously like it really was 1983.A complicated form of nostalgia is now the driving force of the high Putin era – an attempt to reclaim the best bits of imperial Russia (strength, power and unity) and the Soviet Union (predictability and simplicity and the cheap, sweet shampanskoye that fuelled the post-Stalin era). The Battle for Berlin knock-off Lego sets are on sale in the Museum of the Great Patriotic War. Russia Today, the Kremlin-backed English language television network, is running a #Romanovs100 series (“4,000 photos, 4 social networks, 1 family”) to mark the centenary of the death of the Russian royal family. The popular standup comedian Igor Meerson bases his latest set around what it was like to learn English during the Soviet era, when you knew your teacher had never met a real foreigner and you would never be required to speak it. Fashion designers and influencers such as Ulyana Sergeenko (417k followers on Instagram) and Miroslava Duma (1.6m followers) are both known for looks that fuse Soviet retro and imperial luxury. Moscow’s restaurant du jour, White Rabbit, serves traditional dishes including baked beetroot, porridge and cabbage soup (on a set tasting menu for 9,500 roubles or £110).This was almost what the historian Svetlana Boym predicted in her 2001 book, The Future of Nostalgia: “reflective nostalgia” (contemplative and wistful, possibly cathartic) is replaced by “restorative nostalgia” (where others are blamed for having destroyed the homeland). What Russia is living through is somewhere between the two.One of the biggest obstacles Vladimir Putin (and any putative successor) faces is what to do with Russia’s feelings for her past. The presence of nostalgia – real, manufactured and a curious mix of both – is key to understanding contemporary Russian culture.The 100th anniversary of the Russian Revolution passed largely without comment last year. (As Russian friends joked to me, Russia hardly needed to mark it because Radio 4 did such an obsessively comprehensive job.) This is understandable: what do you say about a revolution, supposedly overturned but whose heirs are still in power? To examine the legacy of 1917 is necessary but torturous for Russia. People murmur about legacy, what happened in Germany and South Africa, about commissions for truth and reconciliation. But these things are not taken seriously in Russia.The criminal case into the royal family’s death, reopened in 2015 at the request of the church, is ongoing. Now officially known as “the royal martyrs”, the family were canonised in 2000. The British royal family has been invited to July’s processions in Ekaterinburg, to honour the memory of the tsar and his family. (Strangely, they don’t seem to have replied.) The “All-Russian pilgrimage route” to the Church on Blood in Ekaterinburg, built over the site of the house where the family was killed, has been reopened.You couldn’t make this up, especially as Putin is a lifelong KGB man and one-time card-carrying communist. But never mind all that. It is expedient for him to co-opt any feelings of longing towards empire. And it’s extremely useful to harness the 19th-century view of the tsar’s rule: God-given, unquestionable, unbreakable. 1917 is an inconvenient contradiction so we don’t talk about that. Instead we talk about how sad it was that the tsar’s family were shown no mercy in 1918.The funny thing is, not only is this project working well at home but it has become a cultural export. Angelina Jolie has bought the film rights to Simon Sebag Montefiore’s book about Catherine the Great (full name: Catherine Alexeievna Romanova). The team behind Mad Men is working on a lavish series on the Romanovs for Amazon, starring Christina Hendricks and John Slattery.Meanwhile Putin appears to be cultivating a sort of nostalgia for his own rule even while he is ruling. Last week he once again nominated Dmitry Medvedev as his prime minister, the continuation of a power relationship that has lasted almost 20 years. Medvedev is well known for his love of Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, which are hugely evocative for Russians who were young in the 1960s and 1970s. But why change the soundtrack when it’s working so well for you? Viv GroskopViv Groskop’s The Anna Karenina Fix: Life Lessons from Russian Literature is out in paperback next month (Fig Tree, £9.99)Russia continues to be regarded as, in the words of a 16th-century English traveller, a “rude and barbarous kingdom”. Along with seductive honeytrap spies and hyper-violent “ultra” football fans, one of the concerns facing visitors to the World Cup has been the infamous Russian mafia. Here’s the irony, though: the close relationship between the Kremlin and crooks probably helps ensure the games will take place in completed stadiums, and in a calm, safe environment.One of the core themes of my new book, The Vory: Russia’s Super Mafia, has been the long, bloody embrace between Russia’s rulers and its gangsters, and especially the professional criminal subculture known as the vory, the “thieves”. This predated him, but it was under Stalin – who had organised bank robberies and even pirate raids when he was a revolutionary – that this alliance was truly consummated. Stalin relied on collaborators recruited from the vory to keep the millions of political prisoners and slave labourers in the gulag camps in line, creating a new generation of gangsters who realised that there was money, power and security in working with the state.After Stalin died and the gulags largely closed down, the vory found ample new opportunities helping an increasingly corrupt Communist party elite loot their own state. In the decade of near-anarchy that followed the collapse of the Soviet system in 1991, the criminals came out of the shadows. Instead of being the friends of officials, they increasingly became their paymasters, or even indistinguishable from them. The iding lines between crime, business and politics became increasingly, dangerously blurred.Sport played a central role in this. A generation of wrestlers, boxers and martial artists, once the darlings of the state, became the hired mafia muscle of choice. Some went further: a former wrestler turned racketeer, Otari Kvantrishvili, persuaded president Boris Yeltsin to grant his “Sports Academy” freedom from import and export taxes, for example. Instead of sports training, it became a smuggler’s front, selling hundreds of thousands of tonnes of Russian aluminium, cement and titanium abroad, tax free, to line Kvantrishvili’s pockets.When Vladimir Putin became president in 2000, he offered the vory a new social contract. He would not crack down on them, as they had feared – but only so long as they refrained from doing anything that looked like a direct challenge to the state, such as continuing the kind of indiscriminate street violence that had been such a fixture of the 1990s, or supporting the rebellious southern region of Chechnya. If they did, they would be treated as enemies of the state and suppressed accordingly. Realising that the state was back, the godfathers accepted Putin’s deal.So organised crime is alive and well, but house-trained. The state is the biggest gang in town, the biggest crooks are the officials and business tycoons plundering the assets of the country. The descendants of the vory survive by working once again in alliance with, even for, corrupt bureaucrats. The days when thugs and politicians openly socialised together – Kvantrishvili was famously once photographed watching a tennis match with Yeltsin – may be over, but the links are strong. Vory can be useful, whether beating up an impertinent investigative journalist here, or smuggling in scarce western luxury items there. It is their usefulness to the state and the elite that continues to earn them their freedom of manoeuvre.That usefulness has regularly to be demonstrated and reaffirmed, though. The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics were a particular case in point. They were a bonanza for the gangsters. One, the Georgian-born godfather Aslan Usoyan, known as “Grandfather Hassan”, got in first even as the venue was being mooted in 2007. With open wallets and other threats, his henchmen snapped up land and hotels, knowing they would appreciate dramatically in value. The struggle to corner the market led to a spate of killings, with murders in Moscow and Sochi. Usoyan himself was killed in 2013, perhaps in part because of these disputes. But by the first day of the Games, all was quiet.After all, there was too much at stake. The Games cost an estimated $50bn, making them the most expensive on record. According to Transparency International, perhaps $15bn of that was embezzled. Of course, most was stolen by the oligarchs – typically from Putin’s inner circle of friends – granted the major construction and management contracts. Even so, the gangsters played their part, especially in subcontracted work such as providing labour-ganged workers for the construction, often in effect trafficked from Central Asia and forcibly returned once the job was done.But despite the last-minute building and occasional glitch, the Games were strikingly successful. The expected crime-related problems, from theft and prostitution to match fixing and illegal gambling, never materialised. In part this can be explained by the army of police and security officers deployed to what was, after all, a personal vanity project for President Putin. To a large degree, though, it reflected, the extent to which, precisely because of the importance of the event to the Kremlin, the godfathers themselves collaborated to make things go well.One middle-ranking police officer with whom I spoke afterwards admitted this. Of course, petty crooks flocked to “iron the firm” as Russian gangsters call fleecing foreigners. In his words, though: “The lads were under no illusions: if they crossed the line, then we police were the last thing they had to worry about.” So the pimps had to stay honest, the drug dealers sell smaller amounts, and of bona fide product. Pickpockets were warned off, and hotel staff advised not to take the opportunity to help themselves from guests’ luggage.The spectacle of using organised crime to control disorganised crime is not unique to Russia, but what is striking is the extent to which the gangsters are proactive. Instead of awaiting orders, they seek to predict and satisfy the whims of a powerful and often vindictive state.Which is why the gangsters are also eager to see the World Cup go smoothly. They have already made money on construction projects, and will make more catering to the less savoury tastes of the anticipated half million-plus foreign visitors. But this is another project regarded as essential to Russian soft power – when it needs all the good publicity it can get – and also close to the heart of a president consumed with his image and historic legacy.While there may not be that much the vory can do about racists and hooligans among the ultras – although there are certainly links with some of these fanaty gangs – it is already clear that once again the word is going out: the underworld powers expect everyone to be on their best behaviour.The underworld is facing internal tensions and challenges of its own. From tussles over control of heroin routes (almost a third of all drugs from Afghanistan now pass through Russia) to generational tensions as hungry young men impatiently await their chance at the top, these risk disrupting the status quo. The World Cup not only represents a test of the organisational capacities of “upperworld” Russia, it will also tell us how well the Kremlin is able to control its underworld, and the authority the existing godfathers can assert over their unruly minions.

But as he cast his vote in the capital, Caracas, at 6am local time Maduro claimed that a veritable democratic “fiesta” was under way. “Today is a historic day that no-one will forget,” the 55-year-old former bus driver and foreign minister told Telesur, Venezuela’s state-run broadcaster. “It’s a day of celebration … We are celebrating the freedom … that we enjoy in this country … of opinion, of action, of mobilization, of thought – and the freedom to choose.”Maduro loyalists parroted that message as they headed out to vote for the man who inherited Hugo Chávez’s ‘Bolivarian revolution’ after his death in 2013. “Look at the people in the streets!” Delcy Rodríguez, the president of Maduro’s widely reviled constituent assembly, declared. “A big democratic fiesta is taking place in Venezuela.”Critics ridiculed those claims, denouncing the vote, which Venezuela’s mainstream opposition is boycotting and the United States has called a sham, as a “mojiganga” (farce). “These are not elections. They are a farce intended to keep Maduro in power without popular support,” Juan Pablo Guanipa, a prominent opposition leader, told Reuters. Amid reports that polling centres had failed to open in some opposition areas and of eerily quiet streets, Maduro’s main opponent, Henri Falcón, issued a final plea for voters to exercise their democratic right. “The day has come to make history and to save Venezuela,” he tweeted.That looks unlikely, with experts predicting the lowest voter turnout since Chávez was first elected in 1998 will help return Maduro to power despite the social, political and economic turmoil gripping his country. In a televised address on the eve of Sunday’s vote, Maduro rejected claims Venezuela was “in ruins” as an imperialist smear campaign designed to topple his government.

She says that experience from three years ago gives her a sense of perspective whenever her new role threatens to overwhelm her.“At times when the Cork GAA chairperson job is getting on top of me, which it does from time to time -and life is busy too with my day job as deputy principal of Carrigaline Community School - there is a sensation where you go, ‘At least I’m here to be dealing with this situation’.”The first female Chairperson of Cork GAA and only the second woman ever to hold the highest office in a county GAA hierarchy, Kennedy comes from a family steeped in the association even though her own playing career was stymied at an early age due to simply a fear of the ball.But growing up in Killeagh with Cork All-Ireland winning hurlers, Joe Deane and Mark Landers as contemporaries and one uncle, Danno Kennedy, after whom the Killeagh pitch is named, and another, Patrick O’Mahony who made hurleys for Christy Ring, the GAA was central to her youth.Kennedy’s path to GAA officialdom began by serving on Killeagh Community Council while still studying for a BA in English and French in UCC, followed by a stint as Killeagh GAA juvenile secretary before becoming secretary to the adult club that led to isional involvement with Imokilly.That in turn led a role as Imokilly PRO and Imokilly secretary which, in turn led to becoming Cork County PRO where she enthusiastically embraced new technology and set about revolutionising Cork GAA’s communications strategy with such innovative ideas as Twitter match updates.Elected Chairperson unopposed late last year, Kennedy sees nothing unusual about becoming the first woman to hold the office given that she has always seen her involvement and that of other women in the GAA as a normal and perfectly natural occurrence. “I didn’t think there was anything that different about me coming in as a woman given our club in Killeagh. I was the only woman at the East Cork Board and I was younger but I can never say that at east Cork level or County level, I was ever patronised or made to feel uncomfortable.”While Cork may have a reputation for being one of the more traditional, counties, with a record of opposition to lifting the ban of foreign games and opening up Croke Park to rugby and soccer, Kennedy rejects the idea her election marks some sort of seismic shift in the county’s philosophy.“We may be seen to take conservative positions on certain things but we do oppose some things because they should be opposed or that’s because what our clubs think - I am delighted and others are delighted that my election has helped dispel any notion of Cork as a conservative place.“I prefer to think of my election as symbolic of a growing openness in Cork. I had significant victories in my elections for PRO and Vice Chair so there was overwhelming support and I was unopposed for the chair so that shows perhaps an openness in Cork that people didn’t realise is there.”An avid reader but an introvert by nature, Kennedy has nonetheless no hesitation in describing herself as a feminist and quotes one of her favourite writers, American Maya Angelou as she tackles the question of women in the GAA, not just in Cork, but nationally.“As Maya Angelou said ‘I’ve been a woman for many years, I would be foolish not to be on my own side’. -I’m part of that generation of women that might be a bit nervous about using the word ‘feminist’ - we would have been a bit nervous about using it for a long time.“But I’ve come to see feminism as simply being about equality and what is wrong with equality? To me, that is all feminism is - do we want different things for our daughter than for our sons, do I have different expectations for my girl pupils than for my boy pupils? I don’t.”Accepting being single and not having children affords her a latitude not available to all women, Kennedy quotes American Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg that “women belong in all places where decisions are being made”, as she reflects on whether her gender confers extra pressure in her new role.“It was not something I ever thought of at the beginning of my journey - even when I was elected, there were four women PROs in Munster - Kerry, Waterford, Limerick and Cork and that tradition goes back to when Liz Howard was elected PRO in Tipperary so it wasn’t that unusual.“It really was only when I was elected vice-chair and women started to say it me that it’s great to see women represented that I began to realise that I have a responsibility to other women and I love Madeleine Albright’s quote about a special place in hell for women who don’t help other women.”One of Kennedy’s first projects was to conduct an audit of Cork’s 167 clubs to establish levels of female involvement and the results have been positive with more than 200 women involved in key roles across both adult and juvenile clubs but she hopes that such a state is only a starting point.“Looking back, I hope I won’t be referred to as ‘The woman chair’. I don’t want someone looking down the Roll of Honour in 25 years time and saying ‘Ah look at her - the woman’- I would like there would be other women who came along and I know women who are capable of doing that.“I have said and it’s become a bit of a cliché of mine. ‘There’s no point in being the first if you are the only one’ and I don’t really want that to be the case and we have had cases recently here in Cork of clubs elected women chairs in Clyda Rovers and Dungourney, which is very encouraging.“I was happy with the results of our audit on women involvement so I am hoping to run an event later in the year to work with those women where we will have speakers into Páirc Uí Chaoimh to talk about what can be done to encourage women within the GAA to step up to a higher level.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britain s prince harry marries meghan markle at windsor castle","story":"  May 20, 2018Ceremony saw break from tradition as bride did not vow to obey her husband   May 19, 2018British designer Clare Waight Keller worked with US actress on wedding day outfit   May 20, 2018Meghan Markle has come to stand for something much more than the woman with whom the affable Prince Harry happened to fall in love "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502097.1526835618!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"max fac working group visits northern ireland for customs fact finding mission","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit Secretary David Davis and Business Secretary Greg Clark (pictured) joined Northern Secretary Karen Bradley for a visit “as part of their working group exploring potential future customs arrangements, focusing on the proposed Highly Streamlined Customs Arrangements”.

There was no media access on that occasion either and Sinn Féin complained at the time that Mr Davis did not follow the protocol of telling the local MP Mickey Brady that he would be in the Newry and Armagh constituency.Dexeu later described this as an “administrative oversight”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3502035.1526827875!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"there s not much of a buzz the royal wedding from a london pub","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPeople watch as the royal wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle unfolds during a watch party. Photograph: AP PhotoChris CarlsonThe bunting was out, with images of Harry and Meghan running across the top of the bar and union jacks standing in flower pots beneath the big screen televisions, but half an hour before the wedding was to begin, nobody had turned up. In the days before the wedding, newspapers warned that street parties and other events could be filled to overflowing because so few had applied for permits from local councils. In Hull, there was not a single application and there was little stirring in the capital either.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“I think it’s because it’s not in London, there’s not much of a buzz about it,” the barman said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAs the guests took their places in St George’s Chapel in Windsor, more guests made their way into the pub too, starting with a cadaverous young man with crude tattoos running up his arms and the black rings of a dirty hangover circling his eyes. He was followed by an old gentleman with an ancient cocker iel and soon afterwards, two middle aged men in t-shirts, shorts and dark glasses who ordered a bottle of white wine.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA mysterious trio sat around a table on the terrace outside, led by a sour-faced old skinhead with a Fred Perry shirt and a dodgy hip who sat between a young Roseanne Barr and a blonde Morticia Addams. Was one his wife and the other his daughter? Both his daughters? Or both his wives?\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNear them sat a large, red-faced gentleman with a newspaper opened at the racing page, which he studied closely throughout the ceremony, making careful marks with a pencil.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe hungover cadaver was the first to speak, nodding towards the screen as Prince Harry waited for his bride to arrive.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Poor fucker. He can say goodnight to his nights out now,” he said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe barman chipped in that, having tried marriage once, he was never going there again but our small congregation was soon silenced by the sight of Meghan Markle walking up the aisle to Handel’s “Eternal Source of Light Divine”. We kept a respectful silence for the first few minutes, apart from the odd comment about how the older royals were looking, with opinion ided about Prince Philip.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“He’s 97 next month, how do you expect him to look?” said the man with the cocker iel.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen the Archbishop of Canterbury asked if anyone knew any reason why Harry and Meghan should not marry, the man with the paper shouted “Yes, I want her” and gave a phlegmy little cackle. By now, the pair in shorts were on their second bottle of wine, Roseanne had bellied up to the bar for another round and we were all settling in nicely.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWhen Bishop Michael Curry began his address, we all initially switched off just as we would for any sermon but a few lines in, heads began to turn upwards.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There is power, power in love. If you don’t believe me, think of a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to centre around you and your beloved. Oh, there’s power, power in love,” he said, and he had captured us all.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“There’s a certain sense in which when you are loved, and you know it, when someone cares for you and you know it, when you love and you show it, it actually feels right. There’s something right about it.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspI looked across at the cadaver, who had tears in his eyes, the pathos evoked by the bishop’s rhetoric, perhaps quickened by the onset of post-alcoholic depression.\u0026nbsp“He speaks very well,” said the man with the cocker iel.\u0026nbsp“Fucking right,” said the cadaver.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the bishop had stopped there, he would have held the admiration of the pub but as he went on and on, the screens began to show the royal family’s reaction, with Camilla starting to giggle beneath her huge pink hat. Zara Philips looked as if she had swallowed a tennis ball and the Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie seemed to think it was the greatest lark ever. Elton John, not strictly speaking a member of the royal family, appeared to have just eaten a plateful of sick.\u0026nbspThe pub started getting restless too, with Roseanne the first to voice a protest.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“He’s taking the fucking piss now,” she said as she went back up to the bar, and the skinhead grunted in agreement while Morticia rolled her eyes.\u0026nbspThe mood lightened again when the bishop wound up and the choir sang Stand by Me and by the time Harry and Meghan emerged from the chapel to the cheering crowd outside, the pub was full of loyal cheer. The two men in shorts, now halfway through the third bottle, were discussing the low key public response to the wedding and the older of the two thought he had the answer.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“It’s not a front row wedding because Harry’s too far back in the succession.

Both Skripals survived the attack.The Government has blamed the Kremlin for ordering the attempted murder and said it would investigate Russian wealth as part of its response.Mr Abramovich, who is worth an estimated £8 billion, made his fortune in Russia\u0027s oil industry in the 1990s. The billionaire, 51, has been a frequent visitor to London since he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003.Unlike some other wealthy Russian investors, he never took UK residency but has continued to visit the UK on a Tier-1 visa.Amber Rudd ordered a review of Russian holders of Tier-1 investor visas in MarchHe was not at Wembley on Saturday night, when Chelsea defeated Manchester United 1-0 in the FA Cup final.  Mr Abramovich has not attended every Chelsea cup final in the past, and it is not clear whether the delay in issuing travel documents affected his travel plans.Earlier this year Swiss newspapers reported that he had twice applied for residency in Switzerland.In January the island of Jersey offered him residency as a high value inidual.The same month, he was included on a list of officials and oligarchs close to Vladimir Putin that could serve as a basis for future US sanctions.  Although the “name-and-shame” list of 210 people published by the US Treasury did not stipulate any punitive measures, it was drawn up as part of sanctions legislation reluctantly signed by Donald Trump in August.  Tier 1 visas are open to applicants from outside the European Economic Area who are willing to invest at least £2 million in the UK economy.The visas are valid for three years and four months, and can be extended another two years before requiring renewal.The Home Office website says applicants can expect a decision on an application within three weeks.A spokesman for Mr Abramovich declined to comment.Ben Wallace, the Home Office security minister, said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.He added: In 2014 and 2015 we took action to tighten up the Tier 1 investor route. This included introducing new powers to refuse applications where there are reasonable grounds to believe funds have been obtained unlawfully. As a result of these reforms, applications reduced by 84 per cent.“As the Prime Minister and former Home Secretary made clear, we are taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced.”Inside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBRoyal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding dress: Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy designs the royal bridal gown of the yearInside the royal wedding evening reception: Idris Elba turned DJ as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle danced to 1980s hits and R\u0026ampBThe Handmaid\u0026#39s Tale, season 2 episode 1 review: Elisabeth Moss is outstanding as we make a terrifying return to GileadA Very English Scandal, episode 1 review: Hugh Grant is both charming and bone-chilling in this brilliant take on the Thorpe affairMeghan Markle given palace\u0026#39s blessing to fight for feminism as she takes her place in the Royal familyRoyal wedding guest list: Celebrities from the Clooneys to the Beckhams, and Pippa MiddletonRoyal wedding bridesmaids and pageboys: From Prince George to the Mulroneys, meet the real stars of the big day Royal wedding guests moved to tears by Prince Charles speech about his \u0026#39darling old Harry\u0026#39Who is Michael Curry, the royal wedding preacher who stole the show at the ceremony?Nottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry will live as a married coupleRoyal wedding cake: Fitting tribute to the big day - a break from tradition but with British customs at its heartMeet Meghan Markle\u0026#39s family: The diplomat uncle, the yoga teacher mother and the cannabis-growing nephewComment: Apologies to you miserable naysayers – a royal wedding is more relevant now than ever beforeHarry and Meghan delay honeymoon to plan first public appearance at Prince Charles 70th partyThe \u0026#39child whisperer\u0026#39 nanny who kept the bridesmaids and pageboys in line at the royal wedding Donald Trump demands investigation into alleged FBI infiltration of presidential campaign Comment: Sorry, America, the British monarchy did not need dragging into the 21st century Comment: We in Sussex welcome our first ever DuchessWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/20/TELEMMGLPICT000164133342_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqeo_i_u9APj8RuoebjoAHt0k9u7HhRJvuo-ZLenGRumA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"royal wedding a list guests give glimpse prince harry meghan","story":"Celebrity friends of the Duke and Duchess posting pictures of the outfits at the intimate Frogmore House receptionCelebrity friends of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle shared glimpses on social media of the intimate second reception for the couple following the Royal wedding.A select 200 close friends were invited to the evening party at Frogmore House following the main reception at Windsor Castle, which was attended by the 600 guests who were also at the St George’s Chapel ceremony.The smaller reception was billed as a private affair and a chance for the selected guests to relax and celebrate with the happy couple.Frogmore House, a 17th century English country house, stands in the home park of Windsor Castle and is part of the Crown Estate.

She\u0027s just so genuine and warm and radiant. She\u0027s just glowing.She\u0027s a strong woman. She knows what she wants, and it was really an absolute joy working with her.Asked about the moment the Duchess was able to look at herself fully dressed and ready in the mirror on Saturday morning, Ms Waight Keller said: She was just glowing.There\u0027s so much emotion on a day like that anyway. But I think particularly when it all comes together, I think, is tremendous. She was absolutely radiant.Asked if there was any tears from the bride, she said: No, she was incredibly composed. It was really quite extraordinary. She\u0027s just the most beautiful person.Asked what the Duchess\u0027s mother, Doria Ragland, had thought of her daughter, Ms Waight Keller said: As she went into her car, her mother was already sitting in the car and you just could see there was so much love between them.The Queen was later seen being driven back to Windsor Castle soon after the service at the Royal Chapel of All Saints in Windsor Great Park.As a few Windsor Farm shop regulars watched, her Range Rover swept into a side entrance onto the castle estate.The Queen is driven into Windsor Castle after a Sunday trip to churchThere has still been no sight yet today of the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex who are expected to leave Windsor Castle, where they stayed overnight. They are due to travel home to Nottingham Cottage, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.The Duchess of Sussex was a calm and chatty bride with no signs of nerves on her wedding morning, according to her hair stylist.Serge Normant said it was dreamy to work with the Duchess, creating a bun that was messy in a controlled way.The Duchess of Sussex\u0026#39s hair was styled into a bun that was \u0026#39messy in a controlled way\u0026#39Describing her demeanour on Saturday morning, he said: She was calm, yeah.

The couple spent their honeymoon at Broadlands House in Hampshire – although that would be no guarantee of favourable weather. Kensington Palace said the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will continue to live in Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of the palace, but they are also reported to be moving to a bigger apartment.They have been been living in the cottage since their engagement in November 2017.Reportedly referred to as Notts Cotts, the property - only yards from the Duke\u0027s childhood home within Kensington Palace itself, has been a base for both the Duke and his brother, Prince William, over the past decade.  As the previous occupants, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent two and a half years at the cottage after their royal wedding in 2011, before moving to a permanent apartment inside Kensington Palace to accommodate their growing family. Harry moved into Nottingham Cottage shortly after. An aerial view of Kensington PalaceIt is the smallest of Kensington Palace\u0027s multiple residences, residing in a part of the grounds that once housed important members of staff. There are two rooms and a private garden. In the long term, the Duke and Duchess are expected to vacate Nottingham Cottage for a 21-room Kensington Palace apartment, adjacent to that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.The apartment\u0027s roof and windows have recently been refurbished, while the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester moved out of it last November - giving legs to rumours the newlyweds will move there.As neighbours, the royal brothers could inhabit what was once a single suite of apartments at Kensington Palace, before it was split in two in the 1950s. The apartments are even suspected to share a secret door.The royal brothers will remain as neighbours at Kensington PalaceInitially however, the new Duke will have a cousin for a neighbour: Princess Eugenie and her fiancé Jack Brooksbank recently took-up residence at Ivy Cottage after announcing their engagement in January this year.That wedding will also take place at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on October 12.Among the 200 guests invited to the evening reception at Frogmore House were senior members of the Royal family. The Duke of York was pictured driving his daughters to the event, as was Prince Edward.

He writes: The Corporation’s anchors were Kirsty Young (a reassuring voice as ever) and Dermot O’Leary (was he on the wrong channel?). This unlikely pair tag-teamed with Huw Edwards (solid, dependable, a bit boring), who appeared to have been on a pre-wedding diet. Sitting side-on to the camera for some strange reason, the newly svelte Welshman couldn’t quite get his autocue-reading right and kept glancing off-screen as if distracted by something more interesting.ITV\u0027s audience peaked with 3.6 million viewers, at a different time to BBC One - just after 2pm.On ITV, coverage - which was fronted by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham - averaged 2.5 million viewers and a 18.6 per cent share between 9.25am and 3pm.The five-minute audience peak on BBC One is the biggest across all channels this year, the broadcaster said.

Speeches, including from Meghan herself, were also expected at the evening reception where the couple were to take their first dance.Leaving for the evening reception earlier in the evening Prince Harry proved he was the perfect gentleman as he opened the door of a vintage car to let his bride step in.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex in a classic E-Type Jaguar heading off to their wedding receptionMs Markle wore a sleek Stella McCartney dress with a halter neck, showing off her shoulders and back with her hair up in a chic bun.The dress was described as a “bespoke lily white high neck gown made of silk crepe”, with satin shoes from Aquazurra with soles painted in baby blue: her “something blue”.Her hair had been styled by George Northwood especially for the more relaxed evening. The couple travelled from Windsor Castle to Frogmore House in a silver blue Jaguar E-Type Concept Zero. The number plate was E19 05 18, marking their wedding date. This vehicle was originally manufactured in 1968, and has since been converted to electric power, suiting the couple’s eco-credentials.Prince Harry opens the door to the Jaguar allowing his wife to get into the passenger seatPrince Harry appears to have given his bride a poignant wedding day gift -

Is the adoption of other people\u0027s customs and cultures fair game or has political correctness gone mad?\u0026nbspDavid Barnett treads warily\u0026nbspLet’s get this out of the way: I am a straight, white, middle-aged man, so what follows you may take with a pinch of salt or disregard completely. But we’re going to talk, you and I, about the thorny issue of cultural appropriation.It was only a year ago that Oxford Dictionaries put the phrase into their official lexicons, with the definition, “the unacknowledged or inappropriate adoption of the customs, practices, ideas, etc. of one people or society by members of another and typically more dominant people or society.”Cultural appropriation is sometimes so blatant it smacks us in the face. The Black and White Minstrel Show ran on British television for – what seems now to us, looking back at it – and astonishing 20 years, from 1958.Even halfway through its run the show, in which white entertainers “blacked up” to sing songs in a Deep South of America style, was the subject of petitions calling for it to be taken off the air because of its in-your-face racism. It can hardly be seen now without an overwhelming feeling of embarrassment. How did we ever think that was acceptable?The show was harking back to the minstrel shows in 19th-century America, and blackface was a popular form of entertainment until the enlightenment of the 1960s, coupled with rising racial tensions across the US, finally put paid to it. Even Al Jolson, dubbed “the world’s greatest entertainer”, was renowned for performing in blackface. Jolson was Jewish, and while there can never be any excuses made today for blacking up, it’s interesting that in their 2008 book the Encyclopedia of American Jewish History, authors Stephen Harlan Norwood and Eunice G Pollack talk of Jolson’s 1927 movie The Jazz Singer in terms which suggest some kind of what we would today call intersectionality. For example: “Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not…The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world\u0027s history.”Can a Jewish man really pretend to be a black man without racism? Is this cultural appropriation of the very worst kind or solidarity that only two historically subjugated peoples can appreciate? And what, then, of a Jewish woman who dresses up as a Japanese woman for entertainment?The cries of “cultural appropriation” were resounding around social media even before Netta Barzilai had finished her (ultimately competition-winning) performance of Toys, the Israeli entry in this month’s Eurovision song contest held in Lisbon.Netta wore a stylised kimono and was surrounded by dozens of maneki neko waving lucky cat statues. Twitter in particular was rather exercised by the thought of the cultural appropriation taking place before its very eyes. Or, I should say, mainly white Western Twitter. It seems the only people not too fussed were the Japanese themselves.According to the website soranews24, which repackages and discusses Japanese news stories for an English speaking audience, the overwhelming response on the ground seems to be a mildly nonplussed reaction.The site quoted from Japanese social media accounts which included the responses, “Culture is meant to be stolen. If it’s not worth stealing, then it isn’t culture”, “If people keep claiming ‘cultural appropriation’ then people will not touch our culture. Then, people will not understand our culture and it will be easier to become our enemy”, and, perhaps crucially, “Westerners care too much about silly things”.Is that the problem? Are we, Westerners, liberal Westerners, too over-sensitive of the feelings of others brought on by white guilt? Or are we right to call out what we think is wrong when we see it? Should we wait before speaking, to see what the actual people affected think? Or is it our duty to step in first?Perhaps it’s now we should go back to the Oxford Dictionaries definition of cultural appropriation, particularly the bit that talks about the “more dominant people or society”. Is Israel a more dominant culture than Japan? Or vice-versa? What do we think? What do they think?A couple of weeks before Eurovision, Eastern dress was setting Twitter alight again, this time when a Utah teenager posted online pictures of her wearing her prom dress which was actually a qipao, traditional Chinese dress. The 18-year-old was accused of cultural appropriation and casual racism. People of Chinese heritage chimed in with arguments on both sides of the debate, with some pointing out that the outfit was originally worn by women carrying out domestic duties, and thus not something to be really celebrated, and another writing, “I’m Asian and Chinese, you looked beautiful in that dress, I’m sorry you got bashed for it.”Cyprus\u0027 singer Eleni Foureira performs the song FuegoIsrael\u0027s singer Netta performs the song Toy Belgium\u0027s singer Sennek performs the song A Matter Of Time Estonia\u0027s singer Elina Nechayeva performs the song La ForzaCroatia\u0027s singer Franka performs the song Crazy Albania\u0027s singer Eugent Bushpepa performs the song MallCzech Republic\u0027s singer Mikolas Josef performs the song Lie To MeIreland\u0027s singer Ryan O\u0027Shaughnessy performs the song TogetherSwiss duo ZIBBZ\u0027s singer Corinne Gfeller performs the song StonesBulgarian group Equinox\u0027 singer Zhana Bergendorff (R) performs the song BonesLithuania\u0027s singer Ieva Zasimauskaite performs the song When We\u0027re OldFinland\u0027s singer Saara Aalto performs the song MonstersGreece\u0027s singer Yianna Terzi performs the song Oniro MouAustria\u0027s singer Cesar Sampson performs the song Nobody But YouAzerbaijan\u0027s singer Aisel performs the song X My HeartIceland\u0027s singer Ari Olafsson performs the song Our ChoiceArmenia\u0027s singer Sevak Khanagyan performs the song QamiMacedonian duo Eye Cue\u0027s lead vocalist Marija Ivanovska (R) and guitarist Bojan Trajkovski perform the song Lost And FoundBelarus\u0027 singer Alekseev performs the song ForeverNorway\u0027s singer Alexander Rybak performs the song That\u0027s How You Write A SongRomanian band The Humans perform the song GoodbyeSerbia\u0027s band Sanja Ilic \u0026amp Balkanika perform the song Nova DecaSan Marino\u0027s Jessika featuring Jenifer Brening perform the song Who We AreDenmark\u0027s singer Rasmussen performs the song Higher GroundPoland\u0027s singer Gromee feat.

The fashion shows routinely feature collections riffing off a range of global cultures. For the coming autumn, Gucci recently unveiled a series of headwear inspired by Sikh turbans. Vogue ran a photoshoot in its “Diversity Issue” last year with a model in full Japanese geisha outfit. Not unusual, and perhaps nothing wrong with it… save for in both cases (and in the Victoria’s Secret show last year in which a model flaunted a Native American-style headdress) all the models were white.Here’s where cultural appropriation smacks up against representation. Maybe if Victoria’s Secret had employed a Native American model, if Vogue had used a Japanese model, if Gucci had – as the Sikh Coalition suggested in the aftermath – used Sikh models who would have properly observed the correct way to wear what is, after all, a sacred clothing item, then the later dissemination of these items on to the high street might not be quite so problematic.There’s a difference, too, between fashion and performance. When I was very young, on a holiday at a Pontin’s camp on the North-West coast, I was wrapped in a blanket, had two stripes of lipstick put across my face, and a feather from a passing seagull taped to my head. I was entered into the fancy dress contest (I didn’t win). I was of course, a Red Indian, as Native Americans were called in those less-enlightened times.As bad as the Black and White Minstrels? Possibly. But “Red Indians” back then were almost a fictional, fairytale group of people, the image drawn from Monday matinee westerns not renowned for historical accuracy, from Peter Pan, from Hiawatha and Little Plum. Would I have dressed my children like that when they were the same age? Undoubtedly not. Times change. Sensitivities alter.Utah teenager, Keziah Daum, sparked a huge debate on Twitter about cultural appropriation after posting photos of her traditional Chinese prom dressAnd I look down at what I’m wearing right now as I type this. A T-shirt, which has its origins as an undergarment in 19th-century America. A pair of jeans, which were originally developed in Italy (Genoa, which gave rise to “jeans”) and France (the fabric of Nimes, or de Nimes, from which is derived “denim”). A pair of flip-flops (don’t judge me), evolved from the Japanese zōri which servicemen took back to America post-Second World War (though early flip-flops have been discovered in ancient Egyptian burial sites).I am a melange of styles borrowed, begged and stolen from around the world. Is this cultural appropriation, several generations down the line? Should I be wearing what my grandfathers wore? Polyester slacks and an Oxford shirt, a cardigan, brogues? Where is the line, and on which side of it are we?Music is another cultural appropriation battleground. Every time Katy Perry or Taylor Swift goes “ghetto” for another video, or Lana Del Ray puts on a Native American headdress, it’s there to see. White folks stole rock’n’roll from African rhythms filtered through the American South, we stole electronic dance music from the predominantly-black post-disco clubs of Chicago and Detroit, and Italy. Take away the cultural appropriation, and what’s left? A couple of rousing choruses of Knees Up, Mother Brown or The Lambeth Walk, perhaps.Should we talk about food? Those great British traditions such as pizza, or chow mein, or curry? A few miles from me, Bradford is awash with curry houses. The clientele is largely white. Is that cultural appropriation? Well, no, because most of the restaurants are owned and worked in by people of South Asian heritage. But what was deemed cultural appropriation was when, earlier this year, a restaurant called Fanny’s announced it was opening a venue for the purveying of “posh kebabs” in London’s Stoke Newington.The move was lambasted on Twitter because, for one, Stoke Newington is a hub for Turkish restaurants and takeaways… the people who, you know, invented the kebab. For another, because the people behind Fanny’s weren’t Turkish (one of the founders is called Claude Compton, for your information), and the tag-line “posh kebabs” intimated that these “lads from Fulham” were basically going to beat the Turks at their own game (as a side note, Fanny’s subsequently dropped the “posh” bit from their marketing and logo).Fanny\u0027s Kebabs finally dropped the \u0027posh\u0027 bit from their marketing (fannyskebabsInstagram)If you’ve made it this far, you might be wondering where I’m heading with all this. And the honest answer is, I just don’t know. Cultural appropriation seems, on the face of it, like it should be something that all of us should fight against, but the flip-side of that is knowing exactly just what it is and when we should call it out.As I said at the top of this piece, take what I say with a pinch of salt, given that I am a middle-aged white man. But where does that leave me, if we remove years of embedded cultural appropriation? Dressed in my grandad’s clothes, listening to a 78 of George Formby classics, and clutching a chip butty? And on that score, should I be calling cultural appropriation on the New York magazine The Insider’s awestruck piece last month on a Turkish restaurant that was selling this remarkable new thing, a sandwich stuffed with fries?The answer’s no, of course, because cultural appropriation will never affect me in the way it does other, marginalised people. I have working-class roots but I’m still pretty close to the top of the privilege chain all I can realistically get away with is some faux outrage at posh kids slumming it at Wetherspoons and Greggs for Instagram likes.But maybe those who identify as white, liberal allies should hit the pause button before calling out cultural appropriation, and just take a moment to think. The obvious stuff, the outright horror of the Black and White Minstrels and the more subtle but by no means any less problematic racism, yes, by all means, dig in. Dog-piling on teenagers for wearing a prom dress, maybe hold off a bit.Cultural appropriation is a big desert, and one on which we might have to draw our own personal lines in the sand as to what we know in our guts is wrong, and what we think might be, possibly, a little bit off.And with that, I bid you sayonara.Black and White minstralsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But he soon could face a far bigger test – maintaining his grip on a country that is fast becoming a failed state.Since Maduro took over from Hugo Chavez – his mentor, who died in 2013 – Venezuela’s crisis has steadily intensified as a result of lower oil prices, corruption and a socialist system plagued with mismanagement. But as Maduro has sought to further consolidate power in the past 12 months, the economy, public services, security and health care have all but collapsed. Armed gangs and Colombian guerrilla groups are operating unchecked on Venezuela’s borders. Pro-government militias are terrorising urban areas, while police stand accused of extrajudicial killings. Four of the 10 most dangerous cities in the world are now in Venezuela, according to a 2017 study by the Igarape Institute, a Brazilian think tank that studies violence.Venezuela halts air and sea traffic with three neighbouring countriesHundreds if not thousands of members of the armed forces are deserting, in part due to meagre rations, according to military analysts.Power and water grids and the transportation systems are breaking down. In just the first three months of the year, Venezuela suffered over 7,000 blackouts.Saddled with a soaring inflation rate that has put food out of reach, weakened and thin Venezuelans are falling ill. Doctors say cases of diseases once thought largely eradicated – malaria, diphtheria, measles and tuberculosis – are not only resurfacing but surging. A child stands in front of water containers in Guarenas, VenezuelaIn a nation that lives off oil, production is collapsing as plants break down and the bankrupt government cannot fix equipment. Venezuela’s unpaid creditors are beginning to tighten the financial noose, moving to attach the country’s offshore assets. At the state oil giant, 25,000 workers – more than a quarter of its staff – quit last year in a mass exodus. Fleeing workers are joining a flood of humanity, at least 5,000 people a day, exiting the country. The outflow has left schools without teachers, hospitals without doctors and nurses, and utilities without electricians and engineers. “A failed state is one that cannot meet the most basic functions of government,” says Jean Paul Leidenz, an economist at Ecoanalitica, a Caracas-based analytical firm. Leidenz continues: “Venezuela now certainly has that characteristic.” Buses have become scarce along a Guarenas roadDuring a campaign stop in the eastern Guayana City on Wednesday, Maduro conceded his government “had made mistakes”. But he blamed the country’s crisis mostly on outside forces and domestic enemies and proclaimed the nation’s socialist revolution would see Venezuela through to better days.“Thanks to the social system created by the revolution, the people are protected and prepared,” he says. “We have a lot more to do, and that’s why we need victory.”In her cement block home in eastern Caracas, Zulay Perez, 63, walked into her kitchen and turned on the tap. “See? Nothing,” she says. “No water. No water at all.”For Venezuelans like Perez – the wife of a factory worker – life was never easy. But in the past, she says, the couple would get running water at least a few days each month. This year, they have had water once – and even then for just a few hours. The shortages have spread in 2018, reaching into middle-class and wealthy neighbourhoods, prompting hundreds of spontaneous, if small, protests.Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Venezuela\u0027s Maduro bids to be new ‘Christ of the poor’ with help from ‘Hand of God’Argentina\u0027s football legend Diego Maradona takes part in the closing rally of the electoral campaign of Venezuelan acting President Acting Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro greeting his supporters during his campaign closing act in Cabimas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles speaks to supporters during a campaign rally in Caracas Supporters of Henrique Capriles RandonskiSupporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer during a campaign rally in Merida, VenezuelaSupporters of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro wear a moustache during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro holds his grandson as he stands with his family on stageSupporters of Venezuelan opposition candidate for  president, Henrique Capriles Radonski, cheer during his campaign closing act in BarquisimetoA portrait of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez is held by a supporter of  Venezuelan acting President and presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro during his closing campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro greets supporters holding Cuba\u0027s and Venezula\u0027s flags with during his closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaVenezuela\u0027s opposition candidate, Henrique Capriles, holds a dove as a sign of peace during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoAn Henrique Capriles\u0027 supporter holds a dove besides a photo of the candidate during a campaign rally in BarquisimetoSupporters hold a toddler wearing a Maduro-style mustache at the closing campaign rally for Venezuela\u0027s acting President Nicolas Maduro Supporters of opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles cheer for him at his closing campaign rally in BarquisimetoA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski attends a campaign rally in CaracasVenezuela\u0027s opposition leader and presidential candidate Henrique Capriles greets supporters during a campaign rally Supporters of Venezuela\u0027s ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro, one dressed as Fidel Castro and the other as Cuban revolutionary hero Ernesto \u0027Che\u0027 Guevara, stand on a bus before the start of Maduro\u0027s closing campaign rally in Caracas, VenezuelaA sign poking fun of ruling party presidential candidate Nicolas Maduro is seen during an opposition campaign rallyA supporter of Venezuelan opposition candidate Henrique Capriles Radonski shows a poster that reads \u0027my mom wants to be your mother-in-law\u0027The government blames a drought, as well as electricity outages partly attributed to sabotage by opposition activists. But community groups say the cause of the damage is more systematic – a combination of corruption, the flight of specialised workers from the country and the difficulty of buying imported spare parts in a nation were the currency is so worthless that you could wallpaper a building with money notes for less than the cost of paint.In past years, Perez says, water would run frequently enough to fill up the big blue tanks the couple keep in a corner. Now she goes outside, to a gutter where stray dogs defecate, to collect water that she boils and uses for cleaning. For drinking and bathing, her husband carries empty bottles to the home of her sister, who has larger cisterns and has been somewhat more fortunate with service.The road to Caracas – where cargo trucks have become a novel way of travelThe water crisis is one symptom of the failing state around her. Another is the lack of food. Perez’s daughter, a public school teacher, collected back wages last week. The family used the money to buy a rare treat – a dozen eggs. Skyrocketing inflation means they cost 480,000 bolivares – the equivalent of nearly one week of her husband’s salary. Perez, nearly emaciated, has lost 17 pounds in the past year.“I feel hopeless,” she says, adding that she fears the government will ensure a Maduro victory on election day, no matter what voters do. “We want change, but I don’t think we’ll get it.”Inside Caracas University Hospital – one of the capital’s largest – the first thing that hits you is the smell.“We’ve had no water for two weeks, and it just came back today,” says a 29-year-old doctor who guided two journalists through its dim halls. The doctor spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid reprisals, since the hospital’s administration is pro-government. “For a while,” she says, “some toilets couldn’t be flushed.” Medical shortages have gripped Venezuelan for several years. But things have markedly worsened over the past few months as water and power have become more intermittent. Three weeks ago, the electricity went out for a whole weekend, with generators able to power only the emergency ward, surgery rooms and the intensive care unit.As Venezuela has rocketed into hyperinflation, drugs and supplies – almost all of them imported – are increasingly unaffordable.Malaria was once rare here. Now the hospital is receiving almost 40 infected patients a day. The worst cases end up in the infectious disease ward, which on the recent visit was loaded with patients suffering from preventable or treatable illnesses that have run amok in a weakened population.Lethargic measles patients filled a room marked “isolation”. There was a round hole in the door from a missing knob, allowing the air inside to easily filter into a hallway. The corridors echoed with the coughs of skeletal HIV patients, some of whom are suffering complications from tuberculosis.A child carries a plastic container on the outskirts of CaracasThere will be fewer and fewer doctors to treat them. “A big part of our newly graduated medical students are leaving the country right away. I’d say 90 percent of them,” says Oscar Noya, a doctor who heads the hospital’s malaria department. On a recent afternoon, Leon Avila, a 54-year-old security guard, was waiting at a bus stop at the bottom of a hill in Guarenas, a slum 18 miles east of Caracas. To reach his home at the top, he would normally travel by public bus.But of the 25 buses that used to ply the route five years ago, all but two are out of commission because of a lack of affordable spare parts. In Venezuela these days, a single tyre can cost 100 times what a bus driver makes in a month. Even the two buses currently running are suffering from breakdowns – so frequent that residents have been forced into a relatively novel type of transit – cargo trucks, whose drivers charge them a fare.Zulay Perez has only had running water once in the past year“Travelling like cargo is now our day-to-day life,” Avila says.In Caracas, 70 per cent of the city’s 18,000 buses are not operating. The rest work only intermittently, says Hugo Ocando, a transportation union leader. Ten to 15 per cent have gone out of order this year alone, he continued. After a midsize cargo truck pulled up to Avila’s bus stop, he piled into the back with a mob of others. “Stop boarding people! We’re getting asphyxiated!”, someone shouted in the back.In moments, more than 30 people were crammed inside, holding on to ropes to keep from falling. Much of the cabin’s interior was dark. There were no windows, with the only light and air funnelling through the open back doors.“It’s like we’re animals,” Avila says. The mainstream opposition is boycotting Sunday’s vote, citing a lack of guarantees of a free and fair election. Maduro’s government has banned some key opposition figures from running, kept others behind bars and prompted at least one to seek asylum at the Chilean Embassy in Caracas. Maduro, 55, will still face two main challengers: Henri Falcon, a former governor, and Javier Bertucci, an evangelical pastor. But despite growing international pressure, including an escalating list of US sanctions, few here believe that Maduro is prepared to lose. The government was widely accused of fraud in an election last year for an all-powerful legislative body. Venezuela blocks opposition candidates from presidential electionVenezuela’s opposition refuses to recognise surprise win for MaduroEvidence of ‘crimes against humanity’ in Venezuela conflict, says UNYet with so many Venezuelans expected to skip the vote, Maduro may genuinely edge out his opponents Sunday. According to the Delphos polling firm, Maduro and Falcon are neck and neck among likely voters, with Maduro at 38 percent compared with Falcon at 37 percent. Bertucci is polling in third, with 20 percent support.Critics say some Venezuelans may vote for Maduro out of fear – of losing state jobs or government-subsidised food baskets. Maduro says they will vote for him out of national pride. “When you ask Donald Trump who’s going to win in Venezuela, even he says, ‘Maduro,’” the Venezuelan leader said at a rally last week. “And why are we going to win? Because we are the fatherland, of history, of dignity.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

At that stage, I had written the narrative in English and most of the dialogues in dialect. Then I started both narrative and dialogue in dialect and the novel just shot along.”Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

And now it might be one of our best hopes of finding alien life in our own solar system.Scientists announced this week that there is a water plume coming out of Europa, a moon of Jupiter and one of the prime candidates for life in our solar system.This comes in the wake of discovering plumes on Saturn’s moon Enceladus, during the Cassini mission, which suggested the strange moon has the building blocks of life. We might find alien life on Jupiter’s ocean moon, Nasa saysWhile the discovery about Europa is brand new, the data used to deduce it was old. The plume itself might be ancient, and could help us to finally solve the mystery of whether are alone in the universe – or even alone in our little patch of it: the Solar System.That’s because, while the plume themselves might be thrilling, they’re more exciting for what they might mean. They are spewing out water that would otherwise be hidden beneath the moon’s thick icy crust, and which would therefore be very difficult to access.“If Europa has plumes erupting into space, that really provides a new window for future exploration,” says Xianzhe Jia, a space physicist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and the lead author on the new study. “We might be able to find out what’s going on in the ocean.”The awareness that there might be a plume arrived gradually: first in pictures taken from the Hubble Space Telescope that seemed to suggest something strange was happening, and then through further, clearer Hubble pictures. One of those later sets of images sent Jia and his team back to the data – which already been collected all the way back in 1997, from a spacecraft that set off in 1989.“We already had the data  we had a flyby over this region,” he says, and the scientists resolved to “look more carefully at the data we have”.It worked. “In fact, when we look at the data more carefully – at the closest approach to the plume, we did detect strange changes which had not been explained before in the past,” he says.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceNasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of spaceFrom the International Space Station, Expedition 42 Flight Engineer Terry W.

These two pieces of information immediately stood up – seeming to tell us that this minimal signal is being produced by a localised source, of particles.”In scientific terms, the team had a very good hunch that something was going on. But they needed to prove it, so they used extensive computer modelling to work out whether the data lined up with what would be be expected if there were a plume – and it did, with what Jia calls “stunning” precision.That’s why, thought the data is fairly old, the discovery could never have been made at the time. Only with a hunch, and brand new modelling techniques, could scientists make sense of it.“Twenty years ago, you might have had the idea that this was related to the plume,” he says. “But the models of the time wouldn’t allow you to draw that conclusion – we’d have to wait for better images from future missions.”The Cassini mission to Enceladus (which Jia was not involved in) has already given scientists an understanding that they can bring to other plumes.“The knowledge that has been developed on the Enceladus missions and the studies gives us a very good idea about, if you do have water plumes in space, how would that change the magnetic and the plasma environment?”One of the central disappointments of the Cassini mission was that much of what it learnt about Enceladus suggested this strange moon was worthy of much more study – but its mission was imminently coming to a close. That is not the case with Europa. Both Nasa and the European Space Agency are gearing up to send missions to Jupiter and the system that orbits around it.The ESA hopes to send its Juice mission to Jupiter’s moons in 2022 – and it will look at the other moons that are thought to have large oceans hiding beneath their surfaces, Ganymede and Callisto, as well as Europa. Nasa’s Europa Clipper mission is being prepared for launch the same year.“If plumes exist, and we can directly sample what’s coming from the interior of Europa, then we can more easily get at whether Europa has the ingredients for life,” said Robert Pappalardo, Europa Clipper project scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.“That’s what the mission is after. That’s the big picture.”  Nasa\u0027s canny decision to commission sumptuous vintage-inspired posters by Seattle design firm Invisible Creature has firmly placed space travel back where it belongs: in the imagination of travellersIt is particularly fitting that the Nasa commission went to Don and Ryan Clark, who have been running Invisible Creature since 2006, undertaking projects for the likes of Nike and TargetWe were ecstatic, just because our grandfather was an illustrator at Nasa for 30 years, says ClarkThe artwork harks back to the Jet Age-era posters commissioned by Howard Hughes\u0027 Trans World Airlines and its rival United in the 1950s and 1960s, when the work of David Klein (for TWA) and Stan Galli (for United) glamorised and essentially branded this new age of air travelIt doesn\u0027t matter that Nasa has no plans for a Grand Tour of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune and UranusIf global travel is for daydreamers, going beyond the atmosphere is for true space cadetsThe two spacecrafts will be very well prepared for finding the plume if they do: they will be carrying a whole host of instruments that will be perfect for coming to understand whether the strange world would have the ability to host alien life. They will also be carrying radars that can see down beneath the ice to help us learn more about where the plume is coming from – and also about the mysterious watery world that it is erupting up and out of.“Habitable conditions require a certain balance of chemical elements: on Earth, life doesn’t want it to be too acidic, too alkaline, though there are a range of conditions in which life could potentially exist,” says Leigh Fletcher, senior research fellow in planetary science at the University of Leicester.“The more favourable it is, the more likely it is they would be there.”We’ve already had a go at some of this, on Enceladus, where we were able to detect the so-called building blocks of life. Such a discovery doesn’t prove there is aliens hiding in our own solar system, but it does suggest they could be.The time around, on Europa, we’re going to get an even better look.“The Cassini mission was able to characterise in exquisite detail what is happening on Enceladus,” says Fletcher. “I would say that has been our testing ground, with a spacecraft that was based on 1980s, 1990s technology.“Now we know what we’re looking for in the Europa environment. It’s been a fantastically useful thing.”He adds: “One wonders if we ever went out to Saturn and Neptune, with their icy moons, would we be able to see these plumes? These places are barely explored.“It shows that this geophysical activity – this activity in a place where you would expect it to be dead – is happening, and things are changing, today.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I happily pay £40 a year for MoT safety check on my classic.Motor journalist Jonny Smith, who posts videos on Twitter as @carpervert, also opposes extending the exemption, which previously applied only to cars built before 1960.“I don’t think it’s a good idea,” he said. “It’s a good time to familiarise yourself with a car – sometimes you don’t know what jobs need doing, you need a second opinion.”The Department of Transport said the effect on road safety was “small” and claimed that there was no specific evidence of any risk from vehicles of historic interest.“The government gave significant consideration to the issue of any potential impact on rates of death and serious injury on the road,” said the Department of Transport.“The MOT failure rate and the number of people killed and seriously injured in accidents involving vehicles over 40 years old are both lower than those for newer vehicles.“We consider the element of risk arising from taking vehicles over 40 years old out of the testing regime is small.”The new MOT rules are also expected to increase confusion because of the lengthy list of exemptions and caveats.If classic cars have been “substantially changed” then the exemption does not apply – unless original parts are no longer available or the alterations were made to improve efficiency and safety.The exemptions also do not apply to older buses and commercial vehicles over 3.5 tonnes.The new MOT is here! Check here for details – https:t.coE1ZMKAbpb6 pic.twitter1JrrXqubY5Other changes to the MOT coming into force on 20 May mean that diesel vehicles will fail if smoke of any colour comes from the exhaust.Faults will now be categorised as either dangerous (fail), major (fail) or minor (pass), with new checks for tyre pressure, brake fluid, brake pads, headlight washers, and reversing and daytime running lights.There have also been some changes to the annual test for heavy goods vehicles, with the removal of exemptions for mobile cranes, breakdown vehicles, tower wagons and road construction vehicles.Motorists can be fined up to £1,000 for driving without a valid MOT.RAC spokesman Simon Williams said: “It is important everyone quickly gets to grips with the changes to the MOT, and that test centres and garages do a good job of explaining the new fault categories so motorists understand correctly the severity of faults with their vehicles.“Changes to the MOT that make vehicles using our roads safer are undoubtedly a positive step so we hope that testers everywhere interpret and apply the new rules fairly and consistently. The last thing we want to see is a lowering of MOT standards and an increase in the number of unroadworthy vehicles on our roads.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

You\u0027ve said it?Barry Gardiner describes key part of Labour\u0027s Brexit plan as b******s”Which Barry Gardiner is the truth? The one that speaks in private or the one that is on television now?“Mr Gardiner added: “Sometimes you have conversations in private, and the reason they are held in private is because you can advance thinking and you can actually then try and, if all you ever do is stick by the given line, you\u0027d never actually advance it because you\u0027d never discuss anything with people - that\u0027s the reason for holding things in private.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWorkers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

itself obliged to apply post-Brexit fisheries duties on one of the UK\u0026rsquos most consumed fish if the Cabinet failed to sign a free trade deal with some EU countries.Addressing the report as the work of \u0026ldquoRemain minded academics trying to manipulate facts to fit a Remain theory, Fishing For Leave said the research is majorly flawed, as it does not consider the benefits the UK will have from leaving the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP).Fishing for Leave official Alan Hastings said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the EU the UK receives only nine percent of English Channel cod catch limits when based on most catches being in British waters it should be around 70 percent.\u0026ldquoLeaving the CFP would see Britain free to reclaim 3,683 tons of cod, worth approximately \u0026pound32million of processed fish.\u0026nbsp                Scottish MEP rips into \u0027oppressive\u0027 EU Fisheries CommissionerAlan Hastings, Fishing for LeaveThese figures are based on catch distribution and 2018 resource limits and prices.Leaving the CFP with or without a deal will have a major impact on British families, but not the negative one foreseen by Rabobank, said Mr Hastings.He said: \u0026ldquoNot only does Brexit mean repatriating resources to supply more of our own fish but Britain will be free to implement her own more sustainable discard free policy allowing much of the discarded fish to be landed.\u0026ldquoRepatriating our resources and fit-for-purpose management could comfortably see British cod catches double to around 35,000 tons, worth approximately \u0026pound72million as catches and \u0026pound300million as processed.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Fishing for Leave dismissed claims Brits will be subjected to tariffs on imports of codThe huge demand for cod was built before the 1970s, when Nordic nations \u0026ldquotook back control of their 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zones while the UK gave it up to enter the EU.The Rabobank report, called \u0026lsquoFishing for Answer II\u0026rsquo, presented a series of catastrophic effects brought by Brexit to the European fishing industry and Britain.Claiming a hard Brexit \u0026ldquowould likely see Britain\u0026rsquos fish and chip shops increase consumer prices to cover their own rising costs and the research said tariffs placed on imports of cod would range between 7.5 per cent to 18 per cent after March 2019.Rabobank animal protein analyst Beyhan De Jong said: In the event of a hard Brexit, we would see tariffs imposed on fish imports, which would likely see Britain\u0027s fish and chip shops increase consumer prices to cover their own rising costs.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s feared the UK\u0026rsquos transition deal with the European Union will leave the its fishing industry at the

says FFLAn ocean of uncertainty awaits the UK\u0027s seafood industry should it fail to negotiate trade deals with its neighbours.Mr Hastings said: \u0026ldquoDomestic demand for our cod as part of our national dish has, and always will surpass, our comparatively small stocks around the British isles but taking back control can substantially boost domestic supply.\u0026ldquoThe idea that any British government would freely punish consumers enjoyment of our national dish by applying an 18 per cent tariff on supplementary imports of cod from our cod rich Nordic neighbours is absolute

for a debate on Scotland\u0026rsquos future based on \u0026ldquoambition and hope.The commission, chaired by former SNP MSP Andrew Wilson, was set up in 2016 to look at economic policy options for an independent Scotland. It will make recommendations on monetary policy as well as the range of transitional cost and benefits associated with independence.Reports have suggested the commission will back the creation of a Scottish currency.Asked about the timing of a second independence referendum, Ms Sturgeon told ITV\u0026rsquos Peston on Sunday: \u0026ldquoOnce we get some clarity, which hopefully we will in the autumn, about the Brexit outcome and the future relationship between the UK and the EU then I will consider again this question of the timing of an independence referendum.

But of course over the next couple of weeks we will, I suppose, restart a debate about why independence for Scotland is an opportunity and what those opportunities are.As you know we\u0026rsquove had a growth commission looking at the economic opportunities of independence.\u0026ldquoIts report will be published in the coming days and I think that\u0026rsquos quite an important moment, because if you think about the last couple of years in the UK it has been very much a debate about how we cope with the damage of Brexit.\u0026ldquoWhat I think Scotland now has the opportunity to do is look at how we seize the opportunities that lie ahead \u0026ndash so a debate based very much on ambition and hope, not a debate that\u0026rsquos based on despair which is how the Brexit debate so often feels.The nationalist chief always has plenty to say                     1 of 10\u0027Men - the colour of their tie is the most difficult decision they have to make every day\u0027Ms Sturgeon repeated her assertion that the SNP would not be a block to a second referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal, and said there was still time for the UK and Scottish governments to secure an agreement on vital Brexit legislation after the Scottish Parliament voted to withhold consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove set out clearly what that would require and if the Westminster government has the will to reach an agreement then certainly it can be done, she said.The Growth Commission\u0026rsquos report is expected to propose a gradual move towards a new Scottish currency in the event of an independence vote. The Commission\u0026rsquos plan would see Scotland continue to use the pound on the day of separation but on an unofficial basis. There would then be a transition period to a new Scottish currency, pegged to sterling.\u0026nbspScottish Tory finance spokesman Murdo Fraser MSP said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP Growth Commission has always been more about promoting independence than it was about growing the economy.\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoTherefore it is no surprise that Nicola Sturgeon is using this report to begin another push for indyref2.\u0026ldquoThe plan to create a Scottish pound is wholly unworkable, and would be deeply damaging to our businesses trading with the rest of the UK.Labour economy spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: \u0026ldquoThe SNP\u0026rsquos Growth Commission is expected to reboot the economic case for independence.

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime. And he was acquitted along with the others.But Scott maintains Thorpe wanted him dead and said he only felt safe when the politician died in 2014.His younger self has been played by actor Ben Wishaw in the new BBC drama starring Hugh Grant called Very English Scandal."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407176519.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"diana legacy prince harry meghan markle","story":"He followed her around the world, and watched her blossom into both a style icon and an international megastar who changed the face of the royal family for ever.Harry recently said there’s not a day goes by when he doesn’t think about Diana, and it’s a reminder of the enormity of his loss - he was 12 years old when she died.If we want a reminder of how young he was, we just have to look at those heartbreaking pictures of him placing flowers outside Buckingham Palace and walking behind her coffin.It’s also easy to forget just how young Diana was when she was in the public eye – she was only 36 when she died, the same age Meghan is now as she embarks on royal life.By contrast, Diana grew up in front of us really, and in my opinion she became probably one of the greatest women of the 20th century.From the very beginning she broke the mould, bringing real compassion to the sick and the frail.Let’s not forget that she almost single-handedly took the stigma out of AIDS by holding the hands of HIV patients, and in the years before she died she was campaigning against landmines.Today, when I see William and Harry with the young or the sick or the old I see her influence at work.They are caring, they give people time, they look them in the eye and they make them feel important - and I think that comes from Diana.She was a fashion icon too: you could not miss an engagement with Diana because you never knew what she would come out with.She loved putting her own personal twist on things:  one day she would have a choker round her head, the next a pearl necklace down her back. Veils, polka dots, puff sleeves, she was always trying new things.Would she have liked Meghan? I think so.She’d have run her eye up and down her because although she wasn’t the sharpest tool in the box academia-wise, she had an A+ in intuition, but the important thing to her would be to know that she loved her son.If you could show her that then that would have been enough.If Diana was alive today I’ve no doubt she would be heavily involved with Meghan and Catherine and her grandchildren – and she would have been a very fun grandma.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She got her Brexit inner Cabinet to agree that in the event of no trade deal being in place by December 2020, the UK would continue to apply the EU’s common external tariff.The decision goes back to the issue of the Irish border and the “backstop” May agreed last December. This said that in the event of no deal being done, the UK would keep Northern Ireland in line with EU rules on customs, agriculture and manufactured goods.The DUP, the Ulster party on which Mrs May depends for her Commons majority, would never accept a Northern Ireland-only deal. So the Government wants to apply this backstop to the whole UK.The situation is far from ideal. It shows why the Brexit Secretary, David Davis, was right to have such misgivings about the backstop. He argued that by agreeing what would happen in the event of ‘no deal’ the UK was reducing its negotiating leverage.There is also a danger the backstop reduces the EU’s incentive to negotiate a comprehensive free-trade deal.Brexiteer ministers are intrigued by new Home Secretary Sajid Javid’s idea of keeping the customs revenues collected under the backstop in trust, only handing them over to the EU once the final deal is done.The UK’s position in these talks has been weakened by its failure to properly prepare for no deal.The EU knows the UK isn’t ready to walk away so it keeps pushing, knowing the need for a deal means we will almost certainly fold in the end.The final problem is that the UK still doesn’t know precisely what it wants. The backstop is only meant to apply if either a trade deal or technology can’t solve the Irish border problem.But right now there is more agreement in the Brexit inner Cabinet on the backstop — which, officially, they don’t want to happen — than on either of those two options.I understand from those involved in ministerial working groups looking at customs options they are still a long way off any conclusions. I am also told these working groups aren’t coming up with answers but doing “preparatory work to inform a later discussion”.So why aren’t Brexiteers kicking off at all these cans been kicked down the road?Well, as one influential figure, explains to me: “It is all very unsatisfactory but it is what it is.” In other words, given the mistakes that have been made, there isn’t really an alternative.The other reason is the view among several of the most important Brexiteers that they can’t get what they want at the moment, so they should play it long. The thinking goes that it is better to accept more temporary measures than to agree to bad permanent arrangements.But it is being whispered in Westminster that if Brexiteers are to get what they want, they need control of the government machine — and that means one of their own in Number 10.Moving against Theresa May now is simply too risky.Bringing her down could bring Brexit down.But in the past week, the talk of a challenge to her shortly after Britain has legally, if not practically, left the EU has risen in volume.Those around Mrs May want her to fight the next election.They also argue that any leadership contest before the whole Brexit process is done would risk splitting the Tories beyond repair.But this week, the chances of a challenge to Mrs May soon after March 30 next year substantially increased.ALL eyes will be on Windsor today for the Royal Wedding – but in Westminster, Tories are getting increasingly excited about the possibility of some political nuptials.On Monday night, the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove will launch a new group designed to craft a post-Brexit agenda for the party. This joint appearance has set tongues wagging and left Tories wondering if they could one day be joined in political union.Davidson and Gove were on opposite sides of the Brexit referendum and until recently, she was – in private – no fan of his. But that has changed.One ally of hers tells me: “Relations are warmer than they have ever been.” What has brought them together? Fish. Davidson knows it is politically vital for Scottish Tories to secure a clean break from the Common Fisheries Policy.And Gove, whose adopted father was an Aberdeen fish merchant, is an ally against Chancellor Philip Hammond’s desire to use fishing as a bargaining chip in the negotiations.The question is whether this alliance of convenience could develop into something more lasting. Many Tories still dream of Davidson coming south after the Scottish Parliament elections in 2021. They think her charisma, combined with Gove’s radicalism, would be just the ticket.But there are huge logistical challenges to getting Davidson to Westminster before the next election, even if she wanted to. So could she back Gove?I am told she is keeping her options open at the moment. But what is certain is that whoever she did back would get a massive boost.If Davidson is not going to try to be queen, she can be the Tory kingmaker.So one wonders what Bercow, the Speaker of the House, would say about a minister calling someone a “stupid woman”.Yet tellingly, his office’s statement doesn’t deny the claim that he called Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, that in a private aside on Wednesday.But there are no signs of a public apology from Bercow.It is hard not to conclude that he is determined to hang on to his job whatever damage he does to the role.ITALY, one of the founding members of the EU, is set to be governed by a populist coalition who want to renegotiate key parts of the European project.The biggest threat the new Italian government poses is to the future of the Eurozone. The new coalition’s programme would cost more than 100billion euros. This will put them in breach of the Eurozone’s deficit rules. To add insult to injury, the European Central Bank (ECB) buys a substantial amount of Italy’s sovereign debt.So the ECB would effectively be financing part of this programme.The result will be a backlash in northern European countries. They will wonder why Italy should get away with this. The result: The prospect of proper reform to fix the Eurozone’s structural weaknesses is dead.This is the Eurozone’s problem. Politics makes the reforms it needs impossible. Next time a global financial crisis hits, the Eurozone will have unique vulnerabilities.She said Tory MPs were telling her that both the party and the country needed unity at this moment and noises off didn’t help with that.But I am told the Prime Minister’s appeals on this front are becoming so frequent they are losing their force.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Both sides want a deal. But if the EU also tries to cripple us as a trading power, there are 60 Brexit-backing Tories ready to veto it.The PM has made many concessions to the EU already. She must be more militant.WHY is the grotesquely self-important toad John Bercow still Commons Speaker?For years he has polluted proceedings with his verbose grandstanding, interrupting MPs to rebuke them at tedious length for some minor transgression.His endless convoluted put-downs take up precious debating time.Bercow already faces two bullying accusations which he denies and MPs strangely do not wish to probe.Now, after yet another unhinged rant, he seems to have branded Andrea Leadsom “a stupid woman”.

We have become one family, just like we would have been when they got married. We know that would make them so happy.”Holding Caroline’s hand Chloe’s mum Lisa added: “They were the perfect couple and had their entire future mapped out.“They were so excited about moving in together this year and taking their first foreign holiday together to Spain to celebrate Chloe’s birthday in August.“Two years later they were going to get married then two years after that they said they would have children.“They were so mature and in love we were absolutely certain they were doing the right thing.“We feel fortunate they had already experienced and achieved so much during their lives.“They had the type of love most people spend a lifetime searching for and were completely inseparable.“I truly believe they were destined to be together. They were so similar we sometimes get confused which one we are talking about.”The couple, who had been together for three years, had huge dreams.Chloe, who was studying music at Newcastle College and had auditioned on X Factor, wanted to be a singer or a music teacher and Liam, who was studying sports science at Northumbria University, loved playing cricket.Both worked part time at the Hilton hotel in Gateshead, where a special ball will be held in their honour next month.Their dreams were cut short by the terrorist who targeted innocents leaving the concert.This week police revealed that more than 800 people are now known to have suffered physical and psychological injuries after the bombing.Or you can organise you own fundraiser and pass on the money to the trustees.The donation will be used to help aspiring artists and athletes who have been hand-picked by a board of experts.For details go to the Facebook page – facebook/ChloeAndLiamTogetherForever/.Speaking from the Rutherfords’ home in South Shields, South Tyneside, where the walls are adorned with heart-shaped photographs of the couple, the mums explained they did not want to talk about the extremist who committed the atrocity.Caroline said: “We want to concentrate on Chloe and Liam and all the joy they brought into the world — and the legacy we can build for them now.”Lisa added: “Chloe had been a huge fan of Ariana ever since she appeared on the American TV show Victorious.“She couldn’t believe it when she found out she was playing a concert so close to home. She was very excited to see her perform.”The families now want to look to the future, and are devoting their own lives to helping the stars of tomorrow.They have set up the Chloe and Liam Together Forever Trust to provide support to talented youngsters as they explore their passions in music and sport. Lisa explained: “Liam and Chloe’s dreams were stolen from them before they could make them come true. They were born to be together and we want to do everything we can to ensure their love lives on for evermore.”Chloe’s dad Mark, 47, a former confectionery worker and Lisa, 47, a former banker, have joined forces with Caroline, 47, to run the trust.They have also helped Caroline cope with the loss of both her son and his dad, Andrew, who died of cancer, aged 49, just a short time before the attack.Lisa said: “After Liam and Chloe died we were overwhelmed with how many people contacted us offering to raise or donate money in their honour.“Even strangers were messaging us saying they wanted to do something. We wanted to do something with all that generosity and the idea for the trust came to us almost straight away.“So we are raising money to help promising musicians and athletes of any age.“The amount we donate varies but we are already helping a talented ballet dancer with his tuition fees and we are also funding a talented archer so he can buy the equipment he needs.“The dream is that one day we will help someone perform at a West End show in London, or compete for a gold medal at the Olympics.“We are trying to help the stars of tomorrow realise their goals and do the things my daughter and Liam would have liked to do. We’re in a position that the kids are never forgotten and although their ambitions were torn away from them, somebody else’s children will hopefully be able to fulfil their potential — and that’s because of Chloe and Liam.“Chloe had such a pure and beautiful voice. She loved singing and would perform at events all the time.“She would have loved to have been on the big stage one day but she also wanted to become a music teacher.“That’s why we really want to turn this terrible tragedy into something positive.”On Tuesday hundreds of locals in South Shields will wear the trust’s colours of pink and blue as they gather next to the permanent memorial bench in the couple’s honour next to the Town Hall.Mark said: “It’s hard to describe what we’ve been through. There are days when you don’t want to get out of bed because you feel you have got nothing to get up for.“Sometimes you don’t want to leave the house and you can’t do anything but sit and cry.“But the trust has given us the strength we need to carry on.“It’s become a full-time job dealing with everything that goes with it and we know that Liam and Chloe would be so proud of us for what we are doing.“That is what keeps us going and what makes it worth getting out of bed in the morning — knowing that despite this tragedy we can bring some good into the world.”A BRAVE band of terror attack survivors are calling on the public to help them combat extremism.The group, which includes people caught up in the Manchester Arena atrocity, say more must be done to “take on the evil” that has claimed so many lives.In an open letter, members including Becky Rigby, 35 – the widow of soldier Lee Rigby, who was murdered on a London street in May 2013 – issue a clarion call on how to stop the extremists before they strike.The group say: “With just two days to go until the anniversary of the Manchester Arena attack, which also marks the murder five years ago of Fusilier Lee Rigby, we would like to ask the public, as well as honouring those we have lost, to think about how you can become part of the solution to terror.“We are a group of survivors of terrorism. Some of us were injured ourselves, others have lost loved ones. In all cases, the scars of those moments are deep.“As we know from our own experience, terrorists have targeted the innocent regardless of faith, ethnicity or politics, for generations.“Our members have lost loved ones to nationalists, Islamists and far-right extremists.“What binds these extremists together is not any particular belief.“It is the hatred of people not like them and the willingness to use violence against innocent civilians.“It is this we must take on and defeat. When terror hits, we all feel an impotent rage. We all want to help the victims and take on the evil that drives the attacks – but how?”The letter is signed by more than 40 relatives of terror victims who have lost loved ones to groups including IS and the IRA.Signatories include Dan Hett, whose brother Martyn, 29, died in the Manchester Arena attack, and Gina Van Dort, 32, who was shot in the face and lost her husband Chris Dyer, 32, in the Tunisian beach attack of 2015.Their aims include:Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There is more to be done. One wedding will not change that.But yesterday we saw a Britain, and a Royal Family, that has moved into a new era.Princess Diana would have loved it.Nothing would have amused her more than how unconventional some parts of the ceremony were, or pleased her more than the number of hard-working charity staff who were invited to join in.The forget-me-nots in Meghan’s bouquet, Diana’s favourite flower, were a touching tribute. The Queen looked at once the distinguished Head of State we are used to and a doting grandmother.This was Britain’s biggest moment on the global stage since the opening of the London Olympics.Just as we did that night, yesterday we revelled in our heritage but announced that we were looking forward to an even brighter future.We wish the Duke and Duchess of Sussex the happiest of lives together.Here’s to them and our Great Britain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could easily have become trapped in the web of regal traditions.But Meghan navigated the intricacies with aplomb to pull off the most contemporary and delightfully multi-cultural royal wedding Britain has ever seen.There was a gospel choir, a bride’s mother with a nose stud and a star-studded guest list that was far more Soho House than Buck House. And of course, the aforementioned preacher Michael Curry.He milked his moment at the pulpit with a relentlessly repetitive call to love that went on . . . and on . . . and on, and clearly tickled some royals so much they looked fit to burst.The younger, modernising royals are now regarded more as celebrities than figureheads and this was a highly public melding of the old and new.After all Meghan, 36, is a divorcee with life experience, not some privileged ingenue straight out of finishing school.In Suits, the US telly series she starred in, her character married in a dress Meghan herself chose and described as “classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for”.The same could be said of yesterday’s creation by British designer Clare Waight Keller.In a nod to history, Meghan topped it with Queen Mary’s 1932 diamond bandeau tiara.And her “glam squad” of make-up artists, hairdresser, eyebrow shaper and skin guru worked their magic to accentuate a naturally radiant glow without looking overdone.She walked into the chapel alone, a break with form spun as a “bold, feminist statement” but really borne from sad necessity by her father’s absence.Meghan passed her Suits co-stars and the majority of the other celebrity guests in the Nave — what might be described as the cheap seats. Even Patrick J Adams, who played Suits love interest Mike Ross, was there.Yet curiously, celebrity royalty George and Amal Clooney were placed in the Quire alongside the Royal Family. Go figure.As Meghan reached halfway, she took the arm of her now father-in-law Prince Charles.He was to “accompany” her to the altar, rather than “give away” the woman who, let’s face it, he’s only just getting to know. For Charles the last-minute role was perhaps a godsend, placing him centre stage where the presence of his ever-strong mother might have eclipsed him.Not to mention the ghost of his ex-wife, always painted as the touch-feely parent to his seemingly more remote style.For, although it’s been 20 years since Diana’s death, how could anyone in the same situation not think of their mother and muse and how she would have savoured being there?And how could even the ­hardest of Republican hearts not have felt a small pang of regret she wasn’t?After all, in the middle of it all was the very human story of a young man who stole the nation’s hearts when forced to walk behind his mother’s coffin at the tender age of 12.On his engagement, Harry was asked what Diana would have thought of Meghan. He smiled and said: “They would have been thick as thieves. I think she would have been over the moon — jumping up and down, so excited for me, but then, as I said, she would have probably been best friends with Meghan.”Indeed she would. Diana always took great pains to make sure her sons knew not everyone’s life was as privileged.So she would have adored Harry’s choice of bride for her normality and independence.He could have had his pick of socialites but he chose a normal woman who has grafted and earned everything she has.The downside is that, unlike poshies who are as badly behaved as the rest of us but keep it to themselves, Meghan’s unedited life is ripe for scrutiny.Diana would have understood and done her utmost to support her. In addition, the media-savvy Princess of Wales would have brought Meghan’s father into the fold weeks ago, knowing a mix of estranged family and lack of disposable income is a potentially damaging cocktail.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKBut all that was forgotten yesterday as Meghan’s 61-year-old mother Doria Ragland, a yoga teacher, watched her daughter (who she calls “flower”) from a front-row pew, compellingly regal in her solitude.Meghan is reportedly maternal herself apparent during their engagement interview, throughout which she guides Harry rather than the other way round.In Angela Levin’s book Harry: Conversations with the Prince, she quotes historian Dr David Starkey as saying: “She mothers him a bit, but he needs it and some women like to do it.”Harry says his mother’s death left him in total chaos and Levin feels his “air of vulnerability and sadness” has brought out Meghan’s mothering instinct.Good. In return, it’s plain to see she has Harry’s unconditional devotion, and that they’ll make fine parents.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Everybody was clapping because it was the first time he was using that term for Meghan so it was really nice.”The second in line to the throne is said to have acted as compere and introduced both his father, Prince Charles, and his brother.Those that heard the speech are remaining very tight-lipped although by all accounts Prince William’s speech was “naughty”.Prince Williams speech was seen very much as payback for Harrys hilarious tribute to William and Kate when they tied the knot.The bride and groom danced the night away with Harrys favourite House tracks and Elton John on the piano while guests tucked into dirty burgers and candyfloss.These were washed down with a cocktail featuring ginger and rum named When Harry Met Meghan in an apparent nod to Harrys red hair at the bash at Frogmore House hosted by Prince Charles.James Corden also played a surprise role as compere at the evening reception in a £300,000 glass marquee in the grounds of Windsor Castle as a firework display rounded off the night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot.

In an excruciating interview Labour\u0027s shadow international trade secretary was forced to listen to a recording of himself at a private event rubbishing his party\u0027s policy.  It caused controversy at the time because he was directly contradicting Labour Party policy.  And other cabinet colleagues have lost their jobs for making the same error.   His former colleague Owen Smith , who was Northern Ireland Secretary, was sacked after penning an article calling for Britain to stay in the Single Market.   Filling in for Andrew Marr, Emma Barnett today asked him if he was grateful to Jeremy Corbyn for sparing him the chop despite him contradicting Labour\u0027s policy.    Gardiner is recorded ridiculing one of Labour\u0027s six tests for a Brexit deal which is that it achieves the exact same benefits as the current relationship with the EU.  On the recording he can be heard saying: “It’s b*****ks. Always has been b*****ks” – and goes on to dismiss the whole strategy of the six tests. “We know very well that we cannot have the exact same benefits. And it would have made sense, because it was the Tories that said they were going to secure the exact same benefits, and our position should have been precisely to say: ‘They have said that they will secure the exact same benefits and we are going to hold them to that standard.’”  Today he said: Our policy is that we will hold the government to account for the promises they made.  When he was quizzed whether he stood by previous comments that people were playing up the issue of security in Ireland, he failed to commit. And he appeared to admit he said different things in private to public.

But it reminded some of one of his grandfather\u0027s famous gaffes.  The 96-year-old Prince Philip, who is still recovering from a hip operation he underwent roughly six weeks ago, was at the ceremony at St George\u0027s Chapel to see Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle in a lavish and beautiful ceremony.  The Duke of Edinburgh is perhaps most famous for his history of gaffes and inappropriate remarks. Although he is thought to have been on his best behaviour alongside the Queen yesterday, that hasn\u0027t stopped one of his earlier remarks being dragged up again.

In this case the woman was certainly a new wife and the car, while originally manufactured in 1968, has since been converted to electric power. The car is a concept model and the licence plate has a secret meaning.

Speaking to the Sunday Times , one of the couple\u0027s friends said Harry told Meghan: I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you and said we make such a good team.  He also paid tribute to how Meghan has dealt with the extremely difficult week leading up to her wedding, which saw her dad drop out of the wedding to undergo heart surgery.  He also spoke about Meghan\u0027s mum Doria Ragland .   It was Harry\u0027s second speech of the day, as he also said a few words off the cuff during the earlier lunchtime reception .  Prince Charles also gave a speech and spoke about raising Prince Harry, making jokes about changing his nappy. The bride also spoke, but little is known about what she said.  The newlyweds had two wedding receptions - the first a formal sit down meal hosted by the Queen at St George\u0027s Hall, and the second a more laid back party hosted by Prince Charles. The fun evening reportedly had a carnival theme with music from celeb DJ am Totolee and a huge fireworks display. Guests tucked into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss and drank themed cocktails - including one named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, a play on the hit romantic comedy When Harry Met Sally.

Grace, now 16, avoided the bomb blast that killed 22. But Gaynor and Michael, of Dukinfield, in Tameside, were in its path. Gaynor, 48, suffered terrible injuries. Michael, 60, was left partially deaf. Grace told her mum she feels guilty they were hurt, not her. Here, Gaynor responds.. My darling Grace, I know you feel guilty about what happened that horrific night on May 22. I know you feel guilty that me and your dad were in the foyer waiting for you and suffered the full brunt of the blast. But I want to tell you, my darling little girl, that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, I am forever grateful that it was me rather than you in that foyer, that it’s me who suffered the awful injuries and who saw the aftermath. It looked like a war zone. That image will never leave me and I am so thankful that you never had to see what I saw. The sight, and unforgettably awful sounds, of that night are still vivid but, instead of remembering the moment that destroyed so much, I try to recall the good and happiness beforehand.  I remember driving you and your friend to the concert and you were so excited, singing Ariana Grande songs. We dropped you off in the foyer and told you the spot next to the merchandise stall where I’d wait when you got out. You’d put on your new Ariana hoodie from one of the stalls. I remember you saying you were so excited you felt sick. Once we made sure you were OK, me and your dad had a meal in Manchester city centre then, later, I popped in to pick you up while he waited in the car. It was so busy. All the mums were chatting, some parents were dancing. Other mums were taking little girls out crying because they didn’t want to leave the concert before the end. I look back and think, “Thank God they left early”.  Then, around 10.20pm, I felt a tap on my shoulder and there was your dad. He’d come in to see if I was OK. I wish he had stayed in the car because, the next minute, it was total carnage. It was a noise I’d never heard before, so sharp, a sudden bang. I knew it was a bomb straight away. I felt an intense heat and flames flicking around my neck. Your dad had been blasted away from me but I could see him lying unconscious with his eyes open. I saw his eyes fix on me. I thought, “He’s dead”. As you know, Dad is a big 6ft fella and with all my might I pushed him up, shouting, “Michael, Michael!”. I was desperate for him to come round and eventually he did. Then I looked around. I don’t have words to describe what I saw. It was as if time had stood still. My brain could not absorb what I was seeing.  I am just so thankful that you never saw what I did, Grace, and you don’t suffer the same terrible flashbacks. My neck felt really hot and my legs were really cold. I knew something was wrong but all I could think about was you and how I was going to find you. I was hysterical, screaming your name. I thought, “If I scream loud enough, she’ll hear me”. All I could do was remind myself you had front row seats and hope desperately it meant you weren’t near the blast. I thought another bomb was going off. I was screaming to your dad that we had to get out. The next 45 minutes were the longest of my life. All the phones were down, we had no idea where you were.  I was frantic. Then a woman who helped you found my number in your phone and rang me to tell me you were safe at the cathedral. Seeing you and hugging you in that moment felt unreal, it was like being in a film. I cried, screamed and hugged you. I was so relieved and you sobbed in my arms. You wouldn’t stop clinging to me. Once I knew you were safe, I started to realise how bad my injuries were. At that moment I turned to your dad and said, “Michael, I really hurt”. And he said, “I know”. He rushed us to Tameside Hospital, where I was told by doctors I am the luckiest person to be alive.  Shrapnel had hit my neck, causing burns that spread to my face. It also pierced my hip bone, down my leg and through my back. If that piece of shrap\u0026shy\u0026shynel hadn’t hit my hip bone, I’d be dead. As you know, it’s been a long and slow recovery. I am still in a lot of pain in my leg and I had to get a graft on my neck, because the scar haunted me. It was the first thing I saw when I looked in the mirror and became a constant reminder of what happened to all those people. It must’ve been a reminder to you, too. But I am so grateful you haven’t had to go through the same pain as me, Grace. My confidence was completely shattered. We were all set to open my new dog parlour shop before the attack but I couldn’t face it for five months. But I had to make myself get on for you, Grace. I know you won’t talk to me about that night. You have refused counselling, unlike me and your dad, and you say you are fine whenever I ask you.  I know you didn’t want to come back to the Arena with us, which the counsellors said might help with the trauma. And it was tough. We saw the spot where your dad stood and there is a huge slab of concrete totally destroyed right next to where his head was. But I think of us as the luckiest people in the world. I know you have your online forum with some of the other girls there that night and I really hope you find comfort in speaking to them. Please remember, Grace, that I am so proud of you. What you have achieved since then is fantastic. The day after the attack, I was in surgery and your teachers at school told you to go home. I can’t begin to imagine what you were going through. But instead of going home, you sat your GCSE textiles exam. I couldn’t believe it when your dad told me. And you got an amazing grade B.

Twitter was awash with speculation on Saturday that the new Duchess of Sussex failed to show the respectful gesture to the 92-year-old monarch during the service in St George\u0027s Chapel. But new footage shows the 36-year-old did curtsy in a blink-and-you\u0027ll-miss-it moment. But TV crews decided that exact moment to cut to a wide angle shot and it was missed. Eagle-eyed fans who looked closely at the footage from the ceremony were able to spot the brief curtsy.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were wed yesterday in an extravagant and diverse ceremony which was watched across the world. The couple tied the knot at a packed St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor with thousands of fans lining the streets of the royal borough town to celebrate the historic occasion. Meghan, who wore a stunning white Givenchy dress, has bent her knee to the monarch in the past.  But fans were quick to question if the occasion had got the best of Meghan and she forgot to curtsy as she left the chapel. Simone tweeted: Fellow British friends, can someone tell why Meghan didn’t curtsy to the Queen? George Whitsett wrote: Wasn’t Meghan supposed to curtsy the queen before leaving the church? Monicia Warner added: Any idea why there was no curtsy to the Queen?

Instead, she decided to have lots of adorable children bridesmaids and page boys who all seemed to love their moment in the spotlight.

And Clooney, 57, also danced with the Duchess of Cambridge at the star-studded event in Windsor’s Frogmore House. But one of the world’s the sexiest men did not get his own way with all the women – Fergie snubbed him when he asked her to dance, much to the \u0026shyamusement of other guests.  Meghan’s dog Guy also had \u0026shyrevellers in fits as it caused chaos by running around the hall lapping up spilled food. Earlier, the couple declared their love for each other in short speeches.  Harry told friends: “You are the people that make ‘me’ me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. “Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half…” Meghan ended her emotional speech by declaring: “I have found my prince.” She is also understood to have thanked the royals for welcoming her into the “firm” and her close friends for supporting her in the last few weeks. The couple chose Whitney Houston’s hit I Wanna Dance With Somebody for their first jive. One of the 200 guests said of the \u0026shyreception: “It wasn’t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop.”   Another added: “As we walked in there were ladies dressed in black, serving us fizz and Pimms, as well as canapes from the  palace staff.  “That bit was a little formal with a bit of a line-up led by Charles and Camilla, with Wills and Kate to one side and Harry and Meghan in the middle of it all.” But the guest told how fun took over formalities once the party got into swing, adding: “It was informal and a lovely atmosphere. “The whole evening had a really chilled, festival vibe.” Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila \u0026shyFoundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour \u0026shyMagazine: “I think everybody thought she looked beautiful. I got to speak to Meghan at the reception, when she and Prince Harry were meeting \u0026shyeverybody one by one. “Even after she has become the Duchess of Sussex, she hasn’t changed. I gave her a hug, I \u0026shycongratulated her.” There were Madame Tussauds waxworks of Meghan and Harry at the event, which followed an earlier reception for all 600 wedding guests. At that event, the prince moved them to tears by saying of his wife: “We make a great team.”  Evening reception guests included David and Victoria Beckham, tennis star Serena Williams, James Corden, Idris Elba, Amal Clooney and actress Priyanka Chopra. Brother and best man William was there with wife Kate as well as Fergie’s daughters Beatrice and Eugenie. Elba is reported to have turned DJ as the wedding group danced to 80s and 90s hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton in South London, hinted that it worked and he secured the commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photo of Windsor with the caption: “Calm before the excitement.” In honour of Harry’s time in the forces, the evening was lubricated by cocktails with military names such as the Apache, the Brimstone, the Rapier and the Hellfire. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan’s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: “How amazing is this? “Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.” Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy, who had been spotted on TV looking glum as he tied the knot, appeared in a better mood at the party. She was all smiles and was even seen embracing Meghan, who wore \u0026shyPrincess Diana’s aquamarine ring. After Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, left, guests were thought to have gone to an “after after party” at London’s Chiltern Firehouse. An insider said: “Harry and Meghan went about midnight, \u0026shyshattered and madly in love.”  But there was still time for a prank by William, who attached a ladder to the couple’s car. The guest said: “Apparently Harry fell off a ladder recently while changing a light bulb for Meghan and hurt his arm. So Wills tied a ladder to the back of the car, which nearly floored a few people.” Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George’s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: “My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles last minute wedding","story":"NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s last minute wedding dress adjustment seconds before walking down the aisleThe choice of dress for the 36-year-old was one of the most anticipated parts of her wedding to Prince Harry\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter15:38, 20 MAY 2018NewsThere were last minute adjustments to the stunning dress (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe designer of Meghan Markle\u0027s spectacular wedding dress has revealed how there were some last minute adjustments just as the bride was revealed to the waiting world. The choice of dress for the 36-year-old former Suits star was one of the most anticipated parts of her wedding to Prince Harry with endless speculation what designer she would choose.  Meghan went with Givenchy\u0027s Claire Waight Keller to design her simple boat-neck wedding dress with three quarter length sleeves, and an intricately embroidered veil which paid tribute to the 53 nations of the Commonwealth .  Birmingham-born mum of three Ms Waight Keller was on hand on the steps to make final adjustments to Meghan\u0027s gown and veil before handing her into the care of the page boys who showed off the 15 ft veil to such effect.  Ms Waight Keller also helped to arrange it before the couple made their exit as husband and wife before that perfect kiss in front of the public. But she said she did not think about the fact the world would be watching: I didn\u0027t really think about it. I was actually just thinking about the dress and the veil. I wanted just for her to feel and look amazing. It was just an important moment to get all of that right and I thought she just looked spectacular. And given how well Meghan wore her dresses, it is no wonder proud Harry sought out Ms Waight Keller to thank her after the ceremony. She revealed: He came straight up to me and he said \u0027oh my God, thank you, she looks absolutely stunning\u0027.  The designer could see Harry was captivated by his bride. She said: Well I think everybody saw on television - he was absolutely in awe I think. She looked just incredible and it showed. She said: I wanted just for her to feel and look amazing. It was just an important moment to get all of that right and I thought she just looked spectacular, she said. Asked if she put much thought into her own outfit, she said: Of course as a designer you always consider how you look. But I also wanted to make sure that I was somewhat invisible as well, that it was her moment, and that\u0027s what was really key. But I wanted her to feel that I was there if she needed me.

The flowers have been placed on the Grave of the Unknown Warrior, which symbolises the sacrifices made by British troops at war. This is a tradition which was begun by HM Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, following her marriage to King George VI. The flowers were placed there in memory of the bride\u0027s brother Fergus, who was killed in 1915 at the Battle of Loos during the First World War. The bouquet was designed by florist Philippa Craddock and comprises sweet pea forget-me-not, lily of the valley, astilbe, jasmine, astrantia and myrtle.  The tradition of carrying myrtle begun after Queen Victoria was given a nosegay containing myrtle by Prince Albert’s grandmother during a visit to Gotha in Germany. In the same year, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert bought Osborne House as a family retreat, and a sprig from the posy was planted against the terrace walls, where it continues to thrive today. The myrtle was first carried by Queen Victoria eldest daughter, Princess Victoria, when she married in 1858, and was used to signify the traditional innocence of a bride.

Meghan has been granted Leave to Remain, an immigration status which means there\u0027s no time limit on her stay in the country and she\u0027s allowed to work and study without any restrictions. However getting citizenship is a bit more complicated.  Kensington Palace has said Meghan will go through the normal visa process like everyone else. A spokesman said: Ms. Markle has taken full legal advice on her right to remain in the UK and will be fully compliant with all requirements at all times. She will go through the normal visa process. Ms. Markle intends to become a British citizen going through the normal process, which will take a number of years.

These include:  You must be over 18 You must be of good character You\u0027ll have to continue living in the UK You\u0027ll have to prove you have a good knowledge of English You must have lived in the UK for five years before the Home Office gets your application.

Climbing the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel, she gave royal fans across the globe their first glimpse of the most anticipated wedding dress in history. The 36-year-old American chose Givenchy\u0027s British artistic director Clare Waight Keller, 47, to design the \u0026pound200,000 ivory-white gown. And the details of their top secret relationship has now been laid bare. Dashing across London in a baseball cap or beanie, Meghan and Clare ran a covert operation in the lead up to the big day.  The commission was so secret, the bride did not go to Paris to visit the French fashion house\u0027s headquarters, but instead met Clare at her Chelsea home. According to reports, Meghan would dress down and dart into the West London flat. The process began in January, when Meghan began looking through sketches with best friend Jessica Mulroney, who runs her own bridal business in Canada. Until yesterday, only five people in the world knew details about the dress - the bride, Jessica, Clare and two discreet assistants at Givenchy. Once a design was decided on, expert seamstresses got to work.  The veil took hundreds of hours to make as seamstresses religiously washed their hands every 30 minutes. The delicate fabric had to be kept pristine and flowers from 53 Commonwealth countries were to feature. The result was a three-quarter length, simple gown with an elegant boat neck and 16ft veil made from silk tulle. The focus of the dress is the graphic open bateau neckline that gracefully frames the shoulders and emphasises the slender sculpted waist, Kensington Palace said in a statement. The lines of the dress extend towards the back where the train flows in soft round folds cushioned by an underskirt in triple silk organza. The slim three-quarter sleeves add a note of refined modernity.  The gown was made of double bonded cady silk with a sweeping train. Edward Enninful, the editor of British Vogue, called the dress beautiful while bridal designer Raishma said the gown was an example of couture design at its most classic and timeless. It was not a Cinderella choice, not one that spoke of fantasy or old-fashioned fairy tales, but one that placed the woman proudly front and center, Vanessa Friedman, fashion director and chief fashion critic at The New York Times, wrote. It underscored Ms. Markle\u0027s own independence by divesting her of frippery, while also respecting tradition and keeping her covered up.  The well-kept secret over who would design the dress had kept royal fans and fashionistas guessing for months. Among the those cited as contenders were labels Ralph \u0026amp Russo and Burberry as well as designer Stella McCartney. Waight Keller, whose name has now been catapulted into the global spotlight, described the chance to work on the historic occasion as an honour.

Rhian Monteith’s simple idea could save the NHS tens of millions of pounds and bosses want it to go UK-wide. The 39-year-old drew up a list of 23 “frequent callers”– many lonely or with mental health problems – who had visited A\u0026ampE 703 times in three months. After a coffee meeting she mentored them, getting them to call her not 999. This cut their A\u0026ampE visits and ambulance call-outs in Blackpool by 90% and Rhian said: “I’m incredibly proud to see how my idea has grown.  “It shows, if you are armed with a phone and a high level of emotional intelligence, the difference you can have to people who need a hand up in life. “Every individual is put in contact with a person who cares about them, and stands with them in their time of need.” The High Intensity User scheme was scaled up to 300 patients in Blackpool over three years, saving \u0026pound2 million. It is now used in a fifth of the country and NHS England wants the rest to follow. In 2016 the cost across the NHS of the estimated 5,000 “frequent callers” – defined as calling five times a month or 12 times in three months – was put at around 3% of spending or \u0026pound53 million.

Prince Harry , who looked nervous as he walked into the chapel with his brother and best man Prince William , appeared to struggle with his emotions as his stunning bride walked up the aisle on her own - with her father too ill to attend.  But the new Duke of Sussex was again overcome with emotion as the touching hymn was sung. The song was performed at Diana\u0027s funeral at Westminster Abbey in 1997, when Prince Harry was just 12 years old.  Last year Harry admitted in a TV documentary he had only cried twice about his mother\u0027s death in a car crash in Paris, an event which shocked the world. He said: The first time I cried was at the funeral on the island, referring to Diana\u0027s private burial at Althorp. And only since then, maybe once more. There\u0027s a lot of grief that still needs to be... to be let out. By Nicola Small and Victoria Murphy Harry and Meghan made sure Princess Diana was not forgotten on their special day. From the flowers in Meghan’s bouquet to the music and the reading at the service, the couple ensured her presence was felt – 21 years after her crash death. The only reading was about the power of eternal love, with Diana’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes, 61, triggering tears as she said from the Old Testament Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins. Also present was former Prime Minister John Major, who was appointed special  to Princes Harry and William, responsible for legal and administrative matters, when Diana died in the Paris underpass. No British or overseas dignitaries were invited to the wedding, so Mr Major’s presence was a reminder of the pivotal role he played in Harry’s life at a traumatic time. When Meghan arrived at St George’s Chapel, she was carrying a bouquet with Diana’s beloved forget-me-nots. The white petals of Diana’s favourite nestled among blooms picked from Kensington Palace gardens and myrtle sprigs, which are traditional in royal bouquets. Adorning the walls of the 500-year-old chapel were arches of flowers, including white roses, another of Diana’s favourites that were planted in her memory at the palace gardens over the summer. As soon as details of the wedding were announced, Harry said he wanted to “celebrate the memory of the late Princess on the wedding day”. Harry was emotional throughout the service and was particularly moved as the congregation sang the final hymn, Guide Me O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Diana’s 1997 funeral. William and Kate also included it their wedding. Given pride of place in the chapel was Diana’s close friend Julia Samuel, with her husband Michael. Julia is godmother to Prince George and has remained close to William and Harry following Diana’s death, with Meghan previously talking about how much she enjoyed meeting her. There were touching references to Harry\u0027s late mother throughout the ceremony. Meghan carried a bouquet containing forget-me-nots, specifically chosen as they were Diana\u0027s favourite flower.  A spokesperson for Kensington Palace said: The couple specifically chose them to be included in Ms Markle\u0027s bouquet to honour the memory of the late Princess on this special day. Diana\u0027s sister Lady Jane Fellowes gave the only reading of the service, the eighth chapter of the Song of Solomon: “My beloved speaks and says to me, ‘Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away for now the winter is past, the rain is over and gone’.” She was joined at the service by Diana’s other sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and her brother Earl Spencer, along with Harry’s Spencer family cousins.

But one of the more unusual facts of the day was on Harry\u0027s face - specifically his beard .   The 33-year-old became the first royal to get married with facial hair for 125 years and he needed special permission from his grandmother, the Queen , to do so.   The last royal to tie the knot sporting face fuzz was George V , the son of Queen Victoria and Harry\u0027s great-great grandfather.  He wore a beard during his wedding to Princess Mary of Teck in 1893.  Ordinarily it is customary to be clean-shaven when dressed in an Army uniform - which Prince Harry and his best man Prince William both wore. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform. It is understood that the permission covered the fact Harry has a beard. It\u0027s not the only tradition broken by Harry, with the new Duke deciding to wear a wedding band, something his older brother, father and grandfather decided against. Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry, who once toured in Afghanistan, has retired from active service.  Mr Vickers told the Mail: \u0027Theoretically the Army don\u0027t like it which is why at one point he took the Salute at Sandhurst in a suit. Strict British Army rules do not allow bears in normal circumstances with the wearing of them only allowed due to skin complaints or religious reasons. Pioneer Sergeants are the only rank allowed to have a beard, although members of the Special Forces can when behind enemy lines. In December Harry wore a dark suit and overcoat, with medals on the outside, when he represented the Queen and inspected graduating officer cadets at the Sovereign\u0027s Parade at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.

The Duke of Sussex told his wedding guests last night at a reception of his admiration for Meghan\u0027s grace at navigating everything. His speech before close family and friends came after weeks of drama involving the Markles. Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle Senior, had been forced to miss out on the big day as he recovered from a heart attack amid controversy over him staging photos with a paparazzi photographer. Other members of her family had also been feuding over not receiving invites to the wedding, lashing out at Meghan over the snub and targeting her character.  Now it has emerged Prince Harry apparently praised his new wife last night for her handling of the wedding plans. Following a week of drama involving Meghan’s family, Harry is said to have applauded his wife’s cool headedness. He is said to have declared Meghan had “navigated everything with such grace. The Duke added that: “We make such a great team.”  Meghan Markle\u0027s father Thomas had said last week he believed his son Thomas Jnr\u0027s open letter about Meghan may have caused his heart attack. The father of the bride spoke to TMZ about his illness, saying he believes his son\u0027s letter was something that may have led to his second heart attack last week. In April, brother Thomas Markle Junior had told The Mirror in an exclusive interview that famed had changed the US actress. Thomas Jnr had said: “Meg likes to portray herself as a humanitarian, a people’s person and a charitable person but she is none of those things to her family.  “She is giving the greatest \u0026shyperformance of her life. She is acting phoney. Once she got into Hollywood she turned into a different person. She’s clearly forgotten her roots and her family. “Maybe the normal American family she has is embarrassing to her because we’re not producers and executive producers.  He more recently wished Meghan well for the nuptials, admitting he had been an ass and saying she was the best thing to happen to the royal family. Only Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland received an invite to yesterday\u0027s celebrations.

But more than 24 hours after they pledged their love for each other at the stunning St George\u0027s Chapel, everyone is wondering - what is next for the newlyweds? Unlike many other couples, they have chosen to forgo a traditional honeymoon - instead, immediately selflessly dedicating their time to royal duties. Together, they will throw themselves into a hectic schedule and follow through with Meghan’s vow to “hit the ground running” after their nuptials. The Queen, who attended the wedding in a lime green coat, is said to be delighted at how the public has taken the latest royal couple into their hearts.  Meanwhile, courtiers have devised plans to use the new \u0027power couple\u0027 - who revealed their engagement last November - as super-envoys across the world. The Mirror understands Harry, 33, and Meghan, 36, will undertake a Commonwealth tour in October, taking in Australia - where the prince will open his Invictus Games - and New Zealand, as well as the islands of Tonga and Fiji. But touchingly, their first official engagement as husband and wife will be in honour of Harry\u0027s dad Prince Charles\u0027s 70th birthday on Tuesday. Meghan is said to have been overwhelmed with the Prince of Wales’s dedication to making both her and her mother feel at ease during the lead-up to the wedding, and his earnest act of walking her up the aisle yesterday afternoon.  Kensington Palace announced the happy couple will attend the Buckingham Palace garden party to celebrate the heir to the throne\u0027s milestone birthday - which falls in November - by recognising Charles\u0027 patronages and military affiliations as well as others involved in charities supported by the royal. Last night, Meghan and Harry partied with pals in privacy after exchanging vows inside the chapel, watched by a global television audience of millions. They are expected to head home to their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace before attending the birthday patronage celebration for Charles. Today, while the Queen attended church, there was no sign of the newlyweds.   Inside Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0027s love affair with Africa   After the garden party, the newly-styled Duke and Duchess of Sussex will commit to a series of top level meetings with royal advisors to set out their plan for the coming year. The British Government, through the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, also hopes to cement ties with old friends and help smooth the path for trade. The couple - along with Charles and Camilla and William and Kate - will reportedly relish in their role to play a key role in “soft power”diplomacy for the UK. The destination of their official honeymoon is currently unknown.  However, some have predicted they might travel to Botswana, possibly to an exclusive safari camp which the couple visited in August last year. Kensington Palace has always remained tight-lipped regarding the romantic break. But according to Reuters, Harry whisked Meghan away to the luxurious Mapula Lodge near the Okavango Delta to mark her 36th birthday in style. There, the couple reportedly enjoyed a sunset cruise, early morning game drive and twilight dinner, with an onlooker telling the publication: They are like regular guys. They were just relaxed. You could see they were very happy together.  One royal source said countries like Botswana or Namibia - which also offers stunning wildlife and breathtaking scenery - could be top of the honeymoon list. Bookmakers Ladbrokes have seen a flurry of betting for the couple\u0027s honeymoon destination with Namibia emerging as the frontrunner at 2/1. Botswana - a close second at 4/1- is also a place the Duke loves and knows well. He sourced the diamond in his bride\u0027s engagement ring from the country.  Meanwhile, sources have revealed that secret plans have been put in place for Meghan and Harry to have a “mini-moon” celebration in the Republic of Ireland in the coming weeks. The trip could have added significance during a time of heightened tensions following Brexit negotiations and the UK’s relationship with Europe. For Harry, it would be his first visit to the Emerald isle, but Meghan has already visited as an ambassador for the One Young World summit in 2014. The itinerary for their visit in June or July is only in the early stages but it is believed they will just stay for one night.

In 1920, the Reverend David Railton, a First World War army padre, suggested that an unknown soldier from the battlefield should be brought back to Britain for burial as a representative for all who had died. The grave remains a focus for pilgrimage and a powerful symbol, known across the world, of the sacrifice, suffering and bravery brought by war.

Dean David Conner said: “The gift of marriage brings husband and wife together in the delight and tenderness of sexual union and joyful commitment to the end of their lives. “It is given as the foundation of family life in which children are born and nurtured and in which each member of the family, in good times and in bad, may find strength, companionship and comfort, and grow to maturity in love.” As the word “children” was uttered, Harry, 33, turned to Meghan, 36, and smiled.  A Royal source said: “Harry was bursting with pride the whole ceremony but it was that reaction that caught the eye of those who know him best. It was beautiful and subtle nod to the hope they both have that they will become parents as soon as possible.” Royal biographer Andrew Morton, who researched the new Duchess of Sussex’s life while writing a book about her, also said he expected Harry and Meghan to bring a baby into the world soon. Predicting even more happy news for the couple, he said: “I think that even before Meghan has learned how to spell Leicester and Torquay she’ll be starting a family.  “She’s not really going to be available for working for the Royal Family on a full-time basis until she’s 40, I’m sure.” What\u0027s more, William\u0027s brother and Suits actress Meghan have both indicated they\u0027re very keen to start a family during past interviews.

But it was the first one, outside St George\u0027s Chapel, which will become one of the most iconic photographs from the happy day. And the sweet moment is even more special because there\u0027s a touching story behind it.

They then changed into their party gear and drove in a Jaguar E-Type sports car to the evening reception, hosted by Prince Charles.

In the first, 15-year-old Meghan sits on black painted railings outside Buckingham Palace. The grainy photograph shows Meghan in slip-on sandals and sunnies, smiling alongside a pal with her whole life ahead of her. In the second, she is a 36-year-old bride - marrying a prince in front of the whole world. Life is full of surprises, one royal fan wrote on Twitter. One day you\u0027re 15 and posing outside Buckingham Palace and 22 years later you\u0027re marrying the prince. What a love story - a true princess in waiting, another said.  Prince Harry and Meghan got married in a dazzling ceremony that blended ancient English ritual with African-American culture yesterday. The celebration, watched up close by royals and celebrities and from afar by a global TV audience of millions, has made history. The two photographs placed side-by-side serve as a reminder of the vast opportunities that stretch out before you age 15. And a love story is made all the better when it has a happy ending. Harry and Meghan were first introduced in London in July 2016 through mutual friends, but they did not start dating straight away. Meghan was still based in her adopted hometown of Toronto, where her US drama Suits is filmed.    They met while Harry was promoting the Invictus Games - an event he helped launch for disabled military personnel - in London, and Meghan shared a picture of herself visiting Buckingham Palace on July 5. She had also been spotted in the royal box at Wimbledon in late June, prompting speculation she was already well acquainted with Harry\u0027s family. Then, in October 2016, the first rumours surrounding their relationship began swirling when the pair were seen at a halloween-party-ideas-budget-2017-9116382\u0026gtHalloween party in Toronto. It was first thought they pair had been dating for around a month, but Meghan later told Vanity Fair they had managed to keep their romance under wraps for an impressive six months.      We were very quietly dating for about six months before it became news, and I was working during that whole time, and the only thing that changed was people\u0027s perception, she said in October 2017. Nothing about me changed. I\u0027m still the same person that I am, and I\u0027ve never defined myself by my relationship. Once the speculation started bubbling, it did not take long before their relationship was blown into the public sphere. Just two weeks after the news broke, Harry took the unprecedented step of blasting the media for prying into Meghan\u0027s private life - and even called out trolls for making racist comments about her. The statement was the first time Harry called Meghan his girlfriend in public as he warned the media to steer clear.    His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment, the statement read. Some of this has been very public - the smear on the front page of a national newspaper the racial undertones of comment pieces and the outright sexism and racism of social media trolls and web article comments. It went on: Prince Harry is worried about Ms. Markle’s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms. Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is ‘the price she has to pay’ and that ‘this is all part of the game’. He strongly disagrees. This is not a game - it is her life and his. He has asked for this statement to be issued in the hopes that those in the press who have been driving this story can pause and reflect before any further damage is done. He knows that it is unusual to issue a statement like this, but hopes that fair-minded people will understand why he has felt it necessary to speak publicly.  The pair fell love with Africa separately but it was their first trip together as a couple which sealed their romantic fate. Even before the pair met, they were both involved in various charity projects which saw them visiting the sun-soaked continent. Prince Harry often visited as part of his work for the royal\u0027s charity Sentebale and his role as patron for Rhino Conservation Botswana, while Meghan headed to Rwanda when she was a global ambassador for World Vision. However, it is Botswana that already sits at the forefront of their love story. Prince Harry whisked Meghan away for a luxury safari break just four weeks after their first date. Speaking to the BBC in their engagement interview, Harry said: I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic.  Meghan did a glossy covershoot and interview with Vanity Fair in October 2017, in which she repeatedly called the royal her boyfriend and gushed about their relationship. We\u0027re a couple. We\u0027re in love, she said. I\u0027m sure there will be a time when we will have to come forward and present ourselves and have stories to tell, but I hope what people will understand is that this is our time. This is for us. It\u0027s part of what makes it so special, that it\u0027s just ours. But we\u0027re happy. Personally, I love a great love story. I can tell you that at the end of the day I think it\u0027s really simple. We\u0027re two people who are really happy and in love. Just seven months after they met, Harry reportedly took Meghan to London to meet his brother Prince William and sister-in-law Kate Middleton - the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  He is also thought to have introduced his girlfriend to the Queen on Mother\u0027s Day, Sunday March 26 2017. She came with him to Kate\u0027s sister Pippa Middleton\u0027s wedding in May, carefully avoiding the cameras by getting Harry to pick her up after the church ceremony and just in time for the evening reception. The two were seen together at the Invictus Games in Toronto on September 25 2017. Dressed down in skinny ripped jeans, a white shirt and sunglasses, Meghan laughed and smiled as Harry whispered in her ear in full view of spectators. They cosied up together with lots of affectionate touches - and were even spotted kissing inside their private box where Meghan\u0027s mum Doria and her best friends Markus Anderson and Jessica Mulroney were given seats. Kensington Palace announced the couple were engaged on November 27 2017 following weeks of speculation. Later that day, they did an interview with BBC presenter Mishal Husain and revealed extra romantic details about the engagemet.  Meghan admitted it was sweet, natural and very romantic and just a standard typical night in for the pair. The actress admitted she barely let her husband-to-be finish proposing before she said: Can I say yes now? One of their first appearances was at Reprezent 107.3FM in Brixton, south London, in January. The pair later made a trip to Cardiff where Meghan was asked by sisters Anne and Judy Daley - who brought a veil, plastic tiara and bridal sash gift for Meghan - to ask if she would hold her hen party in Cardiff. The beaming actress told them: I bet that would be a lot of fun, before being led away by Prince Harry. In reality the star had a rather quieter hen do in the Cotswolds. Days before the wedding, the pair\u0027s plans were thrown into chaos after Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, pulled out of the ceremony.

Mary Kinninmonth, director of Dundee’s Citizens Advice Bureau, said UC’s online system hampers less computer-literate claimants.She said: “The main things we see are people still having difficulty in making and managing online claims due to lack of confidence and/or knowledge of computer skills.“The helpline is also very difficult to get through to with long waiting times.“Even though the waiting time has reduced, there is still a waiting time – which will often mean people going into rent arrears.”Full service UC rolled out in Dundee in November, following a trial period for new single applicants.The number of Universal Credit issues dealt with by Dundee CAB has risen by almost 50% following the introduction of the full service.Dundee City Council gives UC claimants a reprieve over their arrears, acknowledging the delayed payouts the DWP makes from month to month.A spokesman for the authority said a £250,000 hardship fund for council tenants was created in April 2016, boosted to £450,000 for this year.He added: “We continue to do a considerable amount work to support tenants on Universal Credit.“If a tenant is having difficulties paying their rent a referral to the Council Advice Service is made. Staff there can offer help and assistance.”A spokeswoman for the DWP said claimants can receive advance payments if required from day one.She added: “We have removed the seven-day waiting period from new claims and pay people’s Housing Benefit for two weeks while they wait for their first full Universal Credit payment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/PA-28105789-843x564.jpg ","title":"dundee announce signing of french midfielder","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee have announced the signing of a French midfielder.Elton Ngwatala has penned a deal at Dens Park and is Neil McCann\u0026#8217s first signing of the summer.The Dark Blues have snapped up the 24-year-old attacking player on a two-year deal despite interest from down south.Ngwatala previously played for Kidderminster Harriers in two spells at the National League North side.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0094a37a7-e1526475640876-928x564.jpg ","title":"dundee boss neil mccann admits hes made mistakes but looks to learn from them","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee boss Neil McCann says he had higher targets for his team this past season but insists an early start can get the Dark Blues where he wants them to be this time next year.A ninth-placed finish in the Premiership fell short of his stated top-half aim but Neil insists he learned a lot from his debut campaign as a manager.He said: “I think you have to self-analyse.“I’ve made mistakes, as a young manager I think that’s normal but, hopefully, if you’re learning from those it will put you in a better position next season.“In terms of going into the last five games, I learned a lot from my squad.“There was huge pressure going into the Hamilton game.“We knew it could have been a total role reversal and our goal difference was poorer so we knew the risk we were playing under but the players were brave and in it together.“That’ll help me 100% next season.

In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing.

The police are never out of there,” she said.“Why are they creating a new community campus and putting this right smack bang in the middle?‘‘It’s disgraceful.”Tom Henney, who drew up a petition against the custody unit, said he wasn’t opposed to the SPS proposals.‘‘My opinion is still the same – nobody has any objection to what they’re trying to do but there are other areas better suited for this,” he said.“My biggest concern is if (offenders) get out.‘‘There are drugs, there is crime and it shouldn’t be here.”However, Ann Hutchison, 57, who lives two minutes from Our Lady’s, said she was “keeping an open mind” on the plans.She added: “I’m glad the prison service are out speaking to the community. They should be.”Councillors were also in attendance at the information session, but couldn’t comment directly on the proposals as they are yet to come through the planning system.The SPS’s Tom Fox said it was inevitable that locals were concerned, but added: “Most of these are based on ideas of something that this unit isn’t.‘‘It is not a prison.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9ae43941b-846x564.jpg ","title":"thousands across dundee celebrate ramadan and locals invited to join evening meal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of Muslims in Dundee have started celebrating the holy month of Ramadan – and locals are being invited to take part to find out more about the festival.Ramadan takes place in the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and commemorates the first revelation of the Koran to Muhammad.Bashir Chohan, head of Dundee Islamic Society, said that as of Thursday, Muslims from 13 nationalities across the city were observing the event.Mr Chohan said: “It is an important event in the Muslim calendar and involves a period of fasting for the next 30 days.“We fast from dawn until dusk when we are allowed to begin eating again.“I have my first meal of the day at 9.30pm when we usually begin eating with a selection of snacks.“We eat all sorts of food at this time from east and west and often begin with a cold drink or a milkshake.”Mr Chohan explained that fasting was for adults with children beginning to take part from the age of about 10-12.He said: “It is up to children and their families to decide when the children can cope with fasting.”Mr Choham said that at night, following the breaking of the fast, Muslims would be going along to the five mosques in the city to pray.“We listen to the Imam reciting from the Koran for an hour and we say special prayers,” he said.“And while at the mosque we serve around 300 to 400 meals a night to visitors.”During Ramadam, Mr Chohan said that Muslims were also expected to be on their best behaviour at all times.“Of course we should always be on our best behaviour but it is particularly important during Ramadan,” he said.“Ramadan is a very spiritual time for us. It is a peaceful time and an opportunity to repair body and soul.“We eat for the rest of the year and it is an order from God to obey his rules and take part in fasting and prayer during Ramadan.”Mr Chohan said that, as always, he would welcome Dundee residents to visit the mosques during Ramadan.He said: “Anyone is welcome to visit our mosques and take part in what is happening during the month.“We would be delighted for people to come along and see what we do and take part if they so wish.“Women as well as men are very welcome to attend. We are happy to share our religious beliefs and traditions with everyone in Dundee.”Ramadan began this year on May 15 and will end on Thursday June 14.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Times Past  Looking back at life Doon the Watter","story":"                          Evocative Images from the Archives of the Herald and Evening Times."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7702341.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Everything drivers need to know about today s Race for Life road closures","story":"                          GLASGOW will be transformed into a sea of pink today\u0026nbspas the annual Race for Life event gets underway."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7810183.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Public consultation to open next week on   9m plans for Byres Road","story":"                          A PUBLIC consultation on design proposals for the future of Byres Road will begin next week.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern. That may go on to be a great success in another city but it wasn\u0026rsquot for Inverness or the location.\"A two-day public consultation was held last December at the city\u0027 railway station and in the Eastgate Shopping Centre to gather opinions about the overall riverside arts project to consider \"how the river should connect with the people and community of Inverness\".The arts initiative has been plagued by complaints about design and costs.The council has consistently stressed that the overall \u0026pound759,000 project, featuring a range of different art installations, is publicly funded but largely through ring-fenced grants.They were \u0026ndash Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,600), the Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound281,000), the council\u0027 \"cities gateway\" initiative (\u0026pound66,000), Highlands and Islands Enterprise (\u0026pound66,000) and a further \u0026pound40,000 from the council. Backers also emphasised that if Inverness spurned the project the funding would simply go elsewhere in Scotland.The local authority\u0027 Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"It is in development and about to be revealed to the public.\"I\u0026rsquom confident the new proposal will prove a big hit for the city.
