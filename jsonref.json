The singer was having lunch at his Algarve retreat in August 2014 when the police raided his luxury apartmentThe ramifications of that dramatic raid on August 14, 2014, are still being felt today. But the sorry saga started two months earlier when BBC reporter Dan Johnson received a tip-off from a confidential source.It was at the height of Operation Yewtree, the extraordinary Metropolitan Police investigation into a string of celebrities following the Jimmy Savile scandal.A junior but ambitious reporter, Mr Johnson said his tipster had revealed there was ‘one more high profile person being investigated’. The reference was oblique, but the journalist guessed correctly it was Sir Cliff. And when the source told Mr Johnson, whose BBC patch is the north of England, that the investigation was ‘closer to home’, he also worked out it involved South Yorkshire Police.Although Mr Johnson never named his source, the court ruled yesterday it was most probably either a police officer from the Yewtree inquiry or someone associated with the police.The reporter was on the trail of what his boss called a ‘bloody cracking’ scoop – but he was described by the judge as ‘capable of letting his enthusiasm for his story get the better of his complete regard for truth’.‘BLACKMAILING’ THE POLICEOn July 9, armed with his sensational tip, Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to South Yorkshire Police’s head of communications, Carrie Goodwin. When he casually asked whether Sir Cliff was ‘on their radar’, she gave ‘an audible gasp’, he told the court.          Police officers search the property of pop star Sir Cliff Richards in Sunningdale, Berkshire in August 2014. Sir Cliff watched the breaking news Miss Goodwin, who had been privately briefed about the highly sensitive investigation by police chiefs, remarked that he had good sources, claimed Mr Johnson.Miss Goodwin told Matthew Fenwick, the detective superintendent leading the investigation, and chief constable David Crompton. The police say they decided to co-operate with the BBC to avoid the story being broadcast and tipping off their suspect before they were ready to swoop on his home.They invited Mr Johnson in for a meeting. At 1pm on July 15, he met Miss Goodwin and Mr Fenwick – and their discussion is hotly contested.The reporter claimed police voluntarily gave him information about their investigation, confirming it involved a 13-year-old boy allegedly sexually assaulted in a dressing room after a Billy Graham event in Sheffield in the 1980s.But the force said Mr Johnson already knew these details and used them to ‘blackmail’ police into giving the BBC advance notice of their raid on Sir Cliff’s apartment.Either way, a deal was struck. Miss Goodwin said the police would give Mr Johnson the date and location of the search if he agreed not to broadcast the information in advance.EXCITEMENT AT THE BBCJubilant that his ‘tactics’ had worked, Mr Johnson told his BBC editor Declan Wilson, who passed it on to his own boss, Gary Smith, with an email entitled: ‘Sit down when you read this.’In reply, Mr Smith quoted from Sir Cliff’s 1968 Eurovision Song Contest entry by saying: ‘Congratulations. And jubilations. I want the world to know I’m happy as can be.’ Mr Wilson claimed police had even considered arresting tennis fan Sir Cliff at Wimbledon, adding: ‘Off record, they want the publicity as they believe there are others.’          A very emotional looking Sir Cliff Richard seen leaving the High Court after winning his battle with the BBC. The judge said: ‘Excitement was being created in the BBC over the prospect of the story.’ When Mr Johnson was asked by his boss how he had managed to persuade the police, he said he had got detectives ‘over a barrel because of the tip-off I had received’.On the evening of August 13, police stuck to their deal and gave the journalist the details he needed. They even emailed him an aerial photo of the apartment block.The BBC machine swung into action. Camera teams were dispatched to the apartment in Berkshire, police HQ in Sheffield, Sir Cliff’s home in the Algarve and his other home in Barbados. And that helicopter was fired up.Mr Smith, the BBC’s UK news editor, wrote in a gleeful email: ‘The money shots will be police going in and out of his flat and loading bags of hard drives or whatever into their vans. We can only get this from the helicopter.’BBC BEAT POLICE TO THE DOOROn the morning of August 14, Operation Kaddie was launched – and hapless police found the BBC were already there.Mr Johnson and two other reporters and their crews had set up camera angles well before 9am, ready to cover the drama live. As the helicopter hovered overhead, a police press officer updated Mr Johnson with text messages.Woman \u0027saw a black Mercedes like the one owned by Borce...Share this articleIn five cars, eight police officers entered the gated estate at 9.35am. They spoke to a building manager who phoned Sir Cliff in Portugal to tell him police had arrived with a warrant to search his home. Sir Cliff later told how, as a decent, law-abiding citizen, all he thought was that he must help the police and instructed the manager to ‘Please let them in’.Police entered the apartment at 10.40am, and three minutes later Mr Johnson was informed by text.From the camera in the helicopter, officers were filmed going through the singer’s possessions. And on the ground, an officer read a prepared statement to a BBC crew. By now, Sir Cliff’s lawyers had been alerted too and were racing to the scene.A ‘HUDDLE’ IN THE NEWSROOMIn the BBC newsroom at 12.15pm, managers held a ‘huddle’ to discuss their scoop and whether to name Sir Cliff, even though police had not. The go-ahead was given by deputy director of news Fran Unsworth, who considered it ‘strongly’ in the public interest.At 1pm the BBC unveiled its ‘top story this lunchtime’ along with dramatic footage of the police raid.          News helicopter images of police arriving to search the Berkshire property belonging to Sir Cliff Richard in relation to an alleged historical sex offence. The ‘vile’ allegations hung over him for almost two years until the police dropped the case without any charges The broadcast went live to Mr Johnson outside the property, and he continued his breathless reports on the BBC News Channel all afternoon. In total there were 44 BBC TV broadcasts that afternoon, with Sir Cliff’s strenuous denials added to the reports from 2pm.A BBC editor, Richard Clark, sent Mr Johnson a congratulatory email saying: ‘Good work, Dan. Well done.’ The reporter replied it was ‘old-fashioned journalism’.But by the evening, an explosive row was brewing.THE FALLOUTOn Radio 4’s Six O’Clock News, respected home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw suggested the BBC’s tip-off had been an ‘attempt by the police to ensure maximum coverage’ of the raid.South Yorkshire Police responded angrily, saying they had not tipped off Mr Johnson, who had ‘blackmailed’ them. Press chief Miss Goodwin complained to him: ‘This wasn’t the case and brings the force into disrepute.’She wrote to her chief constable: ‘It’s wildly inaccurate. The Met leaked it and we asked the BBC not to run it.’ As police prepared an explosive press release claiming the BBC had been fed the tip by Operation Yewtree, Mr Johnson, knowing his tip-off had come from someone outside South Yorkshire Police, begged his superiors to put out a correction to the Danny Shaw report.

We had a cold winter which has helped to kill pests, and some plants perform better following a cold dormant season.

He became withdrawn and irritable, started to complain about the job he had always loved and, she suspected, was teetering on the verge of a breakdown.Ironically, she was going through the menopause at the time and wasn’t too bothered about her waning sex life — until she recognised the damaging effect it was having on their overall relationship.Viagra made a big difference — and not just to their sex life. Her husband’s mood perked up, too.Was it the worst thing that had happened to her in 20 years of marriage? No, it was the best. She got her husband back. The sex was just a bonus, which, eventually, she welcomed back into her life.For male impotence — or erectile dysfunction to give it its proper name — has long stopped being something we snigger at. It’s a condition that affects as many as one in five men. For up to 4.3 million in the UK alone, the little blue pill known as Viagra has been hailed as a magic bullet.After becoming available over-the-counter earlier this year — in supermarkets with pharmacies as well as without a prescription at chemists — it seems as if the stigma of artificially boosting a flagging sex life with medication has finally been laid to rest.No more embarrassing chats with the GP required, asking for Viagra if you are a middle-aged or older man has become as normalised as a request for paracetamol or indigestion remedies.          Viagra has been hailed as a magic bullet for men who suffer from erectile dysfunction At the last count, the Royal College of General Practitioners there were three million prescriptions for Viagra in 2016, up from one million ten years earlier, which they attributed to ‘to a sharp rise in growing awareness of erectile dysfunction and its treatment, and an ageing population who expect a good sex life’.Yet, according to Diane von Furstenberg, the impossibly glamorous 71-year-old American designer and inventor of the iconic wrap dress, this has been a nightmare for wives and partners. She articulated it thus: ‘There was a certain amount of fairness. A woman couldn’t have a child after 40 ... but the man could have a child until 65, but sexually, after a while …’ Meaning, he finally lost his sexual prowess, making things even again.Reading between the lines, it seems that the woman who, back in the 1970s, ‘wanted women to feel slinky, sexy and feline’, feels that now she’s hit her own 70s, she — and every other woman besides — would rather be left alone in the sexual department, and would be mercifully allowed to sleep in peace were it not for the dreaded Viagra.Trump targets Pfizer and big Pharma for raising costs of...Raising more than suspicion! Police seize fake VIAGRA and...Share this articleThe implication is that while women have nothing like Viagra to help them out, and have perhaps run out of sexual steam, their partners are unfairly demanding they revive their love life because Viagra has restored their mojo.Poor older women, all having to lie back and think of England, when they’d rather be tucking into a good novel before lights out.First of all, I’d like to point out, older women do have something to help them out in the libido department. It’s called HRT and, in many instances, it boosts their hormones and their sense of well being.Secondly, the idea that only men are interested in keeping things going in bed as they age, while women would rather curl up with their Kindle, is a myth. And it’s surprising that the liberated von Furstenberg, a mega-successful businesswoman, worth more than £200million, who has been married to a prince and now a film mogul and once had an affair with Ryan O’Neill, subscribes to it.          Debate over the drug was sparked after Diane von Furstenberg branded it the worst thing to happen to women in the last 15 yearsA recent study suggested that more than half of over-65s, both male and female, would like more sex than they’re getting, which hardly tallies with the notion that Viagra is a disaster for women.Saying that, Von Furstenberg does have a point — mismatched libidos have been the downfall of many relationships and not all post-menopausal women relish the idea of sex. But giving up on sex altogether as you age can also kill a marriage.Admittedly, there is another, unfortunate side-effect of Viagra for women — the number of cases in which some men’s new found sexual confidence has resulted in them wanting to demonstrate their sexual prowess outside, as well as within, their primary relationship.Given the huge rise in orce and the number of men and women embarking on new relationships in their 50s and beyond, it’s not unreasonable to assume that with one in five affected by erectile dysfunction a large number of relationships would fall at the first hurdle, so to speak, without the help of Viagra.Anything that can help keep couples together cannot be deemed a disaster, can it?Something that people seem to forget is that desire is a pre-requisite for Viagra working. Viagra doesn’t create desire, it facilitates it.Countless older couples still want to express their love for one another through sexual intimacy. I don’t understand why anyone would demonise Viagra for making that possible.YES - says Liz Hodgkinson, who argues it can\u0027t put the magic back into a marriage that\u0027s lost its sexual spark           Writer Liv Hodgkinson, 74, said Viagra is a disaster for older womenWhen my late mother-in-law was about 70, she asked me — her worldly daughter-in-law — a very intimate question: ‘How old are they when they don’t want to do that sort of thing any more?’At one time, one might have replied that at 70, very few men remained interested in that sort of thing — and in any case, their ability had probably completely disappeared long ago.Those days are now over. Thanks to the invention of Viagra, older men now believe that all they have to do to maintain their sex lives into extreme old age is to take a couple of little blue pills.Viagra is widely available, dirt cheap and no longer available only on prescription. It is one of the most successful drugs ever marketed and thousands, maybe millions, of men have blessed it for restoring their waning libido.But hang on a minute. What about their partners or spouses?Fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg has come out and said what many older women, myself included, have suspected for some time: that although Viagra may have been a wonderful invention for older men, it has been little short of a disaster for women of the same age.It means that however old we are, we are never allowed to let our sex lives die a natural and — it has to be said — often much longed-for death.Instead, we are expected to maintain our desire for sex and also for someone who, in reality, we may not have fancied sexually for decades. Hormonal changes thanks to the menopause may make sex uncomfortable, too.Many of my friends who have been in long marriages say that they are happy enough to continue in their relationship but relieved that sex no longer plays a part. Instead, they have become companions and friends, living together in a relaxed, low-key way.They tell me they would be horrified if their husbands suddenly came home with a gleam in their eye and waving a packet of Viagra. Why, they say, would they want to go to all the trouble of having sex with him again? Why, when they have been perfectly happy without it for many years. At 70-plus, many of us now remember energetic, frenetic sex with winsome nostalgia. Something that was lovely but belonged to a certain time — and a certain body — long gone, and we are happy to hand the baton over to the younger generation.And yet, thanks to the hype surrounding Viagra, the new conventional wisdom has it that a woman thinking along those lines is something of a party pooper. Indeed, I’d say there is an element of competition about it, with some women competing to appear the most lascivious.Viagra works by restoring blood supply to the penis and thus enabling an erection, even for men who may not have been able to maintain one for years. And that, basically, is all it can do.Yet over the years, Viagra has been infused with a kind of mystique and credited with the ability to bring back the magic into a relationship that may have long since lost all its excitement.Yet the truth is that it cannot turn you back on to someone who no longer interests you in that way. It cannot bring back love, closeness, affection and tenderness into a marriage that has long lost its spark. It may make a man randy but has no equal power to deliver female arousal or desire.My own view is that if a couple are turning to Viagra to give their relationship a lift, other than for medical reasons, then it probably is in trouble anyway.The pill’s effects are temporary, not guaranteed and can cause much anxiety and unwelcome pressure in a relationship.In any case, Viagra does not always have the desired erectile effect, as I know from experience. My late partner John had some trouble in that department when he was placed on beta-blockers after developing a heart condition.Beta-blockers act by sending blood to the heart and away from the extremities. As John was only in his early 60s at the time, and in a new relationship — with me – he thought he might give Viagra, newly on the market, a go.His lack of a sex life was making him very upset. There had already been much excited talk about this new wonder drug and he asked his doctor about it.The doctor said my partner had to be careful as he had high blood pressure and a heart condition, but felt that a mild dose might do the trick without causing problems.So he tried it — but it just didn’t work. We waited and waited for it to take effect, but no. Nothing happened. And he was reluctant to try the drug again because of his heart problem.I have to say that his apparent dysfunction made absolutely no difference to the quality of our relationship. We had a lot of fun and laughter together, went on wonderful holidays and, all in all, had a marvellously fulfilling time until he died 14 years ago.I know that it is possible to have a satisfying — even erotic — relationship with someone without conventional sex, and towards the end of his life, my partner said: ‘You’ve made an old man very happy.’Perhaps novelist Kingsley Amis had the right idea when he said, at the age of 70, that he had spent 50 years chained to an idiot (his libido) and now at last he was free. Now Viagra can keep men chained to that idiot for the whole of their lives, is that really such a good thing?"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/12/4E6E498000000578-5972791-image-a-34_1532085206224.jpg","title":"Flights Gatwick diverted plane performs emergency landing London airport","story":"This is the pilot who landed the BA flight that got into trouble after a hydraulic fluid leak last night, in an incident that left passengers in tears           Passengers clapped and cheered him as he thanked them for their patience and staying calm  Israeli model Gofit Goln was on board the flight (pictured) and captured the moment they landed and when the pilot spokeBA cancels MORE flights at Heathrow as an IT breakdown adds...Earthquakes strike again between Dorking and Gatwick airport...Share this articleHundreds of passengers were left stranded at the wrong airport this morning  after eight flights into Gatwick were erted when a plane performed an emergency landing due to a hydraulic fluid leak.Four flights were sent to Birmingham, two to Stansted and two to Luton after the The British Airways flight from Naples  was forced to perform the emergency manoeuvre.The aircraft, which was carrying multiple groups of school pupils, required towing from the runway and the landing resulted in a spill of hydraulic fluid.The plane made a rapid descent into Gatwick Airport, according to data collected by Flight Radar.The runway was closed and a standby runway was opened. Gatwick officials were hopeful of reopening the main runway by 4.30am.   The footage was posted by Israeli model Hofit Golan who also filmed herself exiting the jet and passing the four fire engines waiting on the runway          A British Airways flight from Naples made an emergency landing at Gatwick tonight after experiencing a hydraulic fluid leak in mid-air  Fire crews are seen rushing to inspect Flight BA2605, forcing the closure of the runway          While the runway was temporary closed, a standby runway was open.

Among the items on display is a family photo of Charles holding his first grandchild, Prince George, with the Duke of Cambridge beside him. (To the right is an 18th century Japanese-style bureau cabinet)          One of the works which reflects the Prince\u0027s cultural side is this 18th century masterpiece The Tribuna of the Uffizi by Johan Joseph Zoffany. Considered the German artist\u0027s greatest painting, it depicts a group of aristocrats set against a backdrop of masterpieces. It was commissioned by Queen Charlotte in 1772, but she actually disliked the finished product. Zoffany was criticised for including too many figures, and according to one historical diary, the Queen \u0027would not suffer the picture to be placed in any of her apartments\u0027. Charles, however, is a fan of the intricate painting          Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction - entitled Prince and Patron - which marks his 70th birthday year. Among the items above, a painting of Charles II is adjusted by a member of the Royal Collection Trust staff. On display are works from such masters as Holbein, Raphael, Rubens and Titian  In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry (above, right) by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers. The piece in the centre is a sketch of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, circa 1841  One of the highlights of the exhibition is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak (left) - a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. The cloak was taken from Bonaparte\u0027s baggage train immediately after the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and given to the future George IV by the Field Marshal who fought alongside the Duke of Wellington.

The larvae then hatched in her body, grew and became trapped in the eye.\u0027(The worm) could have moved along the intestines and travelled across her body. It could even have gone into her brain,\u0027 said Dr Gong.Ms Yang was given a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan in the brain after the operation to ensure no larvae or worm was there.  She is waiting to hear the results of the scan.Dr Gong said she could go home within a week if all check results are fine.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/20/11/4E6B41EE00000578-5972009-image-a-57_1532081442849.jpg","title":"Last indigenous man Amazon tribe seen camera Rondonia Brazil","story":"    Captivating footage has emerged of the last known survivor of an Amazonian tribe who has wandered the rainforest alone for 22 years - after the rest of his people were wiped out by murderous land-grabbing cattle ranchers two decades ago.

Those with perfect attendance are being rewarded! Nothing wrong with that.\u0027Like saying everyone is a winner...rubbish. First place is a winner. That\u0027s life.\u0027Paige Banks said: \u0027I don\u0027t see how this isn\u0027t a good thing. Those attendancelateness statistics are shocking. Only 29 pupils out of 420 managed 100 per cent attendance?\u0027Why shouldn\u0027t those who went to school on time every day be treated?\u0027Head teacher Linda Wilmann said it was the school council who decided what rewards youngsters who get 100 per cent attendance should get.She added: \u0027Attendance and punctuality are crucial in ensuring children get the most from their time at school and at Maypole Primary School we have always rewarded pupils for good attendance.\u0027Earlier this year, through our School Council, we asked every child in the school to vote on how they felt they and their peers should be rewarded for achieving 100 per cent attendance.\u0027They voted unanimously in favour of the rewards that are now in place.\u0027Every two weeks, pupils who have not had any days off during that period are rewarded with what we call \u0027golden time\u0027 - a 30-minute period spent with the school dog Max.\u0027If a child is off school ill during one period they will have another opportunity to receive an award after the following fortnight.\u0027Those pupils who do not miss a single day of school from September to July will be able to take part in a fun day in the summer.\u0027We have always had an annual award for those pupils who achieve 100 per cent attendance for the whole year.\u0027This is a massive achievement, which should be recognised.\u0027Just 29 pupils out of 420 will receive the reward this year so it is not the case that only a few children are missing out.\u0027We would like to congratulate those pupils who have achieved 100 per cent attendance and we hope they enjoy the activities we have planned for them.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37c0a58456e3f92e1ab67b0ef50dac1b94cff3ad/1208_460_3574_2144/master/3574.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59d025bda4e7630f83d1139a304bb7c9","title":"streets in the sky the sheffield high rises that were home sweet home love among ruins","story":"Rollerskating paper girls, daredevil sunbathers, high altitude milkmen … a new photography show beautifully captures the first and last days of a Sheffield estate and its residentsBill Stephenson had been trying to photograph the residents of one of Sheffield’s most notorious housing estates for some time when he realised he was going about things all wrong. No one trusted him, this outsider with a southern accent and a fancy camera, parachuting in from the city’s leafy Nether Edge area. They didn’t appreciate him hanging around Hyde Park, snatching photographs of them as they went about their lives amid the brutalist concrete they called home, perched on the hill above Sheffield railway station.He started to leave his posh Billingham bag at home. His Hasselblad, worth thousands, went in a carrier bag with a towel at the bottom to protect it. Sometimes he never even took it out. “Often I’d go up there and not take any pictures,” he says. “I’d just sit on a bench and smoke and chat to people, go for coffee at the drop-in centre. There’s always someone on an estate who knows everyone, so I found that person and got them to introduce me to everyone else.”It was 1988 and Hyde Park was set for demolition. Barely 20 years after its construction, residents were about to be scattered across Sheffield’s seven hills. It was a sad ending for what had been – along with its sister development, Park Hill – the ultimate symbol of Sheffield council’s pioneering postwar vision for social housing.It would have been easy, says Stephenson, to have just done “alienation” photography: “You just get someone standing in this brutal concrete environment with the building towering over them and the wind whistling around them.” The flats have often been depicted as a brutalist nightmare: director Shane Meadows used Park Hill as the home of his This Is England ’90 characters when they started smoking heroin.But Stephenson didn’t want to go down that road. The people he met, wandering around with his carrier bag and its precious cargo, loved living in Hyde Park. Yes, times were tough, with many residents unemployed after the closure of the pits and the steelworks. But they were proud of their community and didn’t want to move. He set about photographing them at home, sunbathing on the balconies, playing snooker at the youth club and canoodling in the doorways. There are bubble perms and stonewashed denim, knee socks and white stilettos, Saturday night gladrags and grubby playclothes. One particularly pleasing image shows Sue, a community linchpin and owner of the estate’s shop, stacking Nice’n’Easy hairdye in her overalls. Her slightly raised eyebrows seem a warning to anyone who asked for credit – known locally as “strap”, as in “strapped for cash” – and didn’t pay it back. She’d name and shame them, Stephenson recalls, using cards placed in her shop window. Another afternoon he caught two girls, Anita and Emma, looking fed-up as they delivered newspapers in their rollerboots and grey school skirts.It wasn’t strict documentary photography. Most of the images are posed. Stephenson calls them “semi-formal”. He didn’t manipulate his subjects or get them to do anything they weren’t already doing, but he had their permission to shoot and they had a veto on their photos being made public.His favourite image was of a strapping young black lad known locally as Tony the Ton, who was mucking about with his eight-year-old nephew, Martin. Both are topless: Tony in red tracksuit bottoms and Martin in little grey shorts, his knees knocked together as he mirrored his uncle’s crossed arms. “I was just there talking to them and captured the moment,” says Stephenson. “They didn’t feel threatened by me.”Many of the pictures show what had become a very mixed community. One captures a teenage couple, Faisal and Paula, their arms entwined outside the service lift. He is wearing Joe Bloggs jeans with transfers on them, she is in baggy denim and an argyle sweater. He looks Asian, she is white – and seems shyly delighted to have bagged a boyfriend.Stephenson admits to seeking out these relationships. “At the time,” he says, “there had been a series of race riots across the UK and the press liked to talk a lot about racial tension, which I didn’t think told the whole story at all. What I saw at Hyde Park was a community that integrated beautifully.”The resulting pictures featured in a show at Sheffield’s Untitled gallery in 1988 and then toured nationally. Thirty years on, Stephenson’s pictures are about to go on display again, this time only a few minutes away from where they were taken. S1 Artspace, a gallery and collection of artists’ studios, has relocated from the city centre to the old residents’ garage behind Park Hill, which was listed by English Heritage in 1998 and is midway through a massive regeneration project by developers Urban Splash.S1 Artspace reopens in its new home today with Love Among the Ruins, a show that juxtaposes Stephenson’s pictures of Hyde Park with shots taken by another social documentary photographer, Roger Mayne, between 1961 and 1965. Mayne had been commissioned to show the early days of Park Hill, when it was the place everyone wanted to live – and before the Corbusier-inspired walkways designed for milkfloats had become a convenient escape route for ne’er-do-wells doing drug runs on their bikes.His images show the utopian vision of the architects, Jack Lynn and Ivor Smith, who had been tasked with solving the city’s housing and health crises by creating high-rise communities that would enjoy the same amenities as traditional neighbourhoods. The striking difference between Mayne and Stephenson’s images is the gender mix. In the 1960s, Park Hill appeared almost entirely populated by women. Bundled up in overcoats, curlers visible under head scarves, they went to the bingo and bossed the kids around while the men were out at work.By the time Stephenson arrived, the men were unemployed and the council considered Hyde Park flats a failed experiment in social housing. Shortly after he took his final frame, the bulldozers were sent in. He has kept in touch with many residents. One, Donna Hargreaves, got in touch recently after seeing a photograph of herself that was used to advertise the S1 show in the Sheffield Star. He captured her as a 14-year-old, straddling the fourth floor concrete balcony in white shorts and a red and white striped T-shirt with her friend Carmen. Now in her mid-40s, she planned to attend this week’s opening.Others did not make it into middle age. One boy took his own life a girl died after a life of health problems. For some, being photographed was a confidence boost. Leroy, whom Stephenson photographed on the Hyde Park swings as a 14-year-old, contacted him recently. “He said, ‘I was amazed you wanted to photograph me. People like me were invisible then: black teenagers living on a housing estate like Hyde Park.’ He’s doing really well now and has a great job as an IT guy.”Life changed for Stephenson too. He started a family and, unable to make ends meet doing social documentary photography, began taking commercial work: weddings on Saturdays, TV work and PR gigs that never made his heart sing. But he will forever be proud of the eight months he spent traipsing around Hyde Park with his camera in a carrier bag."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d45785e2a246fa7751b8f4bde23cc8d4bb44fd0/0_0_5939_3563/master/5939.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=735fa5988cdce4a86da798300b881902","title":"brexicon an a z lexicon of brexit","story":"Hard or soft, clean, dirty or frictionless? As the EU debate reaches boiling point, it’s time to take a closer look at its unique lexiconThe syndrome known as “Brexit anxiety” is now so common that a team of psychotherapists from the Existential Academy is offering free sessions to help people avoid “being sucked into a vortex of gloom and doom”. Unfortunately only continental Europeans living in the UK qualify, so the rest of us will just have to pretend we like living in a vortex.It was clever of pro-Brexit people to call themselves “Brexiteers”, borrowing the swashbuckling, adventuresome associations of “buccaneeer”. By contrast, “Remainers” were boring old stick-in-the-muds, and were subsequently relabelled “Remoaners” by those who had spent literally decades moaning about the EU.Brexit, intones the prime minister without fail, will enable us to “take back control over our money, laws, and borders”. That will be a relief after so many years in which the pound was controlled by Germany, all our laws were written by drunken Belgians, and we employed absolutely no one in the section of the Home Office called Border Force. See also: sovereignty.Michael Gove is sad that his opinion on experts is often quoted out of context so as to make him appear an anti-rational imbecile. What he said was that “people in this country have had enough of experts from organisations with acronyms saying that they know what is best and getting it consistently wrong”. He was responding to the observation that the IFS, CBI, NHS and TUC had all said that Brexit would be bad, but none of these names are acronyms, because they are not pronounced as words they are instead initialisms. As you were, then: imbecile it is.Initially we desired to continue having “frictionless” trade with the EU, until this aspiration was clarified (ie, reversed) to become “as frictionless as possible”, which means not frictionless, until May said once again that it would be “frictionless”, using magical technology that doesn’t exist yet in order to remove the need for physical border checks. It is in fact notoriously hard to escape friction, and only really possible in space, which is probably where we will end up drawing the Irish border.In his first newspaper column since his resignation, Johnson waxed poetastical once more on his vision of a post-Brexit “Global Britain”, rather than the old Britain that never traded with any countries other than those in the EU, and that almost nobody could find on a globe. Soon, he enthused, we can “go back out in the world in a way we had perhaps forgotten”, which certainly goes some way to explaining his performance as foreign secretary.As the Pet Shop Boys presciently asked: which do you choose, the hard or soft option? The metaphor of a “hard Brexit” appealed to soft-fleshed types who dream of being manly and thrusting, while a “soft Brexit” still sounds altogether too submissive. Having newly discovered a concern for hygiene, Tory rebels now say they want a “clean Brexit”, not the filthy, presumably French kind.June 23, the date of the 2016 referendum, is now celebrated as “Independence Day” by the hardest of Brexiters. This is odd since, in the film Independence Day, London, New York City, Paris and Berlin are all destroyed by aliens. To add insult to injury, during the second invasion in Independence Day: Resurgence, the rebuilt London is destroyed again. It’s almost as if it’s a metaphor for the prospective harm to the public purse after the City loses its passporting rights for financial services across the EU.A jobs-first Brexit, as officially promised by the Labour party, is rather like a cake-first diet, or guns‑first pacifism. On the night of the referendum, hedge funds laid huge bets that sterling would crash, on the basis of private exit polling that indicated a leave result. They made hundreds of millions of dollars, so at least someone enjoyed a Brexit idend (qv).Liberty is the prize after the best possible Brexit, when we will no longer be subject to European regulations, the vast majority of which we voted for or actively designed ourselves, and British companies will instead be perfectly free to manufacture flammable sofas. It’s just an unfortunate coincidence that the insurance company Liberty Special Markets last year announced that it was moving its headquarters out of Britain, to Luxembourg. There is no mandate (from the Latin for command or instruction) for any particular kind of Brexit similarly, if the referendum result had been broadly in favour of dogs, there would be no mandate for making a whippet rather than a lurcher prime minister. Claims that there is a mandate to reduce immigration or leave the customs union are similarly baseless, since no such topics were mentioned on the ballot paper. Owing to the impossibility of knowing the will of the people (qv), some now want to have a “people’s vote”. No one can be bothered with having a second referendum, but what kind of anti-democratic poltroon would deny a vote to “the people” on the final deal, ie a second referendum?No deal is better than a bad deal, May keeps insisting nonsensically, but the problem goes deeper: if you call everything a “deal”, like Donald Trump, you imply that complex international negotiations are no harder than haggling over a carpet. A treaty, on the other hand, sounds like it would be a lot more work, which is perhaps why David Davis eventually resigned.May’s favoured Brexit will be “smooth and orderly”. No one, presumably, is in favour of a rough Brexit, like a rough sea still less would anyone dream of a disorderly Brexit. Other things that are routinely called “orderly” are evacuations from buildings, military retreats and other ignominious withdrawals.Warnings that Brexit would be bad for Britain were christened “Project Fear” by leavers, who now feel vindicated because we haven’t yet plunged into the third world war. People sometimes triumphantly bring up the Y2K bug in this context, which is revealing, since that problem was solved by huge amounts of internationally co-ordinated computing labour. Meanwhile, just as “fake news” now means any news Trump doesn’t like, so “Project Fear” now means any true news about how badly things are already going.Barack Obama said that a post‑Brexit Britain would not immediately enjoy a dramatic financial bonanza from shipping megatons of American chlorinated chicken to its shores, but would be at “the back of the queue” for trade agreements. His successor, Trump, told the Sun that May’s latest Brexit plan would kill off any agreement, before rambling comfortingly that one was “absolutely possible”. This made many people nostalgic for the time when we were just at the back of the queue, rather than lost in a miasma of bullshit.The worst Brexit, we hear, would leave us a “rule-taker rather than a rule-maker”. The reason we were told we needed to leave the EU in the first place was that we were bound by diktats from Brussels yet now it is haplessly acknowledged that we had been a rule-maker all along (see Liberty). As Johnson discovered during his time as a journalist inventing nonexistent EU regulations, there is no cost to being a rule-faker.For some, Brexit was really about “sovereignty”, a sovereignty that Brexit itself proved we had always retained, or we wouldn’t have been able to leave. A clever new twist was offered by Andrew Marr recently, who said it would be only “fake sovereignty” if, post-Brexit, Parliament decided to keep a European regulation because not doing so would hurt trade. In the same way, I have only fake sovereignty over my own person if, when deciding whether or not to jump off a cliff, I am dissuaded by the prospect of injury or death. According to this serious new analysis, the only true sovereignty is that which encourages us to do the stupidest possible things.The Brexit-supporting press uses hysterically Leninist terms of abuse for judges and others who pedantically insist on law and process: they are “saboteurs”, or “enemies of the people”, or “quislings”, or “traitors”. The  recently announced solemnly that many in its readership think May is a “traitor”, to which one can only offer that venerable newspaper commiserations on the quality of its present readers.Brexiters claimed it to be intolerable that we were ruled by “unelected” Brussels bureaucrats, although the EU’s legislative body, the European parliament, is directly elected, while the European Council is populated by elected ministers from member states. Nigel Farage has failed seven times to be elected to the House of Commons.Jacob Rees-Mogg said that May’s Chequers plan was “the greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”, although the new Global Britain (qv) will not actually be a “vassal state” in the sense of that term long used in international politics – obliged to pay tribute to its protector in the form of cash and military assistance – nor will we have to pay the EU rent to live on these islands, like feudal vassals. Like many a stupid person’s idea of a clever person, however, Rees-Mogg is adept at using obscure words in the wrong sense.Spare a thought for the humble banger of tuned wooden bars, who like all travelling musicians will have a much harder time after Brexit ends free movement. As the composer Howard Goodall has pointed out, the increased bureaucracy, delay and fees for British musicians who regularly work in mainland Europe will “in effect choke off much of their livelihood”. Who will be left to blast out “Rule Britannia” on massed brass to entertain all the truck drivers stuck at Dover?When all else is lost, one can at least hope for a “youthquake”, of the kind that some said helped Jeremy Corbyn at the last general election, before we learned that youth turnout was actually lower than overall turnout. Happily, the Grim Reaper has not yet lost his job thanks to Brexit, so optimists forecast that as older Brexit-voting people die off and Europhile youngsters come of age, there will soon be a majority for remain after all. If we make Instagram-powered elections a thing, they might even vote.For a man who runs a social network, Mark Zuckerberg is quite shy and retiring. He has refused repeatedly to appear before the select committee for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to answer questions about possible connections between Russian intelligence, Cambridge Analytica and the Brexit campaign. In response to the continuing omniscandal over this as well as the Trump election, Facebook has said that fake news comes from both the left and right, and banning it “would be contrary to the basic principles of free speech”, ie Facebook’s profits. Zuckerberg’s own “mission” for Facebook, proudly declared last year, is to “bring the world closer together”. Isn’t he doing well?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/78e4c12eed8d8b8f1014a46c869a61787f291e39/654_757_5943_3566/master/5943.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a2a1f48ae21b32f518f6acb4aaba2f3","title":"chuck palahniuk interview adjustment day black ethno state gay parenting incel movement","story":"The American novelist talks about extremism, learning about failure from Brad Pitt, the power of protest – and why losing nearly all his money has been ‘kind of nice’First his father-in-law died of cancer. Then came the suspicion that his income for the last few years had been embezzled by an accountant at his literary agency. And to top off Chuck Palahniuk’s 2018 so far, there was the death of Anthony Bourdain – fondly remembered by Palahniuk for a TV show they made together in 2007, doing a gastronomic tour of the novelist’s hometown, Portland, Oregon. “It’s been a spring to remember,” he murmurs.I’d idly assumed that the author of Fight Club, Choke and other vivid studies of all kinds of American violence would be an expansive raconteur, maybe even a bit boorish and alpha. But sitting in the lofty space where he teaches writing in Portland, he is gentle and thoughtful, choosing his words carefully. “It’s looking like my payment for at least my last two – perhaps four – books has been taken, and so that leaves me with no reserves to write the next book,” he says. “Money seems to have been taken over such a long period that they haven’t even established yet how much was taken, and from what accounts.” Palahniuk says the accountant, Darin Webb, would lie, telling him that the publisher hadn’t made the cash available, or that he was preoccupied with caring for his mother who has Alzheimer’s. Webb was charged with fraud in May. Depending on the terms of his next book deal, and on how much money is recovered in a settlement, Palahniuk may have to sell his house to stay afloat.What does it feel like, suddenly being so financially precarious? There’s a long, silent look down. “It’s kind of nice,” he decides. “Writing was initially my way of saving money, because if you’re writing, you’re not spending. So it throws me back into writing. There are larger issues in life – the embezzlement is dwarfed by my father-in-law’s death. And there’s the awareness that I’m the person who got me to this place, and I’m still that person, so I can still turn it all back around, and come up with something really strong and vibrant and interesting.”He has already done so with his latest novel, Adjustment Day, a satirical fantasy in which, threatened with a new war draft, American society is overturned via an armed insurrection. As in Fight Club in 1996, there’s a band of disfranchised men who find brotherhood and identity in violence. It also shares that book’s moments of body horror: maggots devouring a dead man’s face a gross-out moment with a catheter. “I include those scenes so it’s not just an exploration of emotions and intellect,” he says. “It’s really rare that art affects us on a corporeal level – on a physical, gut level.”But Palahniuk moves on to fresh ground, too. Following the uprising, the US self-segregates into white and black ethno-states, Caucasia and Blacktopia, while gays and lesbians of all ethnicities take over California, renaming it Gaysia. The redrawn map is the starting point for an analysis of race, sexuality, class and nationality, with a few love stories chucked in between the bulging cast of characters. Credibility is stretched – at one point a voice on a radio announces “the joy of fiction is that it only has to smell true” – but the book remains rooted in real-world ructions.“Very little of what I do is invention – most of what I do is journalism,” he says. Doing research for the novel, he interviewed groups already advocating for American ethno-states, including the white American Renaissance. And California could break into three states following a referendum vote in November. Palahniuk sees Americans as being “out of love with a narrative of one great rainbow, and everyone being homogenised and allowed to live within this system”. His own experience growing up in the 1970s in the nearly all-white town of Burbank, Washington, was that “we still had a great deal of domestic violence and crime and suicide. I never bought the idea that a white ethno-state would be a Disneyland fantasy. But I am fascinated by the idea that isolation is the only thing that might allow us to create something new. Culture is developed in isolation, and what I’m wondering is whether in this very wired world, there won’t be a return to that isolation.” Journalists, incidentally, are among the most victimised characters in the book: the Adjustment Day uprising of the title is brought about by a social media poll of the least popular people in society, and journalists are some of the first against the wall. “I think Americans are realising that journalism is so partisan now,” he says. “They’re sick of that.”After Adjustment Day, Blacktopia quickly becomes a kind of Wakandan paradise, full of pyramid-shaped spaceships. “I have no standing or authority to say anything unflattering about the black ethno-state,” he says. “I’m white, so I could make the whites total dolts I’m gay so I can trash the gays.”Gaysia, then, doesn’t fare so well. Gay people who want to emigrate there when they reach adulthood can only do so if there is a straight equivalent wanting to emigrate from Gaysia, and the imbalance leads to thousands trapped in limbo, working in labour camps. It plays with what Palahniuk sees as a fixation on parenthood in the gay community. “There’s no art or music in Gaysia – all expression is the expression of having children. So much culture was created by gay people because they were trained to be observant, because everything that kept them alive was from observing how straight people were, and aping and mimicking those ways of being, so they would not be destroyed. They then used those skills of observation to execute beautiful things that served the overall culture. But having kids is a full-time job – it doesn’t leave you a lot of time to be a sculptor. I and a lot of people in my generation, an older generation, felt that gay people were having children as a means of expression, and giving up this incredible heritage of artistic expression.” Caucasia, meanwhile, becomes a feudal system in thrall to the beefy overlords who brought about Adjustment Day: an incel fantasy where women are utterly subordinated (at least for a while). I tell Palahniuk that I’ve seen incels – “involuntary celibate” men angry at their lack of sexual partners – quoting Fight Club as an example of why one shouldn’t underestimate ordinary frustrated men. He is amused, saying that the book was previously quoted by adherents to The Game, Neil Strauss’s guide to picking up women for emotionally unattached sex.“It’s fascinating that the group that can’t get laid is now adopting the same language. It shows how few options men have in terms of metaphors: a skimpy inventory of images. They have The Matrix – there’s a lot of red pill, blue pill stuff – and they have Fight Club. The only other thing is Dead Poets Society, where men go into a cavern and say poems to each other, and they’re not going to adopt that.” Women, he says, have more literature about female social structures, the likes of The Joy Luck Club or How to Make an American Quilt. “Those have a script and roles and determined ways of being, that women can adopt in order to be together long enough to share their lives.” Don’t men have sports or the pub, instead? “Those social groups don’t produce the memes and one-liners and metaphors.” Palahniuk doesn’t see Fight Club as particularly gendered anyway. “It was more about the terror that you were going to live or die without understanding anything important about yourself.”Where does he see the incel movement going? “It might be comparable to Valerie Solanas’s Society for Cutting Up Men, these very extreme feminist movements,” he says. “The extreme always goes away.” What about the recent clashes between the “alt-right” and the Antifa (antifascist) movement, disruption that feels part of the fabric of Adjustment Day? “This is just my gut reaction: we saw very little protest during the two Obama terms, largely because people were reluctant to protest anything when we had our first black president, for fear of being judged as racist, regardless of the issue. So we’ve had this pent-up need for protest, because protest is a way to discover one’s power and potential in the world, to do battle against something, and” – aside from Ferguson, Missouri, and the “quiet protest” of the Occupy movement – “we haven’t been able to do battle against the government for eight years.“My generation drew an enormous amount of strength from battling against Reagan and Thatcher,” he continues. “They were the perfect white parents for us to rail against, and helped develop a sense of ourselves as a generation. And Trump is white, straight, a combination of Margaret Thatcher’s hair and Ronald Reagan’s body – he’s the perfect guy to rail against.” Adjustment Day has several narrators, so it’s uncertain where Palahniuk’s own sentiments lie. To some, then, he will seem a mere provocateur, or even a troll, but in an age of dogmatism, there’s something refreshing about his poker face. “If I write something really didactic, it’s resolved, it’s gone,” he says. “But if I write something that people can really argue about, that thing is going to be in the culture for ever. For example: is Fight Club good or bad? It’s consensual, but it’s violence. I’m trying to create this dazzling spectacle that’s not meant to perpetuate or generate anything, but to be a sorbet that allows you to taste the next thing. To be a little more present in the next thing.” You don’t want to see resolution? “No. Especially in creative work, resolution is death.” Given his year so far, it’s a credo that he needs to believe in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2553efebe3db072d8e5b907f806a1f7d2c70964a/0_416_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cff5fb1c20daba836b91f35680e55156","title":"stacey cunningham new york stock exchange first female president","story":"She is the first woman to lead the New York Stock Exchange in its 226 years.

The bronze sculpture of a little girl defiantly facing off against Wall Street’s Charging Bull launched a million selfies and became an unlikely avatar of the #MeToo movement. Soon it will be transported a few hundred metres down the road in downtown Manhattan to confront another symbol of entrenched masculinity: the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Stacey Cunningham says she couldn’t be more delighted.“I think she’s fantastic,” says Cunningham, the 67th president of the NYSE and the first woman to head the male-dominated institution in its 226-year history. “For me, she is a message to iniduals, though.

The number of women running businesses, let alone institutions of the stature of the NYSE, is still small. And the number of women running the US’s top 500 companies – many listed on the NYSE – fell this year.The floor of the stock exchange itself is also still a sausage fest. It is less male than it has been in the past, but that is because the number of men has been hacked away by technology, not ersity. The majority of the women on the exchange’s floor seem to be working for the 30-plus media outlets based there.Cunningham, 43, has been at the exchange on and off (and mostly on) since the 1990s. She says her surprise at the attention her appointment has brought may be because, in retrospect, she has always been gender-blind.“I always liked maths, science and problem-solving, so I gravitated towards engineering,” says Cunningham, who grew up in New Jersey, the fourth child of six, three boys, three girls. (“I’m the well-adjusted middle child,” she says.) She says she is disappointed that more girls don’t go into science and maths, but in her own case it was the obvious choice: “I didn’t think about that at all.”She must have had to tune out a lot. She first entered the NYSE in 1994 as an intern, when she was one of about 30 women among 1,000 men. “I walked in and right away I fell in love with the place,” she says. The “energy and the pace” reminded her of her family. “What struck me right away was the sense of community.”After she graduated, she came back to the NYSE, working on the trading floor until 2005, when she took time off to complete a culinary training course. She then worked at a rival stock exchange, the Nasdaq, as director of capital markets, before rejoining the NYSE and becoming the exchange’s chief operating officer in 2015.She acknowledges that things have changed for women at the NYSE in the decades since she first worked here. For one, they have proper bathrooms. When she started, women had to make do with one tiny bathroom converted from a phone booth, while the men’s bathrooms had a palatial lounge area.But she never experienced the rampant sexism other women in finance have complained about, she says. “When you walked through a trading floor 20 years ago as a woman, there was a little bit of you that could feel the room looking at you,” she says. But she says she never experienced any behaviour that made her uncomfortable.“In my experience, if I said to somebody: ‘Hey, that’s not OK, too much,’ and I said it with a smile, too, then they knew,” she says, giving that tight little smile again. “Whether it was the language people used, or something else that I didn’t appreciate, I just made it clear where I stood and I felt that I was respected for it. I’m not saying that every woman would have had that same experience. I’m sure there are women who tried to draw lines and they were ignored. I was fortunate that when I drew lines people stayed outside them.”Cunningham takes over the top spot at a challenging moment for the NYSE. Some of that is on view during my visit. I arrive for the opening bell that marks the beginning of the trading day and is a fixture of the financial news cable TV shows. We are corralled into a holding pen in line of the TV cameras as Cunningham rings the bell, alongside executives from BJ’s, a discount warehouse retailer, who are celebrating the launch of its share sale on the NYSE.The mood is frenetic, celebratory, somewhere between a graduation and the start of a race. But the energy is inside the corral, generated by the people who work for BJ’s, the exchange or the media organisations that report from the floor. Outside the pen, the number of brokers employed on the NYSE’s vast floor is in the hundreds, not the thousands of years gone by. You leave with the impression things will be pretty quiet once the opening ceremony is over.Most stock trading is now done electronically, principally from a far less photogenic datacentre in New Jersey. Its critics claim the exchange is a dog and pony show – Disneyland for capitalism, a marketing exercise where CEOs can ring a bell and a few traders run about looking busy for the cameras while the algorithms do the real work.“That floor is a TV station,” says one senior Wall Street executive, who did not want to be named. “There is pomp and circumstance, but it’s nothing but a bunch of clapping seals.”Cunningham and the NYSE could not disagree more. Algorithms cannot compete with human discernment and experience, or with days of big news. Cunningham mentions the day of the Brexit vote, for example – the human touch helped calm jitters. People bring “judgment”, she says. “One analogy we often use to describe how people add to that equation is an airline pilot. So, a plane can take off and land without a pilot. You don’t need to have a human being in the cockpit. But that human being adds value, especially during the most tumultuous times,” she says.Frankly, however, the argument over whether or not the NYSE’s much photographed neoclassical facade is sheltering a marketing operation or a vital financial institution is the least of its problems.One issue for all the exchanges, but the NYSE in particular, is that there are fewer and fewer share sales like that of BJ’s. Big companies such as Uber, Airbnb and WeWork are choosing to stay private for longer, powered by huge piles of private equity money.The competition – and some investors – are pressing the NYSE and the Nasdaq on their fees, while the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the US’s main financial watchdog, has a pilot scheme under review that aims to assess how, and if, the complex system of fees and rebates the NYSE and others pay to brokers for trading on their exchange affects trading.Critics argue that the rebates on broking fees offered by the NYSE and others to encourage traders to use their market create a conflict of interest. They incentivise brokers to send their customer orders to exchanges that pay the biggest ones, even if their clients might be better served elsewhere.The two-year pilot, which has the support of some huge pension funds, would allow the SEC to assess their impact on how trades are made. But Cunningham says the scheme is poorly designed – it does not include the dark pools, for example – and the Nasdaq has hinted that it may sue to stop the scheme.It is a complicated issue, but one that will require Cunningham to spend more of her time in Washington.“The biggest worry for her is that the regulatory tailwinds are going the other way,” said Ronan Ryan, the president of IEX. Ryan, who runs a rival exchange that has been involved in a public spat with the NYSE over the fees study, says the NYSE is too dependent on the fees it charges for data and is on the wrong side over rebates.There is no air of crisis at the NYSE, which has dismissed IEX as an exchange with a “clearly failing” business model.And Cunningham does not believe the NYSE is in trouble. The financial world may be changing – and fast – but the NYSE remains the world’s most famous stock market. She is confident it can adapt and keep its pre-eminent position.“The future of equity markets is increasingly global, technology-focused and data-driven,” she said. In that world, she believes the NYSE “is uniquely positioned” to leverage its huge footprint, and technology, to stay ahead of the pack.On a brief tour of the recently refurbished NYSE – it looks like a particularly nice outpost of the luxury hotel chain W Hotel – we pop into a room full of portraits of past presidents – all pale males. One day, Cunningham will be up there, too. It is quite a first, even if she does not seem keen to acknowledge it. Perhaps Fearless Girl will ensure she is not the last."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a1856e4b2e283e11af3364374039c9cee275f8c/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=437c92844c33b0ef4c1a8c3d3e9bba6c","title":"weak pound helps lure record number of overseas visitors to uk","story":"Fall in sterling since the Brexit vote seen as a factor in rise to nearly 40m visits last yearSterling’s plunge after the Brexit vote helped attract record numbers of overseas visitors to Britain last year, according to official figures.The Office for National Statistics said visits to the UK by overseas residents reached 39.2m last year, while also finding more Brits than ever before heading abroad – suggesting hopes for a staycation boom may have been overblown.Helping hotels, travel companies and tourist attractions across the country during a broader slowdown for the British economy in 2017, the number of visits by holidaymakers, business travellers and people coming to see friends and family rose from 37.6m in 2016.VisitBritain said the country benefited from higher numbers of people travelling from China, the US, Australia and the Gulf states, while overseas travellers opened their wallets to spend more than £24.5bn. While London remains the most popular destination, visits outside the capital reached a record high of 16.5m last year, with tourists spending £7.8bn in other UK locations.Aside from direct spending, the government’s tourism authority believes visitors to the UK generate a total of £127bn for the economy each year. Alongside the rise in numbers from further afield, there was also an increase in the number of Europeans coming to the UK. Europe remains the most important market for the British tourism industry, accounting for more than two-thirds of all visitors.France was the number one country for visits to the UK, with almost 4m last year.Despite significant pressure on household budgets, with Britons facing falling real wages and the highest levels of inflation for five years triggered by the Brexit vote, the ONS said more Brits than ever before jetted off on holiday, went on business trips or visited friends and family abroad.However, the weak pound does appear to have discouraged Brits from shelling out for long-haul trips to destinations like the US, with the figures showing the first drop in overall visits from Britain for several years. In the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, visits from Britain fell to 3.4m, from almost 3.6m in 2016.Spain accounted for much of the increase in trips abroad, with visits to the most popular British holiday destination rising by more than a million to reach almost 15.9m last year. Holidaymakers and other British travellers spent more than £8.6bn in Spanish resorts, cities and regions last year.Sarah Coles, a personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “It goes to show that even when we are tightening our belts, we are unwilling to give up our holidays.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f9327029a24bb152cc84e957d1f6da0570becd/43_982_3554_2133/master/3554.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70ce164e352a47415db825eb0fcf95a5","title":"melancholy isolation pittsburghs parking lot attendants in pictures","story":"Given Pittsburgh’s poor public transport, many commuters choose to drive.

It was the title of a 1984 book by biologist Edward O Wilson, who claimed humans are genetically drawn to seek out and feel more zen in nature. In 2005, author Richard Louv proposed that not seeing your greens could cause Nature Deficit Disorder (NDD), a low-mood condition similar to Seasonal Affective Disorder (Sad).“Nature is good for us because humans are part of nature,” says Dr Miles Richardson, director of psychology at the University of Derby and founder of the Nature Connectedness Research Group. The science of why is down to a three circles model, where wellbeing is a delicately weighted balance between drive, contentment and threat. “Being constantly driven at work can mean our threat response is overactive, positive emotions are reduced, and we become anxious. Nature reduces sympathetic nervous activity associated with drive, and increases parasympathetic nervous activity associated with calm,” he says.  Relaxation comes whether you bathe in a forest or simply look at some roses – so it’s not necessarily being in nature that relaxes you, but feeling connected to it. “Simply noticing three good things in nature every day, such as a flower growing on the pavement, increases connectedness and, therefore, wellbeing,” adds Richardson. Light rightThere’s a reason that getting the window seat is such a big deal – it is, in fact, scientifically good for us. A study in the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine found that sitting by a window during your working day results in 46 minutes more sleep every night.Where windows-for-all isn’t an option, architects are plugging into the new trend for circadian lighting: LED systems that mimic the angle and colour of the sun to sync with our bodies’ awake and sleep cycles. “Evolution has led us to expect a bluer light in the afternoon and a redder light in the morning and evening. Manufacturers are starting to produce systems with wavelengths to echo this,” explains Joe Croft, head of environmental and sustainability at Overbury, a wellbeing-focused fit-out firm. Air-ratedPolluted air doesn’t just create temporary physical symptoms such as problematic skin, and irritated eyes, nose and throat, it also contributes to the risk of chronic illnesses – but new tech is assisting the fightback against bad air. “The world’s first smartphone with air-quality sensors was released in February. Soon, more and more people will have the technology in their pocket to measure the quality of air around them,” says Croft. Colour of creativityThe psychology of shades has been a talking, dressing and wall-painting point ever since psychologist Angela Wright identified how colour influences our reactions back in 1984. Today, much of the focus is on how our environment spurs creativity. Sensory “triggers”, such as different textures of materials, are thought to keep the brain engaged, improving our ability to access knowledge. The significance of colour is also now thought to vary depending on where you are. According to the Human Spaces report, creativity is best boosted by green and purple colours in the UK, red design accents in India and water features in Brazil. Immersed in waterThe effect of urban water on wellbeing is the very latest area of environmental research. While the value of green space is in no doubt – the charity Fields in Trust equates the health benefit of the UK’s parks to around £34bn – water features, such as rivers, are less well examined. A special project will look at how 18,000 Europeans’ lives are influenced by water, meaning we could soon be splashing around a new buzzword: blue health.Look out for Clinique’s “purity patrol” fleet, carrying commuters around London, Manchester and Birmingham in air-purified rickshaws from 19-21 July.

Whether the right was making the case for longer prison sentences or against the welfare state, the argument generally rested on the principle that we must stand by the consequences of our actions. To cite the context that shaped how a decision was made, insist on the parallel importance of collective responsibility, or expect the state to cushion the blow, were all signs of whiny weakness. To think otherwise revealed not just a flawed political philosophy but a lack of moral fortitude.But the new right, on both sides of the Atlantic, is increasingly behaving in precisely the manner for which it lampoons progressives. Its politics start from the point of victimhood. Its persecutors are many – the media, the elites, the liberal establishment, feminists, Muslims, migrants. In the past week alone the US president, Donald Trump, has targeted the media for both reporting him accurately in Britain (he was on tape), and failing to realise that he meant the exact opposite of what he actually said about Russia.The crimes of these tormentors are many: they are misrepresenting us, looking down on us, taking what’s ours, or in some other fundamental way undermining “our way of life”. Whether these grievances are real or imagined is less important than the fact that they are felt. Not long after a spate of racial clashes in northern England in 2001, some white people in Burnley said that Asians had better speed bumps – “like helicopter pads” – while all their own area got was “a lump of tarmac in the road … It’s because the council are scared of them”.This sense of victimhood and grievance provides some of the basis for the kinds of political realignments we are now witnessing. Recent research by Diana Mutz, a politics professor at the University of Pennsylvania, has shown there was little relation between voting for Trump in 2016 and having lost a job or income, or the density of unemployment or manufacturing jobs where Trump voters lived. There was, however, a propensity to vote for Trump among those who felt that “their dominance as a group was under threat”.For all the bellyaching about the left’s obsession with “identity politics” – a term now so maligned it can mean whatever you want it to mean so long as you don’t like it – the right has most effectively leveraged identity (rallying people through race, nation, religion, gender, myth and nostalgia) to political and electoral ends. “It used to be a pretty good deal to be a white, Christian male in America, but things have changed, and I think they do feel threatened,” Mutz told the New York Times.Since the repression of those who are not white, Christian or male provides inadequate balm for those who feel threatened – denying Muslims and migrants their civil rights, or women their reproductive rights, does not give anyone else more rights – these moments inevitably end with accusations of betrayal. Much is promised (“Take back control” … “Make America great again” … “Let’s take Finland back!”), but the lion’s share of what is actually delivered, beyond bigotry and bombast, is to the very elites who were invoked as a source of the grievance in the first place.The world of national sovereignty, racial purity and ethnic homogeneity is not coming back because it never existed and cannot be created from whole cloth. And so rather than take responsibility for the fact that the agenda they have embraced was opportunistic, flawed and destined for failure, the right’s most vocal practitioners absent themselves of all responsibility and instead cry “betrayal”.This is the stage we have now reached with Brexit. Rhetoric has come toe-to-toe with reality. Those who imagined that Britain is stronger than it is – that the European Union is weaker than it is, the Irish border would matter less than it does, and time would stand still while we worked ourselves out – find their imperial imaginations imploding under the weight of their own hubris. And so they plan to get their accusations of treachery, disappointment and disavowal in early,\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspavoid the rush.At this stage it is the government that they claim is failing to deliver the type of Brexit that voters wanted. It’s impossible to tell how they’d know, since the referendum only asked “remain or leave?”, giving no way of knowing precisely what people wanted beyond that. The accusation is also undermined by the fact that for the most part it is Tories accusing other Tories of betrayal. The former could get rid of the prime minister – either by challenging Theresa May internally or backing a vote of no confidence. But they have done neither, making them complicit in whatever “betrayal” now emerges.The accusers’ inability to rally significant numbers to their cause in parliament is due to the fact that the few proposals they have are even less plausible or popular than May’s. For example, neither David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, nor Boris Johnson, the former foreign secretary, produced a workable alternative in their resignation speeches and letters. “The problem is not that we failed to make the case for a free trade agreement of the kind spelt out at Lancaster House,” Johnson said in the Commons this week. “We haven’t even tried.” Quite what stopped him, as a leave campaigner, prime ministerial contender, or foreign secretary, from spelling out precisely what that case was is not clear.After the recent Chequers gathering, Johnson said that accepting May’s Brexit deal would be like “polishing a turd”. He has a point. It’s now painfully clear that whatever agreement is reached, it will satisfy few leave or remain voters. What Johnson does not acknowledge is that it is his turd. If he is incapable of clearing up after himself, the least he can do is not blame the stench on others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce3136943ead06235f6d327431f0a87741542334/0_74_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad5cf7db0e1daa83513568eec91e5865","title":"irish backstop brexit fudge theresa may chequers","story":"Theresa May’s speech in Belfast today has put the thorny issue of the Irish “backstop” back at the heart of the Brexit negotiations. Despite all the focus on ministerial resignations and parliamentary turmoil this week, it is the backstop – more than any other issue – that threatens a complete breakdown in the Brexit talks.The backstop – agreed in principle by the UK and the European Union in December – is designed to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Without the backstop agreed, no withdrawal agreement can be signed, and therefore no transition period can be implemented.The UK would crash out of the EU, creating chaos at the borders, increasing the cost of living for households, and throwing EU citizens in the UK and British citizens in the EU into limbo. Moreover, while most aspects of the future relationship can be resolved during the transition period after Brexit, the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has made clear that the Irish backstop must be agreed now. The stakes therefore couldn’t be higher.And yet when it comes to the backstop, currently the UK and the EU are at complete odds. The EU wants the UK to sign off on a Northern Ireland–only backstop. This would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs territory, its VAT area, and its single market for goods, in the event that no alternative trade or technical arrangement could be agreed to avoid a hard border.The UK, on the other hand, is implacably opposed to a Northern Ireland-only backstop, which would create a customs border in the Irish Sea. As a committed unionist, Theresa May has stated again today in unequivocal terms that no prime minister could agree to such an arrangement, however hypothetical. Just this week, parliament easily passed an amendment preventing the possibility. The Democratic Unionist party is particularly opposed – and of course its MPs are critical for the government’s survival.The UK government has, in turn, proposed a different backstop, in effect extending the UK’s membership of the EU’s customs union for a limited period until alternative arrangements have been agreed. On top of a customs union, the recent Chequers agreement proposes a “common rulebook” on trade in goods for the proposed future partnership. Taken together, the UK thinks these two proposals should be enough to avoid a hard border in Ireland.But the EU will see this as a British wheeze to extend the backstop to the whole of the UK, rather than just Northern Ireland, and therefore get preferential access to the EU market via the back door.For the EU, the UK’s proposal threatens its very integrity. If the UK stayed in the single market for goods without signing up to the free movement of people or services, this would undermine the inisibility of the four freedoms (goods, services capital and labour) – a core tenet of the EU’s single market.May’s first option is compromise. The UK could try to persuade the EU to agree a whole-UK backstop by extending the EU’s common rulebook to other areas of the single market – similar to the “shared market” model advocated by the Institute for Public Policy Research. This would be a sensible approach to the future partnership. But Barnier is unlikely to be sympathetic to applying it to the backstop. This is because the EU sees the backstop as an insurance policy, to be used if all else goes wrong. Brussels doesn’t want the matter of the Irish border to predetermine the entirety of the UK’s future relationship with the EU.So what can the prime minister do? The second option is to find a fudge – indeed, her biggest fudge yet. The government could agree the Irish backstop with the EU, but simultaneously include alongside the withdrawal agreement a unilateral declaration that the UK will ensure that it never needs to be used. This could help her save face – by committing in text to not using the backstop – while nevertheless giving the EU the assurances it needs to proceed with an orderly withdrawal.Another fudge doing the rounds is the idea of a “backstop within a backstop”. This would keep the UK’s option of a temporary customs union on the table but include the EU’s Northern Ireland-only proposal as a further fallback option if the UK’s ideas couldn’t be made to work in practice.But a fudge like this would put further pressure on May’s Chequers agreement – because under these circumstances she would be committed to doing whatever it takes in the next stage of the negotiations to avoid the use of the Irish backstop. This leaves the last option: dig in and hope for the best. This might be tempting for May – she may want to reprise her role as a “bloody difficult woman” in the Brexit talks. But there’s no sign yet that the EU is willing to budge on the backstop either. As the March deadline approaches, the risk is that by sticking to their guns the UK and the EU orce each other next year with no deal in place at all.• Marley Morris is senior research fellow and Brexit lead at the Institute for Public Policy Research"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/906278105bddc0dc05efab1beeb12416420c623f/1_0_4610_2767/master/4610.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=031245c7e3293643f471ef51e7717fbb","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

The public are being encouraged to take part in the Big Butterfly Count over the next three weeks to help experts see how butterflies are faring and to enjoy the mental health benefits of watching wildlife. The UK has experienced the right combination of a cold winter and a settled late spring and summer so far this year, enabling spring butterflies to thrive. The annual count could record a bumper year for species such as holly blue, common white, common blue and red admirals. But the ongoing hot dry conditions could mean plants wither away and the next generation of caterpillars cannot find the food they need to survive. Populations of butterflies collapsed as a result of the 1976 drought for this reason, wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation said. The Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation and sponsored by B\u0026ampQ, asks people to spot and record 17 species of common butterflies and two day-flying moths during three weeks of high summer. Mental health charity Mind is supporting the Big Butterfly Count as a “wonderful way of interacting with the environment” and championing the benefits of spending time in nature, which research shows can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety. And Butterfly Conservation president and veteran broadcaster Attenborough has spoken of the mental health benefits of spending time in nature, even at home watching garden wildlife. “I have been privileged to have witnessed some truly breath-taking wildlife spectacles in far-flung locations but some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I’ve been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do,” he said. “A few precious moments spent watching a stunning red admiral or peacock butterfly feeding amongst the flowers in my garden never fails to bring me great pleasure. “Spending time with nature offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life, it enables us to experience joy and wonder, to slow down and to appreciate the wildlife that lives side by side with us.” Attenborough also said the Big Butterfly Count, which involves spending 15 minutes in a sunny spot counting butterflies and submitting sightings online, can help gather vital information that may help protect them in the future. More than three-quarters of the UK’s butterflies have declined in the last 40 years, with some common species, such as the small tortoiseshell, suffering significant slumps. Attenborough said: “A cause for great concern over recent years is that many of our once common and widespread species like the large white, small copper and gatekeeper have started to struggle, mirroring the declines of rarer species. “Butterfly Conservation has also revealed that butterflies are declining faster in our towns and cities than in the countryside. “So please take part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer, we need to know, now, more than ever before, just what is happening to butterflies in our towns, in our gardens and in our countryside.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/23f610254e38cc7f11b03e7517ab9754a89c5831/0_546_3490_2094/master/3490.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76c0e45c835335ab29e0c484f763e92c","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"A newly discovered bandy bandy snake species, jumping sweetfish and baby tarantulas in Derbyshire are among this week’s pick of images from the natural world"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7477d0e0ae11750fbb2439c4fa6908716322dcc0/1053_1147_1575_945/master/1575.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c3d057c05023b7ba164895234b3478c9","title":"how to wear denim jacket jess cartner morley","story":"The denim jacket is fundamentally unimprovable, so never really changes, which is brilliantThis is not about whether you should buy a denim jacket you already have one. Check the boot of the car. Or that overloaded coat hook by the back door. Told you! The only reason you wouldn’t have one is if you listened to misguided people who tell you to detox your wardrobe and get rid of all the useful stuff in favour of obscure capsule “pieces” that are then deemed over six months later.The denim jacket is the opposite of a statement jacket. It is so far from being a “piece” that it’s almost invisible, in the same way that a pair of jeans almost disappears from view in a fashion context. It is functional and familiar and essential. You take for granted that it will be there when you need it, like ketchup for your fish and chips. The denim jacket is fundamentally unimprovable, so never really changes, which is brilliant, except that means it never feels terrifically exciting.But there is every reason to rekindle your love for the denim jacket. It is the perfect weight for a summer jacket, sturdy enough to keep out a stiff breeze, cool enough not to overcook you. And it doesn’t crease or snag or even look obviously dirty.But much more important than its practical qualities are its style attributes. A denim jacket is not smart, but neither is it silly. It is neither too masculine nor too feminine, but brings balance to whatever you wear it with. (See the tomboyishness it lends to a very feminine aesthetic: Nigella used to wear that look to great effect see also Marilyn Monroe in The Misfits.) It is also pleasingly youthful without being overly teenage. A floral dress that could look stuffily grown-up with wedges loses a decade if you wear it with a denim jacket and flat white trainers.Denim on denim gets a bad press, but it’s easier to wear if you mix up the colours and weights. Dark denim with white has a summery, nautical vibe that feels less deliberately hipsterish than Spears-and-Timberlake blue-on-blue. The classic blue is the number one choice if you are after an ugly trainerdad-core look, but I’m happy to pare things back to summer basics by teaming denim with gingham, broderie anglaise, white Converse. An indigo denim jacket is smarter than the traditional version, especially if the shape is neat. It’s also more all-weather, visually speaking: you can wear it with a black cotton turtleneck and black ankle-grazer trousers for an easing-into-autumn look. Perhaps you do need to buy one, after all.Styling: Melanie Wilkinson. Hair and makeup: Johanni Nel at S Management.

In many ways, Sorry to Bother You is very much a post-Get Out experience, despite the fact that Riley had been trying to make the film for more than 10 years (the screenplay was published in full in McSweeney’s Quarterly in 2006). “Unfortunately, the world hasn’t changed enough to make the movie irrelevant,” he told the audience at this year’s Sundance, where the film picked up the much deserved Vanguard award. “It’s of the time and the movement going on right now.” Both films are genre-blending comedy-horrors addressing heavy concepts such as systemic racism and oppression, the theft and repossession of black bodies by white America, the dark reality of labour in capitalist society and the way in which these villainous forces are disguised. Like Jordan Peele’s instant classic, Sorry to Bother You (directed by musician-turned-director Boots Riley) is a “social thriller” (a term first coined by Peele) where the villain is not just one person or family, but an insidious idea at the root of society itself.These movies ask the viewer: what if you found out you were living in silent solidarity with the most diabolical villains ever? Would you recognise it and would you do something about it? In Sorry to Bother You, Riley observes the many ways in which capitalism (and the forces that uphold it) manipulates, controls and ultimately destroys the inidual.Although Sorry to Bother You could be perceived as an allegory for slavery, the movie doesn’t poke at white guilt or mine it for punchlines as much as Get Out (remember Rose’s father: “I would’ve voted for Obama a third time, if I could”). Instead, with wit and wackiness, it scratches around at the idea of how readily we are all willing to ignore the obvious horror in front of our faces at all times.Set in Oakland, California, where writer-director Riley was born and lived for 30 years, the theme of rising rent, lower wages and fewer careers couldn’t be more relevant. Oakland and San Francisco are among the most expensive cities to live in the US, by a considerable margin. Cassius takes the telemarketing job out of desperate economic necessity: he is down and out and living in his uncle’s garage with his girlfriend (Tessa Thompson). Stanfield had previously appeared as the unsettlingly bodysnatched Andre in Get Out (“I find that the African-American experience for me has been for the most part very good”) but here his “white voice” is played for laughs: a code-switching nod to the likes of Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy who both did “white voice” in their standup routines, exposing some uneasy truths. In Sorry to Bother You, Glover’s Langston spells it out for Cassius: his “white voice” succeeds because it sounds like wealth – a cadence that rings with a happy-go-lucky economic solvency. “In America, you see people who are code-switching all the time,” says US writer and broadcaster Touré, “not to become some sort of Oreo but being able to adopt that sort of white voice to make white people feel comfortable and then being able to switch back and speak to black audiences and send the message of: ‘I’m still one of you.’ You see that in Barack Obama, you see that in Oprah Winfrey. I’ve never seen a film that deals with code-switching in such a great, subversive way. It’s important and valuable but also problematic and fraught with pitfalls.”The film’s “of its time” satire feels starker and more batshit than Get Out, too, possibly due to its timing. Although Peele’s film has been seen as a icy comment on Donald Trump, it was made in the Obama era and released in the States only a few days after Trump’s inauguration. Sorry to Bother You comes out at a very different time, in an era of child separations, the continued visibility of the “alt-right” and a toxicity around the word “immigrant”.Indeed, the stakes are naturally much higher for any “social thriller” that comes out post-Trump’s first year (see also: The First Purge). Speaking on the theme, Peele told Business Insider last year: “The best and scariest monsters in the world are human beings and what we are capable of especially when we get together.” His forthcoming film Us, featuring warring couples, one black (Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke) and one white (Elisabeth Moss, Tim Heidecker) follows this blueprint. “I’ve been working on these premises about these different social demons, these innately human monsters that are woven into the fabric of how we think and how we interact,” he said. This is where Sorry to Bother You is coming from, forming part of the “movement” Riley speaks about. In a New York Times profile of Stanfield, he is singled out alongside the likes of Donald Glover, Issa Rae and by implication Janelle Monáe, creatives who subvert the normal tropes assigned to black stars in the public sphere. “(Stanfield)’s interested in being weird and holding that space that, particularly for artists of color, hasn’t always been accessible,” Stanfield’s co-star Thompson told the NYT: “The folks that take that and own that, those outliers, are remarkable, and really important culturally.”In these terms Sorry to Bother You can be seen a victory lap both Stanfield and Riley have taken a cinematic universe most associated with surreal white auteurs such as Wes Anderson, Michel Gondry and Spike Jonze and repurposed it for an all-black cast and world in the same way that Get Out reignited the horror genre by bringing ersity into the room. By the normal rules of Hollywood, an oddball character actor such Stanfield would be relegated to a “kooky best friend” role, but in Riley’s universe he’s the lead. “To see this epic allegory about race is interesting,” says Touré. “In America we are constantly talking about race, even when we’re pretending that we’re not talking about race.” Sorry to Bother You is in cinemas soon "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75e86b6e2b5835e29004de95a9508a2526c9f1ea/0_183_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f73ab6e24d9e842254f056356967ae02","title":"international champions cup new markets europe","story":"With 18 teams taking part across 22 venues over the next few weeks the ICC continues to draw huge audiences and now features women’s games and a youth tournamentManchester United, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and 15 other heavyweight European teams. Twenty-seven matches staged in 22 venues on three continents. Inaugural women and youth team tournaments. More than 5m tickets sold and plans for a quantum leap in global sponsorship and TV coverage.In six years the International Champions Cup has fulfilled the vision of Stephen M Ross, the multi‑billionaire owner of the Miami Dolphins and Relevent Sports, the company behind the pre-season competition which begins on Friday when Manchester City face Borussia Dortmund in Chicago.As Charlie Stillitano, Relevent’s chairman, says: “When we started with Steve Ross he wanted it to be a global tournament that captured all the pre-season games for the major teams, which was quite a lofty ambition. I was cautiously optimistic because he had the resources to put his money where his mouth is.”The ICC’s genesis came as a replacement for the World Football Challenge, which began in 2009 and Stillitano believes that was a pivotal year.“One turning point came then because a lot of managers felt: ‘Well, you do some pre-season stuff but not a full-blown tournament because you’re not going to win anything in the season proper.’ That was the myth,” he says.“But to think where the ICC is now – 18 teams, 27 games, 22 different cities and three continents, I would never have imagined this six years ago.”The inaugural competition was held in 2013 and featured eight sides playing matches in the US and Spain: LA Galaxy, Real, Valencia, Milan, Internazionale, Juventus, Chelsea and Everton. This summer’s edition has expanded to include Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur, Paris Saint-Germain, Lyon, Bayern, Borussia Dortmund, Internazionale, Juventus, Milan, Roma, Benfica, Atlético Madrid, Barcelona and Real. Stillitano states that Ross’s investment is “beyond tens of millions” and reels off impressive ticket sale numbers.He says: “There were 492,000 sold in 2013, 642,000 in 2014, 985,000 for 2015, 964,000 in 2016 and 903,000 for 2017. And we think this year we’re on track for 1.1m.”That makes a grand total of 5,086,000, with 2014’s meeting between Manchester United and Real Madrid at Ann Arbour’s Michigan Stadium drawing a record 109,318 attendance for a stateside “soccer” game.The ICC’s grip on football’s summer season could, in time, reach to the women’s and youth game. At the Miami Dolphins’ Hard Rock Stadium on 27-29 July, City, Lyon, PSG and North Carolina Courage women will play semi-finals, a third‑place play-off and final.The ICC Futures began on Monday and runs for six days until 22 July: its ambassador is Alessandro Del Piero – a member of Italy’s triumphant 2006 World Cup team.“The response has been crazy – I think we’ll be turning teams away next year. Mr Ross has done a really good job of investing in this – you know he won’t get any of his money back on the kids and women’s side.”The flagship men’s event now encompasses North America, Asia and Europe – three of the world’s seven continents. Yet Stillitano and his boss, Ross, remain ambitious.“We’re really blessed – we virtually have all the big names of European football,” Stillitano says. “We needed to stabilise the business, make it global, and we have. What we are really trying to do to grow the tournament is to bring in global sponsors that go across the continents and we also see the next evolutionary step as TV.”“In the ICC everyone right now plays three games across the globe. You don’t have a knockout format because, for example, the French and English leagues start on different days and its impossible to co-ordinate that. Steve and other people talk of one schedule that everyone would live by. Again it’s a little bit of a holy grail but that would certainly be good for us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9a584680aa562a1a3df7e1ee50a49f0d5eb9efab/0_1127_7401_4440/master/7401.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc5909b40da1b2fef15ed7c7f94b584e","title":"cocktail of the week french martini","story":"Grape vodka takes the lead in this fruity sipOur take on the classic cocktail combines Ciroc vodka, which is made from grapes, with the sweetness of raspberry and the sharpness of pineapple.

Surely, if you thought about adulthood as much as I do – what makes a responsible human, a good friend and thoughtful citizen – you would (by now) have a sense of what obstacles you need to overcome, which milestones to reach or what skills to develop. Not me, though. Adulthood continues to elude me. (It’s one of\u0026nbsplife’s great mysteries, like who built the pyramids? And why do\u0026nbspmothers like Minions so much?)I’m not so naive as to think there is one prescriptive model of adulthood. And I know it doesn’t happen in a snap – like, one minute life is all sugar sandwiches and grazed knees, and then, bang, it’s quarterly performance reviews, smiling through a grimace and culottes.

I get too competitive with the game (that I am playing against only myself), so, when seeing someone else eyeing up a discounted trifle, I barge my trolley at speed right up to the reduced chiller so that I am physically blocking it (tick, for quick thinking!), before raiding the fridge in a\u0026nbspfrenzy, scooping up every single product without even looking, then running off in my flip-flops in case someone dobs me in.Later, when I’ve unpacked all the shopping, I\u0026nbsplook down and realise I’ve bought 26 pasties, a\u0026nbsptrifle, a\u0026nbspbag of spinach that’s already turned and a box of Farley’s Rusks.

Coco Khan picks out some of the bestA conversation can speak volumes and in the world of audio dramas, they often do. The audio drama – a piece of fiction told using several voices – is in the midst of a renaissance. Previously consigned to rare radio slots on rainy Sundays, audio dramas are now ubiquitous, buoyed by audience tastes for podcasts, and attracting some of the world’s most exciting writers and actors.These are professional, high-quality productions – think Netflix for your ears. And like Netflix, Audible has begun commissioning original audio dramas, making them free for members, putting an end to the bottleneck in which many creatives vie for one radio slot (and a broadcaster therefore has to pick the one with broadest appeal). Audio dramas run the gamut, whether you want a tear-jerking tragedy, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, or a heart-fluttering romance. With such variety, they make for perfect accompaniments to your summer holidays, whether you’ve got a long-haul backpacking trip planned, or a short and swift city break lined up.But with so many options, where do you begin?We picked out five of the best audio dramas from Audible, so you don’t have to. All you have to worry about is whether or not you can resist binge-listening your weekend away.The Child “My name is Simon. I’m 10 years old. I’m a serial killer.” So begins Sebastian Fitzek’s chilling tale of a boy who claims to have killed in a previous life. Set in Berlin, the story follows the child and the only people who believe his cryptic utterings – his mother and a lawyer she has hired. But when Simon’s knowledge leads to several bodies being discovered, the police start to suspect the lawyer. He must solve the crimes before the police put him in the frame, no matter what it takes. Fitzek is one of Germany’s most lauded crime-thriller writers and has seen his work translated into 20 languages. His talents are at their height in this intricate, spine-tingling adaptation. The fabulous narrators include Emilia Fox (Polanski’s The Pianist) and Rupert Penry-Jones (Spooks).Northanger Abbey If audio dramas are having a renaissance, Northanger Abbey might be the Sistine Chapel. A slick, star-studded adaptation of Jane Austen’s classic, this ambitious production has redefined audio storytelling – which is to be expected, given the cast. National treasure and Bafta award-winning actress Emma Thompson tops the bill, bringing Austen’s dry wit to life, while supporting performances from Lily Cole and Jeremy Irvine elevate the series to GOAT (greatest of all time) level. This coming-of-age story follows 17-year-old Catherine Morland through love, danger and intrigue, satirising the gothic tales that were popular at the time of writing, while taking a shrewd look at the British class system. Such skewering of high society feels as fresh as ever. Even those put off by historical drama will find joy in this.Neverwhere Nobody anticipated the impact the BBC’s 2013 adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s cult novel by the same name would have. Broadcast over six days, the production was a smash hit with Gaiman fans and non-fans alike, propelling the audio play into the public eye and showing just how exciting the form can be. Download to listen to Benedict Cumberbatch, David Harewood, James McAvoy and Natalie Dormer telling the story of Richard Mayhew, the unassuming Londoner who finds himself in London Below, a magical version of – and coexisting with – the real city, known as London Above. Originally conceived as a television series, Neverwhere lends itself to episodes, and so its separation into six parts feels natural and seamless. And on Audible it includes over 25 minutes of additional unbroadcasted material, including extended scenes, bloopers and outtakes.Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book: The Mowgli Stories One for the slightly older kids (and also the parents), The Mowgli Stories brings together all of Kipling’s tales about the boy raised by animals in the jungle. Though the average listener might think they know all there is to know about Mowgli from the much-loved Disney film, his adventure takes many more twists and turns. This retelling of the timeless classic stays true to Kipling’s darker side and the well-known cast, including comedian Bill Bailey and actors Richard E Grant and Celia Imrie, make this one unforgettable audio drama. A must-listen for anyone who has seen the film, and a brilliant, truthful, introduction to the work of Kipling for those who haven’t.Locke \u0026amp Key One of Audible’s first forays into commissioning original audio dramas is still among the most ambitious undertakings the form has seen. Locke \u0026amp Key began life as a graphic novel – so translating the form from highly visual to solely audio was no small feat. To do so, Audible drafted in Locke \u0026amp Key’s creators, Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez, to ensure the adaptation stayed true to its dark, terrifying roots. And it worked, assisted no doubt by the voice of scream queen Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) and Haley Joel Osment of “I see dead people” fame. Locke \u0026amp Key follows a family who, starting over after a tragedy, set themselves up in a quiet town that is also frequented by demons. A sharp production that will have you jumping out of your skin and sleeping with one eye open.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible - £7.99 a month after 30 days.

The almost entirely live jams of her new album, Qualm, are the best attempt yet to bottle that lightning they are likely to push her into clubland’s big league.This rise to prominence was not planned, though. “When I started, my ambition was only to play in this little bar around the corner every now and again,” she says. As a teenager in Hamburg, she was into Nirvana, the Stooges and her favourite band, late 80s British trance-rockers Loop – “just rocking out in my room on my own”. But when she went to a techno club at 17, her conversion was instantaneous and total. It does not take a musicology PhD to see why the grottier end of techno would appeal to a fan of the primal repetition of the Stooges and Loop – but at Hamburg’s notorious basement e the Golden Pudel she also found people whose ideas resonated with her. “I realised pretty quickly that the people surrounding the Pudel were pretty politically involved,” she says. “Not like a political party, but a kind of anti-capitalist idea, engaging with helping refugees, anti-gentrification demonstrations ...”Hauff began going to the Pudel, often nightly, and practiced DJing every day – “it is and was a total obsession”. Before long, she was a resident there. Then she began to make tracks live with vintage synths and drum machines, caught the ear of Darren “Actress” Cunningham and through him released an EP via leftfield electronic mainstay Ninja Tune in 2013. Since then, she has climbed the ranks, collaborating widely, getting to know the raving styles of crowds from Kent to Kyrgyzstan, but never altering her 80s90s style beyond a steady refinement of technique.She is not bothered if she is called retro, though: she speaks fondly of Dutch electroacid label Bunker never changing its electro sound because “they truly believe that is the ultimate sound: it might not have changed in 30 years, but it still sounds more futuristic than anything else. I can’t think of one thing that is new, really new – that isn’t in any way something that’s been done before.” Qualm is proudly straightforward, “a kind of strong, weird, one-drum-machine-and-one-synthesiser thing.”Hauff’s lightness of touch is refreshing.

After all, the place has all the trappings of countryhood. When I arrived at the airport, a customs officer in a Somaliland uniform checked my Somaliland visa, issued by the Somaliland consulate in Washington DC. At the airport, there was a Somaliland flag. During my visit, I paid Somaliland shillings to drivers of cabs with Somaliland plates who took me to the offices of ministers of the Somaliland government.But, according to the US Department of State, the United Nations, the African Union and every other government on Earth, I was not in Somaliland, a poor but stable and mostly functional country on the Horn of Africa. I was in Somalia.Even among unrecognised states, Somaliland is a special case – it is both completely independent and politically entirely isolated. Unlike South Sudan before its independence, Somaliland’s claim for statehood is based not on a redrawing of colonial borders, but an attempt to re-establish them. Unlike Taiwan, it is shackled not to a richer, more powerful country, but a poorer, weaker one. Unlike Palestine, its quest for independence is not a popular cause for activists around the world.The journalist Graeme Wood has described places such as Somaliland as the “limbo world”: entities that “start by acting like real countries, and then hope to become them”. What separates “real” from “self-proclaimed” countries is simply the recognition of other countries. There’s no ultimate legal authority in international relations that decides what is or isn’t a real country, and differences of opinion on that question are common. What separates the Somalilands of the world from, say, Sweden is that Sweden is recognised by its peers.Statehood may be a legal concept, but achieving it is an entirely political process. To the degree that foreign officials acknowledge Somaliland at all, they are generally sympathetic to its history and admiring of its recent accomplishments. Somaliland’s main obstacle is not the world’s animosity, but its indifference. Its current predicament answers the question: what would happen if you created a new country and no one noticed?Somaliland is pretty easy to get to. There are regular flights to the capital, Hargeisa, from Dubai and Addis Ababa. The city – a scruffy, sprawling town of cinderblock houses and potholed roads – feels coated in a fine film of desert dust. It’s usually extraordinarily dry, although periodic violent downpours in the rainy season leave the mostly unpaved streets damp and soggy. Camels are the traditional livelihood, food source and currency of Somali herders, and even in the big city, it’s not unusual to see them loping through busy downtown traffic. Food stalls crank out steaming, heaping plates of chewy camel meat (not bad) and thick, frothy camel milk (nauseating – to me, anyway).From other stalls, money-changers dispense grimy, faded bricks of shilling banknotes held together by rubber bands. When I was visiting, the shilling was trading at about 7,000 to the US dollar – although given that you can’t exchange Somaliland shillings anywhere outside Somaliland, I don’t exactly understand how this exchange rate is set. When paying for anything in a store with shillings, unless you know what you’re doing, it’s generally best to just hand over one of these bricks to the clerk and let him take out what he needs. Nowadays, most people are more likely to pay for basic goods and services by transferring cellphone credit.Try to book a hotel in Somaliland online from the US and you are likely to be referred to a travel advisory stating: “The US Department of State warns US citizens to avoid travel to Somalia because of continuous threats by the al-Qaida affiliated terrorist group, al-Shabaab.” But once you’re there, you quickly realise that such warnings are unnecessary. Hargeisa is one of the safest large cities in Africa, and, aside from the pollution and the traffic, there’s not too much to be concerned about when you’re walking around, although foreigners travelling outside the capital have been required to hire an armed guard since the killing of four foreign aid workers by bandits in 2004. There’s been almost no terrorist activity in Somaliland since 2008, when suicide bombers attacked the presidential palace and Ethiopian consulate. In contrast to the south, there is no pirate activity along Somaliland’s shores.Hargeisa’s main work of public art is a war memorial consisting of a stubby Mig fighter plane – a real one – shot down in 1988 and now mounted on a pedestal along the city’s main thoroughfare. Hargeisans will tell you, with some ironic pride, that their city is one of the few places in the world that was bombed by planes that took off from that same city. The event is part of a long chain of events, most of them tragic, leading up to the country’s strange current predicament.As the names of their countries suggest, there’s little ethnic or linguistic difference between the people of Somalia and Somaliland. The entity that today calls itself the Republic of Somaliland owes its existence to two main factors: its proximity to Yemen and its abundance of sheep. In the late 19th century, Britain (with the support of Italy) and France (with the support of Russia) were locked in a struggle for control of the Nile. As a means of both countering French influence and ensuring a regular supply of mutton for its garrison at the Yemeni port city of Aden, Britain signed a series of agreements with tribes in northern Somalia.In the words of the historian Ioan Lewis, “in relation to its size and significance” Somaliland was “one of Britain’s least rewarding possessions”. Yet there’s a good case to be made that its marginal status as a colony benefited the country in the long run. Whereas Somaliland had been considered a backwater by the British, and therefore left mostly to govern itself through the existing clan structure, Italy considered Somalia an integral part of its short-lived ambitions to build a north African empire that also included modern-day Libya and parts of Egypt.It shouldn’t be surprising that today the territory where the colonising power had more ambitious state-building goals is the more unstable. There is evidence from studies of regions of India and other parts of Africa to support the notion that postcolonial countries where colonisers had a lighter touch turned out better in the long term.As Somalilanders will often remind you, it was, in the past, an independent country, fully recognised by the international community, including the UN. But this halcyon period lasted less than a week. On 26 June 1960, the former Protectorate of Somaliland became fully independent from British rule, its independence recognised by 35 countries around the world, including the US. The next day, its new legislature passed a law approving a union with the south. On 1 July, Somalia became independent from Italy, and the two were joined together. It is a decision Somaliland has regretted almost ever since.Difficulties emerged almost immediately, and just a year after independence, voters in the north rejected a new constitution. The marriage was off to a rocky start. Things would go from bad to worse in 1969 when an officers’ coup brought a general named Siad Barre to power.The tensions within Somaliland society escalated as Barre’s long reign continued. Since independence, Somalia and Somaliland’s leaders have tended to favour members of their own clans and subclans with patronage. There are six main Somali clans, with dozens of subclans. The vast majority of those living in what is now Somaliland come from various branches of the Isaaq clan. The south is more heterogeneous. Barre may have espoused a doctrine of “scientific socialism”, a fusion of terrible governance ideas imported from China, North Korea and Nasserite Egypt, but he was not above ethnic nationalism, privileging his own Darod clan, which added to the resentment of the northern Isaaqs.During the 1980s, with support for Barre and his harsh military regime eroding, a primarily Isaaq northern rebel group known (somewhat misleadingly), as the Somali National Movement (SNM) emerged to challenge rule from Mogadishu. The crackdowns that followed simply added to the perception that the north was a region under occupation. This culminated in an all-out civil war between the SNM and the central government in the late 80s, during which thousands were killed and millions fled.On 18 May 1991, the SNM proclaimed that the region was re-establishing its independence, severing its ties to the south, and would now be known as the Republic of Somaliland. The world, for the most part, shrugged. The slow and steady process of state formation in the north would be almost entirely overshadowed in the international media by the chaos engulfing the south, particularly after an international intervention two years later led to the infamous “Black Hawk down” incident and the killing of 19 American troops during the battle of Mogadishu.So why has Somaliland been more successful and stable than its southern neighbour, even with virtually no assistance from the international community? The fact that is is largely populated by only one clan has helped it avoid tribal conflicts, unlike some other countries in the region. Most Somalilanders also point to the role of clan elders. In addition to a president and a traditional elected parliament, Somaliland has an unelected upper house of elders, somewhat similar to Britain’s House of Lords, which has a consultative role on certain legislation and is entrusted with settling disputes between the country’s subclans. “It’s the elders who really made this peace,” Mohamed Omar Hagi, a UK-based Somali activist, told me.Somaliland has also been lucky to benefit from the leadership of a few iniduals, most notably the country’s most prominent global advocate, Edna Adan. The most famous person in the country, she is generally just referred to in Somaliland as Edna. “We don’t have a George Clooney,” one local journalist told me, referring to the Hollywood star’s advocacy on behalf of South Sudan’s independence. “All we’ve got is Edna.”When I met Adan at the maternity hospital and midwifery school she runs in Hargeisa, which everyone just calls “Edna hospital”, she handed me her business card, which on the back features the caption “Where is Somaliland?” with an arrow pointing to the country’s location on a map of the Horn of Africa. Job one for Adan, who has travelled throughout the world, is simply telling people what and where her country is. “I can’t get anyone to come here,” she sighs. “The teachers and doctors cannot come to us because their governments tell them not to. I don’t know how you slipped through the net.”Adan’s office was decorated with photos of dignitaries she has met, from Hillary Clinton to Kofi Annan. The centrepiece was a striking photo of a very young Edna with her late husband, Mohamed Ibrahim Egal, at the White House with Lyndon B Johnson in 1968, when Egal was prime minister of Somalia.Adan was Somalia’s first qualified nurse-midwife, and the first Somali woman to drive. She spent years as a UN and WHO official before returning to Somaliland to build the hospital with her own savings for all its limitations on personnel and equipment, it is one of the premier facilities in the Horn of Africa. She’s been called the Muslim Mother Teresa for her work in promoting women’s health and campaigning against female genital mutilation. She also served for several years as Somaliland’s foreign minister, continuing to deliver babies while on the job.Although her political activities receive less attention than her public health work, Adan is also a tireless advocate for Somaliland’s independence. “For 25 years I’ve been waiting for the world to see how stable, peaceful and governable we are,” she told me, decrying what she called the “world conspiracy against Somaliland’s recognition”. Adan sees Somaliland’s unrecognised status as the main reason for its lack of economic progress over the past quarter-century.Non-recognition by western powers is having an impact on the status of women as well, Adan argued, saying that western countries’ lack of engagement was opening the door to the influence of fundamentalists from the Gulf. She pointed to an old photo of herself as first lady in a chic cocktail dress: “You see my pictures! We never used to cover ourselves from head to toe,” she said. “We had necks, we had hair, we were people. Others are getting into Somaliland faster than the west. And if that keeps on like this, heaven help us.”A large number of people are also dependent on $500m per year in remittances from the roughly million-strong Somaliland diaspora living for the most part in Britain, the US, Scandinavia and elsewhere in Africa. This isn’t unusual for developing countries, but officials are understandably worried that this flow of cash from abroad is a finite resource. Most members of the diaspora are refugees who left the country during the violence of the 1980s. Their children are less likely to feel the need to support aunts and uncles they barely know. “These offspring are now basically Americans or British or French or whatever,” energy minister Hussein Abdi Dualeh told me. “They don’t have the same attachment to the country.”With remittances likely to dry up in the coming years, and livestock an unreliable resource, the government is looking for other sources of investment, but Somaliland is a place with an image problem. “The name always scares people,” said Dualeh. “Anything that starts with ‘Somali’, no matter how it ends, is a red flag for a lot of people. But companies who are here realise it’s a very benign, very safe environment.”The twin hopes for the Somali economy are oil exploration – currently being carried out by a handful of hardier energy firms off the coast – and a plan by Dubai Ports World to develop the Red Sea port of Berbera, which could conceivably be an alternative means of bringing goods by sea into landlocked Ethiopia. But it’s hard to imagine that plan taking off without a serious improvement in roads and infrastructure, and that probably requires international investment.And for that in turn, once again, it would be helpful for other countries to know that Somaliland exists, and isn’t the same country as Somalia.One highly unusual feature of Somaliland’s situation is that it’s not actually looking to challenge the much-maligned borders drawn by Europeans across the African continent – it’s looking to restore them. “The international community said we seceded from Somalia. We did not. We already had our own nation,” said Mohammed Ahmed Mohamoud, AKA Barwani, a civil society activist and director of the Somaliland Non-State Actors Forum. “Our borders were established through an agreement between the Italian government and the British,” said foreign minister Saad Ali Shire. “It’s an internationally determined boundary.”Although it’s true that Somaliland voluntarily erased the border with Somalia in 1960, Somalilanders don’t consider that decision irreversible. As Somalilanders often point out, theirs wouldn’t be the first country to back out of a postcolonial merger. Senegal and the Gambia, a narrow strip of a country located completely within Senegal’s territory, were joined together as the confederation of Senegambia from 1982 to 1989. Egypt and Syria were briefly joined together as the United Arab Republic from 1958 until 1961, when Syria seceded. If these countries couldn’t make their marriages work, why, Somalilanders ask, should Somaliland be stuck in a loveless alliance?These arguments were hard to argue with in Hargeisa. But in the outside world, they’re unlikely to prove persuasive. For Somaliland, the frustrating reality is that the world map is preserved in place less by international law or even custom than by what’s sometimes called “path dependence” – the thousands of small decisions that, over time, lead to the creation of institutions, and that are very hard to unmake without massive disruption. Countries tend to stay the way they are, and people, with some justification, believe it would be awfully difficult and dangerous to change them.The last major wave of country creation took place in the early 1990sm as the end of the cold war hastened the breakup of the Soviet Union and the explosion of Yugoslavia. Since then, only a handful of new countries have joined the club – and many of them have struggled.The argument against Somaliland’s independence rests largely on factors beyond the country’s control. Somaliland officials are used to hearing that if their independence were recognised, it would set off a domino effect for nationalist movements, destabilising the continent. If Somaliland were independent, what would stop other regions from trying the same thing?International organisations such as the African Union and the Arab League are hostile to the idea of recognising further territorial isions. Countries wary of their own separatist movements don’t want to establish any sort of precedent. The UN, which has invested enormous resources in promoting stability and unity in Somalia as a whole, views Somaliland as a hindrance to those goals rather than any sort of beacon of stability. Somaliland’s neighbour Ethiopia mostly supports it, but given Addis Ababa’s wariness about its own Somali separatists, it likely prefers the status quo – a weak and ided Somalia – rather than a strong independent Somali state on its borders. The two most recent instances of country creation in Africa – autocratic, impoverished Eritrea and anarchic, violent South Sudan – have not bolstered Somaliland’s argument that its recognition would be a boon to regional and global stability.Western observers, both governmental and non-governmental, have generally been more positive. Noting that Somaliland, unlike most of its neighbours, has had several contested elections and peaceful transfers of power since independence, the US NGO Freedom House classified it as an “emerging democracy”, and it is the only country in its region considered at least “partly free” or higher on the group’s annual rankings.But even if non-African governments are, on the whole, generally sympathetic to Somaliland, it’s not enough of a priority to upset the status quo. Somalilanders like to joke mischievously that they have been too well behaved. After all, the other countries that have gained recognition in recent years have done so after wars and genocides.“Being a peaceful, democratic and developing state isn’t helping Somaliland gain international recognition,” said Hagi. “Somaliland is very quiet. It’s a peaceful place. The international community doesn’t really care about a peaceful place. When there is a problem in a country, the international community is always there – Somalia, Iraq, Syria, Libya. When there’s no problem there, there’s no point in coming to build a state.”Or, as Adan puts it: “At 78, I don’t want to face the possibility that everything I’ve been taught about democracy and human rights is wrong. Maybe I should just go join the Taliban.”They are joking, of course, but without some major turning point or dramatic shift in global priorities, it’s hard to see Somaliland winning recognition. The world will continue to defend an abstract principle of territorial integrity in the face of the clear will of the people of Somaliland.Recently, there have also been some troubling indications that Somaliland’s much-vaunted peace and stability might be more fragile than it seems. Dozens have been killed in fighting between Somaliland and Puntland – a neighbouring semi-autonomous region of Somalia – as part of a long-running clash over a disputed border region. Monitors have warned that the conflict risks breaking out into open war. The Somaliland government has also been condemned for detaining and harrassing journalists covering the conflict.For all its serious problems, though, it is hard to argue with Somaliland’s relative success. Perhaps this is the bigotry of low expectations, but whatever negatives you can say about the place, it’s not Somalia. With little help from the outside, Somaliland has had to do an awful lot on its own, and arguably done it better than many of its recognised counterparts.“In many African countries that have been recognised, they are still struggling,” said Barwani. “So, sometimes we say that maybe being a de facto state is better. Because many recognised states in Africa failed, and they became a one-party system of a dictatorship with no free media and no space for citizen participation. For us, we have so many things. No limitations, no restrictions.”Looking at the decades of support given by the US to dictators such as Mobutu Sese Seko, or considering the destabilising role of western oil companies in countries such as Nigeria, there’s a case to be made that if that’s what engagement with the outside world means for fragile African states, maybe Somaliland has been better off without it. If, at some point in the future, the world does decide to recognise its independence, bringing with it the attendant investment and diplomatic engagement, Somaliland will be in a stronger and more stable position to handle it. Shire remains optimistic that this day will come. “We’ve waited 25 years already.

It had been expected that the appointment of Dominic Raab to replace David Davis as Brexit secretary might raise the average IQ of the department by a few dozen points. After all, even appointing my dog – one of the dimmer creatures on this planet – would have been an improvement. But these hopes have been quickly dashed. Either there is something about the Brexit department that renders all ministers who work for it catatonically stupid or Raab is determined to live down to the standards of his predecessor. An act of kindness.What Raab does have, however, that Davis doesn’t, is a limited amount of self-awareness. He realises that the whole purpose of his job is that it’s entirely cosmetic. He’s not there to actually do anything. He’s there to give the impression that he’s doing something. The Brexit negotiations are far too complex to be left to any of the halfwits in the Brexit department. They’re also way too tricky for the prime minister and the civil service, but it’s they who are calling the shots and Raab’s main function is to do the photocopying and make the tea. Jobs he can just about manage. At his first departmental questions, Raab immediately set about proving his lack of credentials by declaring he was very much looking forward to Michel Barnier offering “his full support” for the Chequers white paper when they met later in the day. A curious reading of the situation, given that the other EU countries have been openly sniggering about the white paper’s faults for much of the past few days and were under the impression they were currently still negotiating the withdrawal agreement. Raab hadn’t got to where he had today by knowing what he was doing. Or what was going on. The ghost of Davis past.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, felt obliged to try a couple of questions on the viability of the Chequers agreement but he, too, was sweet-talked with meaningless circular arguments that went nowhere. A world of magical realism where everything could be simultaneously exactly the same and entirely different. Here and not here. Where there would be a Brexit idend even if the country was worse off because being worse off was a price worth paying for taking back control. It wasn’t just Labour that was getting fobbed off. Several of the hardcore Tory Eurosceptics were keen to make sure ministers were making detailed plans for their preferred no-deal Brexit. Absolutely, Raab insisted. The department had started thinking about it very hard a few days previously and had already come up with some nicely coloured wall charts he hoped would be made available to the public at some point in the future when it would all be a bit late. But it would still all be fine even if it wasn’t. At this point, Steve Baker, the former junior Brexit minister who had been Private Walker to Davis’s Captain Mainwaring and is now a self-appointed cheerleader for Boris Johnson, intervened to ask if his one-page masterplan – MY MASTERPLAN by S. BAKER. 1. Tell the EU to sod off. 2. Take back control 3. So there. 4. Panic – could be widely distributed around the department. Are you sure? Raab said. Wouldn’t it be less embarrassing if it was quietly fed through the shredder?  Baker wasn’t satisfied. It’s not enough for him to be thought an idiot. He won’t rest until he’s proved it. So he carried on, demanding also that the minister appoint a tame economist to rubbish the HMRC report that warned even a soft Brexit would cost the country jobs and money. Raab said nothing. It didn’t feel the time to point out Brexit had already cost Baker his job and there was every chance it would claim those of several more ministers. The sooner the better. For their sake as well as the country’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2087fc933062e8a54fc8186bf4211bfd1eb33191/0_288_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=984382250d51efaeed9237f1f440557b","title":"anna soubry accuses theresa may of capitulating to tory forces of darkness","story":"The Conservative rebel Anna Soubry has accused Theresa May of capitulating to “the forces of darkness” in her own party and warned that, as a result, she and her fellow soft Brexiters may not back the final deal the prime minister obtains from Brussels.The outspoken former minister accused Jacob Rees-Mogg’s faction of pursuing a hard Brexit that will cost “hundreds of thousands of jobs” and said they were “now running Theresa” because the prime minister was forced on Monday to accept their amendments to the customs bill.In an interview with the , Soubry pledged to carry on fighting for a soft Brexit but conceded that the balance of power within her own party had changed. An “ultimate elite, who are playing politics with real lives” had become dominant, she said.Soubry’s intervention followed a dramatic week at Westminster in which Conservative factions have openly battled for control while May tried desperately to keep her job and negotiate Brexit.On Monday, the Broxtowe MP made a barnstorming speech during the debate on the customs bill voicing anger at May’s decision to do a deal with Rees-Mogg’s European Research Group to head off a damaging rebellion. Until then she had supported the prime minister’s new softer Brexit strategy signed off at Chequers a fortnight ago.Reflecting on those events, Soubry said: “Since the referendum, the forces of darkness have taken over and they have continued to take over and this week if there was every any doubt who was running this government it was quashed.”The MP said she had been told by the chief whip, Julian Smith, on Monday afternoon that “80 Conservatives, including a large number of members of the government” had told him they would not support the customs bill unless May accepted ERG amendments.That would have been enough to topple a flagship piece of Brexit legislation, and forced No 10 to agree to the amendments, one of which was designed to frustrate her proposals for a customs arrangement in which HM Revenue and Customs could collect some duties on behalf of the European Union.The MP said she believed the ERG were “ruthless bastards that will stop at nothing” because they believe their “cause is bigger than anything else”. She added: “Now that the forces of darkness have got the prize in sight, they are going for it. I’m afraid that Theresa has embraced these people, they are now running Theresa”.ERG members and supporters include a range of Tory backbenchers, from veteran anti-Europe campaigners, such as John Redwood and Bill Cash, through to former ministers David Jones and Steve Baker, and young MPs including Andrea Jenkyns, who want to force out May. Its chair is Jacob Rees-Mogg.Soubry accused May and the whips of operating a double standard, saying that “Jacob Rees-Mogg gets his tummy tickled, when the ERG threatens to vote against a government bill unless it is amended on policy” .In contrast, when her ally Dominic Grieve “suggested parliament should have a vote in the event of no deal, which is process” he and his potential Tory supporters are treated differently: “You are threatened, you are called a traitor, you are threatened with deselection, threats the like of which have never been seen before.”But Soubry warned May that she and her smaller group of about a dozen “mutineers” had not given up and could not be relied upon to vote for whatever the prime minister brings back from her Brexit negotiations.The 61-year-old MP said her view of the tight parliamentary arithmetic was that May would have to rely on about a dozen or so Labour MPs to vote with her because she believed that a hard core of Tory ERG members would not vote for whatever was proposed.About five Labour MPs, including Kate Hoey and Frank Field, have consistently voted with the government for Brexit, but Soubry believes more Labour MPs would be needed for May to see off any Tory rebellions. “She is relying on Labour leavers beyond Kate Hoey, She needs the likes of Caroline Flint to get it through,” Soubry said.However, the MP conceded that her Tory remainer faction lacked the strength and discipline of the ERG up until now. She said that she and like-minded party colleagues “needed to grow a pair” because they failed to pull out or pulled back from the brink.Soubry said the remainers needed to muster 16 rebels if they were to defeat the government, assuming all the opposition parties voted alongside them: “We did have at least 16 when the EU withdrawal bill came back, and the big mistake was that we did not do what we said we would do, which was have a vote on the Kerr amendment, which was very tame. That is recognised as being a mistake”.If passed by MPs last month, the Kerr amendment would have forced ministers to explain what they had done to pursue remaining in a customs union.Despite her frustrations, Soubry said it would be “deeply irresponsible” for anybody to challenge May and accused the prime minister’s rival Boris Johnson of “naked, blind ambition”.She accused the former foreign secretary and his supporters as engaged in “willy-waving”, making light of the consequences of Brexit. “This is deeply grown-up, serious stuff. Egos and this sort of willy-waving ambition is deeply unacceptable.”The MP, who has a narrow maiority of 863 in her Nottinghamshire seat, said she had no intention of leaving the Conservative party, although she co-operates closely in parliament with pro-European Labour backbenchers Chuka Umunna and Chris Leslie on Brexit. “I shall be true to what I believe.

We want to have an ambitious partnership with Britain, we want to work with Britain on a trade agreement and on internal and external security because it is a very important partner for us.“But we have to protect the consistency of the single market and we have to make sure we keep our autonomy of decision.“We will work on the basis of our principles and see to what extent our British partners fully gets it, including the British parliament.”Brexit-supporting MPs also successfully forced the government to enshrine in law that the UK will not accept any deal involving a separate customs arrangement for Northern Ireland to the rest of the UK.The issue of avoiding a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland remains the most difficult in the talks.The EU has proposed a “backstop” solution, to be in place until a satisfactory free-trade deal or technological solution is found, under which Northern Ireland effectively stays in the single market and customs union while the rest of the UK leaves.On Friday, May repeated her belief that no British prime minister could sign up to such an arrangement, a position the EU believes amounts to backsliding on an agreement reached in December.Downing Street wants a UK-wide backstop – anathema to the EU – to ensure there will be need for a border in the Irish Sea.Loiseau said: “We want a solution which is consistent with the single market and with our rules. In December there was an agreement between our British partner on principles including the backstop if nothing else works. Until now we have not seen another solution that would be proposed and accepted by the 27.Barnier will spend two hours with ministers from the other 27 member states presenting his views on the white paper, and updating them on his talks on Thursday evening with the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd1a0a527be4300e5485691944d59ca8c89764e3/0_212_5568_3340/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=68d0b61752601a9051ae2b1eaafbd477","title":"hoffenheim lewis hamilton mercedes ferrari","story":"There was, understandably, something of a celebratory air about Mercedes here in Hockenheim before they had even turned a wheel in anger at their home grand prix. The team had their man, they were pleased to announce on Thursday – Lewis Hamilton had finally put pen to paper. With the protracted wait for the British driver to renew his contract for a further two years concluded, there was an atmosphere of optimism and anticipation of greater glories emanating from the Mercedes motorhome.The four-times world champion has taken three of his titles with Mercedes and expectations of further success are entirely realistic. But this season they are in the toughest fight they have encountered and, if the good cheer is to continue, the team need to step up now. Hamilton admitted in Germany they had to do better. “We’ve not won enough races this year,” he said. “We’ve done a really good job but we’ve definitely stumbled plenty of times. A small stumble this year is magnified because it’s so close.”Hamilton manages himself and negotiated his own contract but now his focus is on the business in hand. There is a tough race ahead in Hockenheim and, while it may not be decisive in the championship battle, there is no little weight to the outcome of the German Grand Prix.They return to a track where the British driver won at the last race here in 2016. That season his team were dominant and Hamilton was untouchable at Hockenheim, with Ferrari left scrabbling in their wake. Sebastian Vettel was a full second off Hamilton’s pole time and could finish only fifth in the race, more than 30 seconds back.This year however Vettel and the Scuderia will be expecting much more and, if anything, the pressure is on Mercedes to perform in a race that increasingly looks like a must-win. Vettel leads Hamilton by eight points in the world championship, a slender margin and one easily surmounted but it is how he has taken the lead that is of import.Vettel won in Montreal, a power circuit that Hamilton’s team have previously controlled in the turbo-hybrid era. This was warning enough that the simple equation of Mercedes having a clear advantage\u0026nbspat the high-speed tracks and losing it on the more downforce-dependent meetings simply no longer applied. At Silverstone this was driven home with some force when Vettel took the win in Hamilton’s fiefdom – where he had won the previous four races.What was already a tight fight has been compounded by errors from Mercedes. A software miscalculation lost Hamilton an almost certain win in Australia and the decision not to pit under the safety car in China was equally costly.In Austria a similar choice not to pit Hamilton under the virtual safety car lost him the lead, leaving the driver angry and frustrated before both he and teammate Valtteri Bottas, who also extended his contract for a further year on Friday, were forced to retire with mechanical problems.To be fair the team have called it right as well – keeping Bottas out in Baku was brilliant if ultimately thwarted by a puncture. With the margins exceptionally fine, these are the moments that will make the difference. The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, was blunt in his assessment that lost points were “down to our own mistakes”.Wolff also admitted they had to perform “damage limitation more often than we would have wanted”. This is not a task the team has been familiar with.Hockenheim then is a chance to steady the ship. It is broadly a power circuit, with the first half of the lap dominated by medium-length straights and this year will be quicker than ever. Once again Mercedes will hope to have an advantage and to make use of it but it is far from a given.Vettel’s win at Silverstone was not solely down to Hamilton being clipped by Kimi Räikkönen on the opening lap and the victory illustrated just how strong Ferrari are. In relative pace terms Silverstone has been their least competitive circuit for the past two seasons. This year Hamilton had to pull out an exceptional lap just to claim pole. The upgrades the Scuderia brought have worked to great effect and they are functioning as a unit with a sharpness that has exposed and exploited any weaknesses Mercedes have shown.Vettel believes he can take the title if they maintain their momentum. “We must keep pushing the development of the car, put ourselves in a good position to have something to fight with,” he said. “Last year the season got away from us because we weren’t strong enough.”For Wolff and Hamilton, further success together in the future will have framed the contract talks but the team principal knows just how important it is to perform in the here and now at Hockenheim. “We perceive this as the biggest challenge we have had so far,” he said of Ferrari’s form this season.Hamilton is more than aware of this, and making his mark on the dotted line ends only the speculation, not the very real challenge he faces. “There’s no questions lingering around so for the team it’s a positive,” he said in Germany. “And we need any positive we can get to fight for this championship.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c623bbb756fe5b107ab9fe2ca92f0aadd8ddd1a/5_158_2925_1755/master/2925.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09ed1fb98102eabe5c39d51aaf7daaf6","title":"india rani rampal interview hockey world cup england","story":"Standing on the banks of the River Thames, Rani Rampal has tears in her eyes. With the Hockey World Cup starting on Saturday, we are at a photoshoot with all 16 captains, but in a quiet corner away from her rivals the Indian captain is reflecting on the journey that has led her to London.We’re talking about her first coach, Baldev Singh, and these are good tears, the ones that creep up on you when laughter and goosebumps aren’t enough as she remembers the barriers that inadvertently helped her to become a genuine superstar of the game: at the age of 23 she is already a veteran with 134 goals in 212 international appearances.“I always thought about quitting hockey because of the poverty but Baldev helped me a lot,” Rani explains. “He’s very proud now. Whatever I am today is because of him. He worked so hard for me. He knows everything about me, where I come from, and he helped me off the pitch as well. So whenever I talk about him, I feel like: ‘Oh my god.’ He’s like god for me. Now I’m getting emotional.”India start their World Cup campaign on Saturday against hosts England, with the match at the Lee Valley Tennis and Hockey Centre in London’s Olympic Park a 10,000 sell-out. It is a far cry from her humble beginnings – Rani grew up desperately poor in the small town of Shahabad, about 120 miles north of Delhi, and lived in a single storey of a house with father – a cart puller – her mother, her two brothers and their wives and children, with her uncle and his family on the floor below.Simple things were a struggle. Waking up on time for Baldev’s 5am training sessions before school became an ordeal as the family could not afford a clock. “My mum did not sleep very much because she was worried about me being late,” says Rani. “She would get an idea of the time from looking at the sky and judge when it was 4am to wake me up.It helped that shortly after that episode her school ran a handwriting competition with the winner earning a small alarm clock. “My writing was terrible, but I practised and practised and I won it. So then my mother could get some rest.”There were a number of other issues. Temperatures would sometimes reach over 40C so training time was limited. Shoes and sticks were too expensive and had to be borrowed from coaches and team-mates. But by then Rani had already overcome her biggest challenge, simply convincing her family to let her play sport.“When I first asked to play hockey my parents immediately refused because I was a girl,” Rani says. “Every day I cried in front of them and told them I would treat my children the same way. For three years they didn’t trust me in\u0026nbspcase I did something wrong to bring\u0026nbspa bad name to the family. India\u0026nbspis a male-dominated country\u0026nbspand nobody prefers women to play sport or go out from the house. My parents are not educated, they can’t even write their own names, so it’s very difficult for them to understand about sport. I said: ‘You should give me one chance,’ but my neighbours and relatives told my parents it would bring them a bad name because I would be wearing a skirt or shorts.“Now the same people talk to my parents and always say ‘we are so proud of Rani’ and they send their kids to play hockey. My parents now say that if they made one decision in life that was good, it was to allow me to play hockey.”That decision certainly paid off. Her talent was quickly recognised and she was called up to India’s 2010 World Cup squad aged just 15. She finished the tournament as the second-highest scorer with seven goals and was unsurprisingly voted the young player of the tournament.Rani is one of just two current India players to have World Cup experience after the nation failed to qualify in 2014. She has been pivotal in their recent success: key goals against Italy and Japan helped India qualify for the 2016 Olympics – their first appearance since 1980 – and the Asia Cup victory last year was a major confidence boost for a team that is still part-time, with most players holding down jobs with Indian Railways.At the Commonwealth Games this year India came from behind to beat England – ranked No 2 in the world and full-time athletes – in the group stage. Their meeting on Saturday will go a long way to establishing whether India can achieve their ambition of reaching the knockout stage, with USA and Ireland also in the group. “I think England have more pressure than us so we want to enjoy the game,” says Rani. “For three weeks a sports psychologist worked with us in Bangalore and that has helped us to believe in ourselves.”Rani’s parents will be watching, from the comfort of their new home. “Last year I bought them a house and whenever I go there, I am so happy,” Rani says with a beaming smile. “They will watch the World Cup on television but they don’t know how to use smartphones so I can’t call them on Whatsapp – I have to call someone else if I want to speak with them.“They worked so hard for me, struggled a lot with poverty and so now it’s my duty to do well for them so they can enjoy the rest of their lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2f23f491b97bfd55d4873936c1d7935f3ee0f5b7/734_699_4042_2425/master/4042.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b18fc66b523e3e758dc18f9976d6409e","title":"fun frivolity watching tour de france in pictures","story":"By the time the Tour de France finishes in Paris on 29 July, millions of fans will have lined the 2,000-mile route.

He’s left with a long putt across the green for his bogey ... and he leaves it a good five feet short. He doesn’t make it, and the triple almost certainly costs him weekend participation. He’s +4. A 73 for Russell Knox, and at +4 the home favourite will also likely be packing his bags. And finally Tiger, who had hit two lovely shots up the hole, leaving himself a straight six-footer for birdie ... but he shoves it right. After taking an age to size it up. He’s overthinking some of these putts, it’s not the first time he’s done that this week. Another 71, and he’s level par.Sure enough, Sergio chips up to three feet. A stunning effort to save his skin. That would have been some story, had that one gone in! But it’s not to be. In goes the par putt: +4 most likely won’t be enough to survive the cut. Though at the Open, you never know. Meanwhile back on the 1st tee, Rickie Fowler, an absurdly talented eternal bridesmaid, a man we’d all like to see win that elusive major. Hmm, we’ve been here before, haven’t we. New Sergio cracks an iron down the middle of the fairway, and sends his second to five feet. Attaboy, Rickie, to borrow a phrase from Butch Harmon.Sergio’s coming up 18. After making a double on 16, he’s likely to miss the cut: he’s +4. Ah, he’s certain to miss the cut, because he’s lashed his second out of rough into the Barry Bur... hold on! The ball clanks off the far wall of the burn and somehow balloons back out onto dry land! He’ll still have to hole out from 60 yards if he wants to stick around for the weekend ... let’s face it, there’ll be no Carnousite redemption for the man who had a putt here to win in 2007 ... but at least he’s left with a Hail Mary. And memories of one of the most outrageous shots you’ll see at this hole for a while!The defending champion Jordan Spieth is out. And he’s just hoicked a Tiger tribute drive into the deep rough down the right of 1. But he’s got a decent enough lie, and the hot summer’s ensured this rough isn’t quite as thick and lush as it could be. So he sends a wedge over the flag and it lands softly, 15 feet past the pin. After yesterday’s one-over 72, he doesn’t need to rush ... but he wouldn’t say no to an early birdie.And with that, John was gone. He didn’t even say goodbye. They always leave! Sniff. Anyway, news of the US Open champion Brooks Koepka, who sent a gentle fade into 18, his ball screeching to a halt 18 inches from the pin. That’s a birdie to close, and he signs for an excellent 69. At -1, he’s not out of this yet. Especially as Kevin Kisner was unable to get up and down from the sand at 8. It was all he could do to splash 20 feet past the flag he couldn’t make it coming back. He’s back in a tie with Zach Johnson at -6.Kisner’s lead may not be too long in lasting. He pings his tee shot on the eighth to go into a bunker that looks deep and soggy. He can only chip it into an none-too promising position on the green. Up ahead on the 17th, Matshuyama goes ahead of Tiger and Knox and shows them where not to go in veering very close to the high rough. Knox’s shot is safe enough, and Tiger, mindful of the Barry Burn hazard, punches one low but not too long. Oh Tiger! He gave himself too much to do off the tee and from the bunker and couldn’t make par. A shot that falls short and wide leaves him back at par. Kevin Kisner takes the lead! Sinks a birdie at the seventh to go -7. Elsewhere, Tiger was indeed in the bunker and got himself out of it with an expert piece of sand management that suffered from a lack of belief. He may yet save himself a par on 16th. Matshuyama is on a charge, and takes a birdie. He’s on +1 now. Gordon Lilley emails in. “With his horrible 70s hairstyle, Fleetwood looked like a wet iel being interviewed on Sky. I hope he didn’t smell like one.”Tiger is wild at off the tee at 16 and wallops the ball into what looks like either deep rough or a bunker to the right of the hole. Up ahead, Padraig Harrington, a previous winner at Carnoustie, will not be adding to his two Opens. He finishes at the 18th on +8. A rueful grin and some handshakes with his playing partners and it’s time to think of the next one. Koepka, on par, is at the 18th. So far, the US Open champion - double US Open, in fact, has not been able to land too many blows on the leaderboard. Joint-leader Kisner’s tee shot on the seventh is straight and true. His second is much the same, though he is conservative in not trying to get too far left. He has a long one for birdie. As Tiger feared, his long putt to the 15th is beyond his ken, and he will have to settle for a par. Tom Watson, meanwhile, has been praising his “testicular fortitude’ for coming back from all his troubles. Matshuyama misses his birdie, but sinks his par. At -2, he is suffering on the jaws of death. If later starters pick up scores, he will be in trouble. Tiger hits a fine shot to the 15th, but he wants more as it fails to bounce on close to the hole. He will be even more frustrated now after Matshuyama did precisely what he was attempting to set up a birdie chance. Meanwhile, Van Rooyen is back on -3 after another bogey that is actually something of a saver considering the predicament he got himself into. Zach Johnson, the clubhouse leader, and joint-leader at -6, talks of how “grinding it out is part of the day”, and suggests bogeying the first set him straight for the rest of his round. Bit of banter about he and his housemates in a golfing frat houseexecutive Airbnb are playing soccer. Those guys! Matshuyama eagled the 14th to go -2 and took himself into the territory of not having to pay cancellation fees for his weekend digs. He has the honour at the 15th and shows Tiger the way with a fine tee shot. Tiger follows up with similar. Danger ahead still, though, with Tom Watson, a winner here in 1975, on TV describing Carnoustie’s as the toughest run-in to the clubhouse in golf. And Tom knows these things. Van Rooyen’s run may really be at end. The t-shirted one (it’s probably a very expensive polo shirt) drills into a bunker on the 10th. Meanwhile, Tiger is going for eagle, an uphill putt that looks straight but the lie takes him to the right. He will have to settle for birdie, his fourth of the day and now lies at -1. Barring accident, he will back the rest of the weekend. And Phil Mickelson joins Tiger at -1, having birdied at the fourth. Tommy Fleetwood has been chatting after his -6 today.  It’s no course record but it will do for today. I can’t lie about it. If I could pick one tournament in my life to win, it would be the Open. I’ve never been anywhere near before. We’re only halfway through the tournament unfortunately. There’s no point thinking about the end game. Thirty six holes is a long time. Today’s been a round where I’ve put myself back in the tournament and I’ve just got to move on from there really. If I can hit it like I did today, then obviously I’m going to have a lot of chances coming in over the weekend and we’ll see where that takes me.Tiger is smiling. A beauty of an iron shot and a smidgeon of fortune gives him a lie good enough to be well within distance of landing an eagle on the 14th. Here’s how it stands at time of writing. It now looks as if the later starters may be in clover at the weather, even though it is still drizzly, clears up.-6: Z Johnson (F), Kisner (5)-5: Fleetwood (F)-4: McIlroy (F), van Rooyen (9), Finau, Lombard-3: Chappell (6)Michael Kim missed a par putt on the 18th and finishes at level par for the first two days. Tiger steps up to the par 5 and drills a fine shot down the centre of the fairway. Kisner joins Johnson on -6 after holing his birdie on the fifth. Having saved himself at the last and taken that from the rough, Kisner’s short game looks bang in good nick. Tiger tried to dink his second shot with delicacy, but over-amped it. The ground didn’t help him, and he faces a tough recovery for par that he lands. That was a flash of the old Tiger, saving himself with a putt of precision and judgement. He enjoyed it, too, giving a trademark low-slung punch of the air. Van Rooyen, meanwhile, misses his par put and drops back to -4, despite togging down to a t-shirt to play it. Kisner’s saver at 5 is very special from the deep rough. Van Rooyen scoops out from the rough and lands in the centre of the fairway. Yesterday, that might have bounced on. Today it splats into the undergrowth and his calls for an extra bounce go unheeded. Van Rooyen’s run may be at its end. His tee shot on the ninth is blammed into the wilds, and he calls out in exasperation. Tiger takes on the par 3 13th and he is even angrier, reverting to the third personchannelling Earl Woods with “Tiger, no!” He didn’t make the bunker but is instead in a hugely unhelpful lie just above it. Knox shows him how it’s done with a shot that deserved better. It was killed dead once it landed on the sodden green. Kisner, deep in the chaff at the side of the fairway on the fourth, plays a fine shot at the and may be able to make a birdie on the fourth. Tiger, meanwhile, lands par on that 12th with a calmly cued effort and so does Knox. Determination apparent for both Jason Day’s fairly forgettable round ends in a missed birdie but at -1, he is sat OK. Van Rooyen’s long putt at 8 goes close to giving him a share of the lead, but it doesn’t sink. Tiger takes on that monster of a putt, right from one lip of the green to that on the other side but won’t be collecting birdie. He’s close enough to get par on a very difficult hole, though. The umbrellas are up, the stands’ seats need a good wipe if anyone is to sit down and there is a mist in the air but Erik van Rooyen’s birdie putt at 7 puts him into a joint-second -5. Kevin Chappell also lands a birdie on the first. Russell Knox, playing to stay in the draw for the weekend, is as at +5 after his great form at the Irish and Scottish Opens, and is playing alongside Tiger on the 12th. His second shot doesn’t get the desired bounce and plugs into what is becoming very heavy turf. Tiger goes next and at least lands on the green, but is at completely the other side from the hole. Woods continues to keep the driver in the bag at the 12th and his safety-first policy pays off. Danny Willett, sporting the type of trousers popular among youths who hang around shopping centres, booms a long putt on the 6th, but misses and must settle for a bogey to drop back to -2. Phil Mickelson meanwhile, the man in black today, lands a birdie on two. Here’s how it stands at the top of the leaderboard.-6: Z Johnson (F)-5: Fleetwood (F), Kisner (2)-4: McIlroy (F), van Rooyen (3), Finau, Lombard-3: Willett (5), StoneMolinari’s rescue mission on 18 fails as he misses a birdie and he will have to sign off at level par. He lost three in the final four holes, and he doesn’t look too satisfied with that. It now looks like +3 will be the cut-off point and Justin Thomas’ miss on 18 means he is on the very edge. Tiger is well within that at +1, but fancies moving further up the field. And he gets there, by rolling in a beauty on 11. There is a grimace of recognition and perhaps ambition. Van Rooyen rims a putt that would have taken him to -5, but has to claim par on the sixth hole. Molinari, after his double bogey, plays a decent bump and run to the final hole. He has chance to pull off a birdie to partially repair the damage. Big Phil Mickelson misses a putt on the first that would have claimed a birdie. He takes par instead, and looks a little miffed with the rainy conditions. It’s belting down. Waterproofs the order of the hour and that browned surface is beginning to green up. Tiger takes his second on 11 and lands a decent shot on to the green before retreating under an umbrella. Fancy some golf nostalgia? Then read on.“Oh no,” says Tiger off the tee at 11. But his panic is unwarranted. It lands safe enough to the left of the fairway. His loss of primacy is shown by a fading inability to judge where the ball will actually land. Francesco Molinari has just had a nightmare on 17th, having been plugged in a bunker and needing to play two shots to get out of it. He also missed his saver putt. Having been up with the leaders, he is back at level par. Tiger almost pulled off an amazing birdie from a fair way out and has to settle for par. That would have been some rescue job, but he wears an expression of disappointment, having thought it was rolling in. At +1 he will stay. Meanwhile, Scott cannot follow Johnson in for birdie on the 18th and has to settle for -1Zach Johnson on the last drifts in a decent shot to the dance floor, but has a long enough putt for birdie and to take the lead at -6. On the same hole, Adam Scott, at -1, looked unimpressed by his second shot, but it spins off the rim of the green and is sat very well. But Johnson holes out to go to -6 and take the lead. Having started with a bogey, he can make his way to the clubhouse in comfort. Looks like he’s missed the worst of the weather.

Three weeks later he changed his mind and spent the next three years working full time and racing as an amateur to get back to the pros. 2016 was his first year back and since then he’s finished 9th at the Tour of Flanders and finished the Tour De France.”It’s a good yarn: he spent three years working in a warehouse for Oxfam, but decided “after three weeks in a normal job” that he wanted to return to cycling. It’s been a long road back. There’s an interview with him from 2016 here.88km to go: The front four currently have a cushion of 2min 5sec.90km to go: The full results of the day’s intermediate sprint at Saint-Quentin-sur-Isère:And then, about 1min 45sec later:5. Alexander Kristoff (11)6. John Degenkolb (10)7. Peter Sagan (9)8. Andrea Pasqualon (8)9. Arnaud Démare (7)10. Edvald Boasson Hagen (6)11. Koen de Kort (5)12. Dion Smith (4)13. Darwin Atapuma (3)14. Tobias Ludvigsson (2)15. Lukas Pöstlberger (1)92km to go: Though it appears to have been around for a while I just saw this advert for the first time during ITV4’s coverage. I think it’s the first time I’ve been mentioned by name in an advert.96km to go: “There was lots of security on the mountain yesterday but it’s impossible to police all 13km,” writes Tim Pile. “Netherlands police were on hand to assist their French counterparts at Dutch Corner but those clad in orange are mostly big cycling fans I don’t think they would do anything to risk the riders safety. The idiots appeared to be tourists rather than lovers of the sport.” That’s obvious, I think: if you care for cycling, cyclists or other people in general you don’t blind them and impede them.98km to go: De Gendt pulls away in the final metres to win the sprint.100km to go: The front four have a lead of precisely two minutes. Really nothing much has happened today. A bloke looking was a highlight.106km to go: The peloton rides alongside the Isère river. “All this about the very sad retirement of Vincenzo Nibali reminds me of Andy Schleck,” writes Paul Wright, “who crashed into a Spectator in London and whose retirement was permanent.”108km to go: It is 31C in Valence today, and storms are forecast. Not a drop of rain has fallen on this year’s Tour, and today could be the day (though it looks to me like they might get away with it, with the worst of the weather due overnight).112km to go: The leaders head into Saint Quentin Sur Isère for today’s sprint. The peloton cycles past a man looking at a noticeboard on a wall. Not everyone’s interested in the cycling but it’s really something to totally ignore the Tour while standing five yards away staring at a wall.116km to go: “It’s not uncommon for French supporters to attack non-French favourites on the Tour (there are no French favourites),” notes Geof Walker. “I saw this last time it passed near me. Mountain stages worse. Difficult to police.”118km to go: The riders are just going through Sassenage. “A charming city that has preserved its village spirit,” apparently.124km to go: The front four have a lead of 1min 45sec, and it has been falling of late.125km to go: Meanwhile, this is from Gary Naylor: “I’m calling enough on fans’ behaviour on L’Alpe d’Huez. If these were French riders being treated like this, L’Equipe, the gendarmerie, even Macron would do something about it. Are they waiting for a rider to be paralysed or killed? Take the fans off the mountain.” I’d go for a middle way: a complete ban on flares, and better and better-policed barriers in areas of particular concern.126km to go: A couple of contrasting opinions on fans and riders. “The tour is not the best cycling race by any means,” says Bo Re. “It is often mundane and calculated. however the emotions of the riders and fans make it a full-on sporting drama. No doubt there will be calls for crowd control, a ban on flares and indecent clothing et cetera. I say keep it dirty and rude, it is really the biggest plus point for the tour.”133km to go: The riders will soon head into Grenoble, birthplace of Chelsea’s Olivier Giroud. Grenoble is twinned with Oxford.135km to go: De Gendt is first over the top of the hill, collecting two points while Scully snaffles a single.137km to go: The leaders are about to go over the day’s first climb, the category three Côte de Brié.This is probably fair. Police, organisers, fans and media all share a bit of blame for Nibali’s broken backbone.140km to go: Schar and Claeys have caught Scully and De Gent to form a four-man breakaway, about 3min 20sec ahead of the peloton.148km to go: Back in the peloton, the GC favourites appear to mainly be chilling and chatting. Geraint Thomas is having a rum old chinwag with Matt Hayman. 150km to go: Scully and De Gent have a 40-odd second lead, with Michael Schar and Dimitri Claeys attempting to chase them down, and the peloton a further 30sec behind.There is an early kind-of-almost breakaway, involving Toms Scully and De Gendt, with Sylvain Chavanel somewhere between them and the peloton, trying to catch up. Here are some screengrabs of the Nibali crash. Looks like the camera was OK, but the strap snapped. Accidents happen, it’s all part of an event which covers thousands of miles and at which part of the appeal is how close fans can get to the competitors, but this is just so chuffing stupid.168km to go: And they’re off!So it looks like Vincenzo Nibali was taken out yesterday by a spectator’s camera strap, which dangled in his path and caught on his bike. You can see it happen (very briefly) in a video on Eurosport’s website here. Really, though, whoever set off the flares that blinded the riders immediately before the incident must share the blame. Nibali paid with a fractured veterbra, and is out of the Tour.The roll-out has begun, with actual racing set to get under way in 10 minutes or so.Well, wasn’t yesterday fun! We had hills, spills and thrills aplenty and at the end of it Geraint Thomas secured another stage win and became the first Briton and the first yellow jersey-wearer to win on the Alpe d’Huez.Today’s stage is very different: 169.5km, with two smallish climbs, the category three Côte de Brié and the category four Côte de Sainte-Eulalie-en-Royans, a sprint in the middle and another at the finish, which after the withdrawals of Mark Cavendish, Marcel Kittel, André Greipel, Dylan Groenewegen and Fernando Gaviria will sadly happen with hardly any sprinters. Here’s what the stage looks like, and once again hello!Here are our reports on yesterday’s 12th stage, and on Geraint Thomas’s continued insistence that Chris Froome remains boss man at Team Sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42c7d848eedfeb44c7e06037f475ea94d3934b90/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=688ff991c0d1b41024eb36bbe607ea5f","title":"why donegal is the coolest place on the planet","story":"The long-overlooked north-west corner of Ireland has finally started getting its dues. In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

Maybe it’s timely then that the Upside’s editor, Mark Rice-Oxley, has been discussing the purpose of our series and of solutions-based journalism in a new podcast. This week we renew our efforts to find stories that might restore hope and inspire action amid the storm.Earlier this year we reported on the New Zealand company trialling a four-day week without changing wages.

Well, those results are in: Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from Dunedin on how it went. In picturesque Penzance on Britain’s south-western tip, residents had grown tired of the daily tide of plastic flotsam washing up on their spectacular beaches. So they rallied, and together achieved something remarkable, as Simon Usborne found out. Britain has long had a problem finding organ donors, particularly from its black, Asian and ethnic minority communities. As a report reveals the extent of the problem, Nishtha Chugh writes about his research, which has uncovered several solutions to this matter of life or death.Finally, in Canada, amid efforts to tackle the roots of homelessness, one group has come up with a practical solution to a problem that often dominates the lives of street sleepers: where to keep their belongings. This New Yorker piece unpacks the question of whether the world is getting better or worse, and why our perception can become destiny. And this Huffington Post piece looks at Vienna’s successful social housing system.Our firm went to a four-and-a-half-day work week in 2001. Everyone is paid for five. We all leave on Fridays at noon. We have suffered no loss in productivity, earnings or profits. We’ve had workers come and go but most have stayed and all make more now than they did in 2001, including the company.

They are invisible all over the world, where it is estimated there are 250 million children with developmental delay or disability. The numbers are thought to be probably twice as high in the developing world as they are in the more prosperous countries of North America and Europe.“Zika affected probably a relatively small amount of children – a few thousand. The epidemic came and went and hasn’t come back,” said David Edwards, a professor of paediatrics and neonatal medicine at King’s College London. It was a tragedy for each of them and their families, he said, but the numbers “pale into insignificance compared with the large number of children who are affected by neurodevelopmental disorders.” The two most common causes of death and disability in newborn babies are birth asphyxia and prematurity. Well-equipped modern hospitals in the western world can prevent much of the death and damage from these causes. But women in poor countries may have far to go to reach a maternity unit and can have very long labours. A colleague of Edwards working in Uganda told him: “We think 12 hours is a long labour. They think 12 days is a long labour.”Many women in developing countries are malnourished, which increases the risk to mother and baby. Genetic factors causing such disorders as Down’s syndrome and fragile X play a part in all countries.Some of them, from the poorest families, have parents who work and older siblings are charged with looking after them. “We have children taking care of children,” she said. “It is too difficult for them.”She and Edwards were part of an expert group brought together to discuss childhood neurodevelopmental disorders in Brazil by the UK’s Academy of Medical Sciences and the Academia Brasileira de Ciências at a workshop in Rio de Janeiro. The group’s report calls for more to be done for the invisible children not only in Brazil but around the world.In Brazil, they identified a need for more diagnosis and assessment, as well as the collection of better data on how many children with neurodevelopmental disorders there are. Children’s doctors need to be trained to diagnose babies and healthcare workers need to be able to offer support to families. The Zika crisis in Brazil and the fear it might spread around the world through mosquitoes and even, potentially, sexual transmission brought resources and expertise into a neglected area and has now shone a light on other damaged babies, says the report. “The identification and inclusion of ‘invisible children’ into the public health system has been an important consequence of the crisis,” it says."},{"url":null,"title":"it s a huge find megalithic passage tomb discovered in co meath","story":"  July 16, 2018Archaeologists uncover burial chambers on historic Br\u0026uacute na B\u0026oacuteinne heritage site   July 19, 2018Department warned against changes to house built above 5,000-year-old tomb "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3571307.1532089086!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit theresa may calls for eu to evolve position on unworkable backstop","story":"UK prime minister Theresa May has said that a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland \u0027cannot happen\u0027 after Brexit.  Video: 10 Downing Street\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t British Prime Minister Theresa May, takes a question from journalists after delivering a speech in Belfast. Photograph: EPAAidan CrawleyBritish prime minister Theresa May has reiterated her rejection of the Brexit backstop proposal and challenged the European Union to respond to her White Paper on Europe which she described as “principled and practical”.And in her speech in the Belfast Waterfront Hall on Friday and with senior DUP politicians in the front row she emphasised that her government would never be “neutral” on Northern Ireland’s union with Britain.In December the EU said it struck what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar described as a “bullet proof” backstop deal whereby in the absence of an overall UK-EU accommodation that Northern Ireland would remain in the customs union and have access to the single market while Britain would be outside such an agreement.On Friday on the second and final day of her Northern Ireland visit she reiterated that she could not accept this interpretation of the December deal because it would mean the creation of a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“The economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal ‘third country’ customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept,” said Ms May.“And as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either,” she added.She challenged the EU to reply to last week’s British government White Paper that proposes a free trade area in goods and agricultural products between the UK and the EU. She said it represented a “coherent package” and a “significant development” in the British position.“Early in this process, both sides agreed a clear desire to find solutions to the unique circumstances in Northern Ireland through a close future relationship,” said Ms May.“It is now for the EU to respond, not simply to fall back onto previous positions which have already been proven unworkable, but to evolve their position in kind,” she added.“The White Paper is our plan for the future. It is the way to the stronger and brighter tomorrow that I know awaits the whole United Kingdom. Now we must have the courage and the determination to seize it,” she said.Ms May said the White Paper proposals “will also protect and strengthen our union by ensuring there is no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and no border in the UK”.With DUP leader Arlene Foster and colleagues Nigel Dodds and Emma Little Pengelly in the audience Ms May spoke about her commitment to the union and how her party’s name was the “Conservative and Unionist Party”.“And, as we leave the European Union, I have made protecting and strengthening our own precious Union, by making sure the deal we strike works for every part of the UK, an absolute priority,” she said.“I believe in the partnership of our four great nations in one proud union and I want it to endure for generations to come. So a government I lead will never be neutral in our support for the union. We will always make the case for it,” she added.Ms May said she also respected that a substantial section of the Northern Ireland population identified as Irish and aspired to a united Ireland.“I will always govern in the interests of the whole community in Northern Ireland and not just one part of it,” she said. “We are absolutely committed to parity of esteem, and just and equal treatment irrespective of aspiration or identity.”On the possibility of Ian Paisley being suspended from the House of Commons for failing to disclose two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan she was asked was she worried about losing one of the 10 DUP MP votes that are propping up her government.She sidestepped the question saying it was a matter for the House of Commons to decide what penalty should be imposed on the North Antrim MP. She also said the confidence and supply agreement with the DUP was “delivering key decisions that are important across the whole of the United Kingdom”.Earlier on Friday Ms May met a Sinn Féin delegation led by party leader Mary Lou McDonald, who said the engagement was “anything but reassuring”.“In fact it’s now clear the British prime minister has come here to pick a fight with Ireland and to pick a fight with the EU,” said Ms McDonald.After Ms May’s later Waterfront speech Ms Foster welcomed her comments about the union. She described Ms McDonald’s complaint as “nonsense”.Ms Foster agreed with the British prime minister, saying it was now up to the EU to come up with “innovative and flexible solutions” on the hard border question.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

You can’t take back your waters and then expect to use other people’s sky.”The UK tabloid, which has a circulation of 1.6 million, chose to interpret this as Mr Varadkar threatening to ban air travel in revenge for British Prime Minister Theresa May stopping Irish fisherman accessing UK waters.It quotes the vocal pro-Brexit conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg as saying: “His words are those of an airhead.”The headline does not appear in the Irish edition of the paper which, although owned by the same organisation, has its own newsroom based in Dublin.An article on the Irish Sun’s website takes a more sober tone. “Taoiseach warns a hard Brexit may mean planes leaving the UK may not be allowed to fly over Ireland airspace”, the headline reads.An editorial inside the UK version of the paper also calls the Taoiseach “a fool” and “a bigmouth” and said his “latest tantrum exposes Brussels’ intentions to keep us in its grip.”It continues: “Imagine the cataclysmic self-harm of Ireland preventing planes from its biggest trading partner flying over it. And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.“Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.”The Sun, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch, has been one of the most pro-Brexit newspapers since the UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016. It has previously attacked the Taoiseach and other Irish politicians over what it sees as their intransigence on Brexit negotiations. Previous editorials have called Mr Varadkar “gobby” and told him “shut your gob and grow up”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

They drift among the summer blooms: wings as delicate as lace and patterned with the precision and brilliance only nature can conjure.My lavender patch teems with small whites, dotted with two beauty spots like grand 18thcentury dames. The occasional holly blue also flits lazily across the lawn.If I move too close to try and see precisely how the butterflies slurp up nectar through their tongues, they rise up and flutter around my head like confetti. ‘Stay near - me do not take thy flight,’ implored William Wordsworth in one of the versions of his poem, To A Butterfly. ‘A little longer stay in sight’. This weekend marks the beginning of the Big Butterfly Count: a three-week nationwide survey where members of the public are urged to spend 15 minutes helping record 17 different species of our most common butterflies in whatever location they wish. Since being launched in 2010 the survey has become the largest of its kind in the world. While ostensibly intended to record the health of the nation’s butterflies – themselves powerful bioersity indicators – it also provides a chance to spend some time reconnecting with the everyday, often overlooked, nature all around us.As Sir David Attenborough, the president of charity Butterfly Conservation which organises the survey, said today: “spending time with nature offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life, it enables us to experience joy and wonder, to slow down and to appreciate the wildlife that lives side by side with us.”The veteran broadcaster said he has been privileged to travel the world recording nature’s most awe-inspiring spectacles, yet simply sitting in his Richmond back garden watching the red admirals or peacocks has provided some of his most “memorable experiences” of the natural world. Sir David Attenborough, president of Butterfly ConservationThe extreme weather this year adds an extra sense of urgency to the count. While the scorching summer of 2018 has so far meant butterflies are flourishing, there are fears that should the drought continue it could lead to a catastrophic decline in populations next year as the greenery on which their caterpillars feed will wither away.While the past 40 years have witnessed a general decline of 46 per cent of Britain’s most common butterfly species following intense periods of drought such as in 1976 or 1995 the numbers have plummeted even more dramatically the following summer.   According to Richard Fox, associate director of recording and research at Butterfly Conservation, the best way to encourage butterflies in your garden is to allow herbs to flower as they provide wonderful sources of nectar. He also suggests making space to allow butterflies to breed by leaving a patch of grass to grow long and wild in the summer months. Aside from that, though, all you need to do this weekend is stop, sit, and watch…A red admiral on a thistleA large dark butterfly with a broad crimson stripe across its wing and marbled white tips. Red admiral numbers have increased threefold since 2015 and last year recorded its best big butterfly count ever with more than 73,000 seen. Previously just a summer migrant to the UK, our run of recent mild winters (excluding this year’s big freeze) has meant the butterfly is choosing to overwinter in Britain.  Where to spot?  Nectaring on garden buddleias or flowering ivy and on rotting fruit.Comma butterfly on English lavenderAn orange and brown speckled butterfly most easily identifiable by its distinctive ragged-edge wings designed to allow hibernating adults to conceal themselves among dead leaves.The species has a flexible life cycle, which allows it to capitalize on favourable weather conditions. Following a calamitous decline in the 20thcentury is now widespread and expanding northwards. Since the 1970s the comma has spread north by 250 miles. Where to spot? Open woodland, wood edges and patches of scrubland.A newly emerged Gatekeeper perching on a leafOf ruddy golden hues with a little black spot in the corner of each wing, the gatekeeper is also known as the hedge brown. Easy to spot as spends much of its time basking with its wings open to better soak up the warmth. Although still one of our most abundant butterflies its numbers have still fallen 44 per cent since 1970.Where to spot? clumps of flowers grow in gateways and along hedgerows and field edges. Favourite nectar sources include Wild Marjoram, Common Fleabane, ragworts, and BrambleThe Holly Blue is easily identified in early spring, as it emerges well before other blue butterflies. It tends to fly high around bushes and trees, whereas other grassland blues usually stay near ground level.  Where to spot?Gardens and urban areas. Perhaps our most spectacular butterfly, it takes its name from wings designed in a kaleidoscopic pattern of eyespots designed to scare off predators – blue tits are a particular menace. Where to spot?The peacock\u0027s strong flight and nomadic instincts lead it to range widely through the countryside, often finding its preferred habitats in the shelter of woodland clearings, rides, and edges.Knife attack on German bus: At least 14 wounded in stabbing in city of LuebeckComment: Should we defend little Montenegro?

That\u0027s not my job. It is what it is, Coats said in a verbal shrug.I don\u0027t know what happened in that meeting.Coats said he was just doing his job when he quickly issued a statement Monday after the president appeared to give credence to Russia\u0027s denial of election interference. In that statement, Coats restated the US intelligence assessment about Russian meddling and Moscow\u0027s ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy.I just felt, at this point in time, that what we had assessed and re-assessed, and reassessed ... still stands and that it was important to take that stand on behalf of the intelligence community and behalf of the American people, Coats said.As he spoke, news was breaking out of Washington that Putin had been invited to the White House this fall. NBC\u0027s Andrea Mitchell, who was moderating the event, shared the development. Coats said it was news to him.Say that again, Coats said, cupping his hand over his ear.He took a deep breath and continued, saying: OK.That\u0027s going to be special, he said, prompting laughter from the audience.Trump and Putin | In talksCoats, who has criticised Russia for years, has had to clash loudly with Trump\u0027s pro-Kremlin remarks, leaving the soft-spoken spy chief in a tight spot. Asked how he deals with Trump\u0027s conflicting statements about Russia, Coats said: This is the job I signed up for.The former Republican lawmaker was banned from traveling to Russia in 2014 for calling out its annexation of Crimea. He has continued to raise the alarm on Russia since his appointment by Trump as intelligence chief in March 2017.He said he understood what Trump was saying when he noted earlier this week that others could be to blame for trying to meddle in US elections because other adversaries have the capabilities to do so. But he stood firmly with the intelligence assessment, saying it\u0027s undeniable that Russia has taken the lead on this kind of interference.Basically, they are the ones that are trying to undermine our basic values and ide with our allies, Coats said. They are the ones who are trying to wreak havoc over our election process.As with other Trump administration officials attending Aspen, Coats was asked whether he ever considered resigning from what has been a volatile Trump presidency.US president Donald Trump visits UK, in picturesCoats didn\u0027t answer the question directly. He said when he has frustrating days, he reminds himself about why he agreed to accept the job and what he hoped to accomplish.As long as I\u0027m able to have the ability to seek the truth and speak the truth, I\u0027m on board, Coats said.Trump has had a tense relationship with US intelligence agencies since before he was elected - largely because of their conclusion that Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at helping the Trump campaign and harming his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton.Earlier in the administration, Coats\u0027 voice was drowned out by the more outspoken Mike Pompeo, who was CIA director before Trump tapped him as secretary of state. Now with Pompeo heading the State Department, Coats has been thrust into the limelight as the voice of the intelligence community.On other issues, Coats said only time will tell if North Korea will be willing to give up its nuclear weapons program.Coats said US intelligence on North Korea was significantly better than it used to be, but that the US should not assume it will happen and that trust and verify should be America\u0027s mantra.Inside Theresa May and Donald Trump\u0026#039s not-so-special relationshipNational Security Adviser John Bolton has suggested that North Korea could denuclearize in a year. Coats said Thursday it\u0027s technically possible but that it probably won\u0027t happen.Coats noted that Pompeo has projected a longer time frame.He also said that North Korean exports have declined dramatically, putting economic pressure on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. He says with that pressure on him, why shouldn\u0027t the US go forward and see what happens.Coats was asked if there is a risk that nerve agent poisonings in Britain that have been blamed on the Russians are possible in the United States. It\u0027s a risk, Coats said of the poisonings, which Russia has denied. The Russians do bold things, extraordinary things. ... If you think the Russians are trying to be a good neighbor - these are the things they still do.On China, Coats said that the US has to decide if China is a true adversary or a legitimate competitor.Either way, he said the US must stand strong against China\u0027s effort to steal business secrets and academic research. I think that\u0027s where we begin to draw the line, he said.Please review our commenting policyKnife attack on German bus: At least 14 wounded in stabbing in city of LuebeckComment: Should we defend little Montenegro?

Everything the expert finds out will be released to gardeners online, for free. Limited water supply during the heatwave has meant plants have struggled to retain water, and the hot weather has meant the lifecycle of garden pests has sped up.Sweet peas are at risk from hot weatherThis means they become more of a problem for gardeners tending already dry vegetable patches. Periods without rain can also impact negatively on soil and result in soil erosion, which is bad for plants in the long term.Traditional British plants under threat from increasingly hot summers include sweet peas, which have a weak root system that goes fragile and grey without enough water. Gardeners are currently finding their sweet peas only have one flower on each stem instead of three.Other flowers which will suffer include dahlias, which require a good watering to flower, and delphiniums, which can be impacted by mildew which is exacerbated by drought.In vegetable patches across Britain, onion crops will  be light and the bulbs very small meaning they are very hard to peel and not much use, and garden peas won’t set pod if they’re dry, and leafy greens such as spinach and lettuce suffer without moisture. The chief horticulturalist at the RHS, Guy Barter, told The : “Plants use energy to extract water from the soil, and the drier the soil the more energy used, which slows the growth of the plant until it can barely extract anymore water. The plant then closes down, goes dormant or sheds its leaves and possibly perishes.  However it is not just about hurling water willy-nilly on the garden. This would be expensive in water and irrigation equipment and not good environmental practice.  “Happily, science comes to the aid of gardeners because the water status of both plants and soil can be measured and irrigation protocols developed to get what the grower needs from the plant, whether foliage, flowers or edible produce, with the most efficient use of water, time and work. This is well worked out for commercial crops such as sugar beet, potatoes and apples but applying this on a garden scale requires more work.  For garden plants, being of little commercial importance, we are still in the irrigation dark ages so to speak, and there is enormous scope to produce scientific guidance in watering for gardeners.”Landscape designer and  columnist Jack Wallington added: The long, dry heatwave we’ve been facing since spring has had a noticeable impact on many edible plants. Peas, beans, rhubarb and lettuce being the worst affected food crops on my allotment, all lovers of moist soils and cooler temperatures. Outdoor tomatoes and aubergines should enjoy the hot summer with enough watering but even those have struggled a little on extremely hot days with leaf scorch. Newly planted dwarf fruit trees too have suffered in their first season before having a chance to establish good root systems. Ferns at home have really had a tough time of it with fronds crisping up despite extra watering. However, some plants are thriving in the extra heat. Herbs in particular will positively revel in the Mediterranean summer conditions, many having originated from this region. Fennel, basil, rosemary and sage are all growing like rockets.

In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Some even suggested that it should not be opened, for fear that it could unleash a hideous curse.It was found next to a giant alabaster head that served only to deepen the mystery of what was inside.Black sarcophagus found in Egypt is finally openedEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesEgyptian Ministry of AntiquitiesNow archaeologists\u0026nbsphave prised open the eldritch box to find it was filled with dirty\u0026nbspwater and three skeletons, according to Egypt\u0027s Ministry of Antiquities.The water probably found its way into the box from a sewage trench, the ministry said. It may have caused the mummies to decompose and leave only their skeletons.The bodies are probably those of warriors. One of the them appears to have a wound that is the result of being hit by an arrow, experts said.Local reports suggested that officials from the Ministry of Antiquities mocked suggestions that the sarcophagus could unleash evil forces\u0026nbspor curses when\u0026nbspopened.In fact, it appeared to contain little of any note. There were no inscriptions or objects inside the coffin that would suggest the bodies belonged to members of an ancient royal family, for instance.Some had hoped that the tomb could contain the body of Alexander The Great, which would help solve one of antiquity\u0027s greatest mysteries. But there is nothing to suggest that any of the skeletons belong to that famed warrior and empire builder.Alexander\u0027s body has never been found. He asked for his corpse to be thrown into the\u0026nbspEuphrates river – but speculation has been rife ever since that his body was actually disposed of in a tomb, and that it is still lying waiting to be found.Either way it is incredibly rare to find an unopened sarcophagus in Alexandria. Anyone planning to build in the city must first have archaeologists inspect the site, and while they occasionally find\u0026nbspsarcophagi they have usually been looted.The skeletons will now be removed from the site and sent to the National Museum of Alexandria, the ministry said. The sarcophagus will also be removed from the site once it is checked over and repaired.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He also cited border checks, unfair competition and potential fraud as other possible problems.Mr Barnier was speaking after meeting with ministers from the EU\u0027s 27 other member states.Earlier, Theresa May used a\u0026nbspspeech in Northern Ireland\u0026nbspto call on the EU to accept the UK\u0027s Brexit proposals.Visiting the region for the first time since taking office, the prime minister sought to reassure residents and businesses\u0026nbspthat she is committed to maintaining a soft border with the Republic of Ireland.\u0026nbspShe insisted that her government\u0027s Brexit plan works for the whole UK, including Northern Ireland and said it is now for the EU to respond.See below for live updates\u0026nbspMr Barnier told reporters he had raised a number of questions about the proposals in the white paper, including plans for the common rulebook.So, how can we protect consumers in Europe? he said.Mr Barnier questioned whether the white paper was workable without additional bureaucracy and also raised concerns about the collection of tariffs.He said: Are the British proposals in the interests of the EU?The negotiating chief raised concerns about how the EU would avoid unfair competition from Britain if it agrees to the plan for ergence on services.He added: Our main aim is to protect the EU\u0027s single market, to protect what we are, he said.Barnier highlighted several proposals in May\u0027s white paper which he said would open the way for constructive discussions, including:- The proposal for a free trade agreement which will be at the very heart of our future economic relations- A commitment to a level playing field, especially as regards state aid and the rules on employment and the environment- A broad convergence on the absolute need to co-operate on both internal and external security- The guarantees that are going to be provided for defending fundamental rights and the recognition of the role to be played by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as sole arbiter.Brexit cannot and will not justify additional bureaucracy, he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe also asks whether the British proposals are in the interests of the EU... he says the withdrawal agreement is the pre-requisite for the transitional agreement.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspHe says the member states are committed to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its elements.\u0026nbspThe press conference has now started - the Austrian federal minister says the negotiations need to be accelerated. He says the Irish border is a key issue and without a solution we have no deal or transition period.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBarnier\u0027s press conference has been pushed back around 25 mins - so we should now be expecting him on stage around 12.30Michael Roth, German foreign minister, has spoken to reporters on arrival\u0026nbspat a meeting of member states in Brussels.\u0026nbspEurope correspondent Jon Stone has sent these quotes.On whether the UK Chequers proposal is successful:“That’s the one million euro question and we will discuss this issue today with our colleagues and with our chief negotiator Barnier. For us, it’s extremely crucial that the EU27 stands united.”“I will remain an optimist, but it’s hard to be an optimist in these challenging times.“We are committed to stand united as EU27 and it’s my job as the German minister for Europe to support this unity. It’s challenging, it’s not easy, but I’m very proud to see there is a clear message to our British friends. There’s just one joint and common response to the so-called white paper of the British government.”On British political instability“We are extremely aware of the current situation.

They’ve hired almost a thousand customs officials just in case Britain crashes out.“We’re a trading nation we cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exports of goods and services. We also hired veterinary officials because if you crash out, you also have that problem.”Dutch port officials told The Independent this year the Netherlands’\u0026nbspcustoms authorities were aiming to hire between 750 and 930 officials – suggesting the number actually hired is right at the upper end of that early estimate as talks look increasingly likely to fail.On Friday, ministers from the remaining 27 EU states are expected to be presented with a dossier drawn up by the European Commission laying out how to plan for a “no deal” Brexit.\u0026nbspWe cannot afford our customs system to completely get stuck because from one day to the next we also have to check all the British exportsThe Netherlands has been amongst the best prepared EU member states regarding Brexit, with ports like Rotterdam and hub airports like Schipol planning significant physical changes to accommodate the extra checks likely to slow down trade following Britain’s departure.Preparations in the UK are behind schedule for a “no deal” scenario, with huge overflow lorry parks needed to accommodate freight in Kent not expected to be completed in time if Britain does crash out.Mr Omtzigt was scathing at the UK’s lack of preparations for its Brexit talks and the timing of the white paper outlining the nation’s Brexit ambitions: “I share concerns that it’s a bit late in the day, that one year and four months after tabling the Article 50 notification, the UK makes a proposal.“I think it’s a proposal that’s a good starting point for negotiations – but it’s a proposal to start negotiations. It would have been helpful that that had been on the table the day the negotiations started.”Ms May\u0026nbsphas repeatedly said “no deal is better than a bad deal” and threatened to lead the UK off an economic cliff edge if she does not get her way in talks with the EU.Asked whether the UK was hiring more customs officers, cabinet office minister David Lidington\u0026nbspsaid: “I think that all governments, including the United Kingdom government, have to plan for all contingencies.”Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

The policy risks being a dangerous distraction from the pressing issues our democracy faces – from our outdated campaign regulations to a broken voting system.In its independent evaluation, the Electoral Commission said it found “little evidence” of a negative impact on voters, “with few deterred by the need to show identification”.It added: “Overall, the voter identification requirements trialled in May 2018 worked well.“Nearly everyone in the five pilot scheme areas who went to vote in their polling station was able to show identification without difficulty. The number of people who did not vote because they couldn’t show identification was very small.”Craig Westwood, the Electoral Commission’s director of communications and research, said: “From the experience of voters, to the staff delivering the pilots, the overall picture from these pilots is a positive one.“The next step should be to test the requirement for voter identification in areas with different demographics.“It will be important to develop the evidence base about the impact of voter identification on different groups of people. No eligible elector should be prevented from voting because of voter identification requirements.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It saw its 240-strong workforce, in 16 offices across the country, retain full pay alongside a three-day weekend.\u0026nbspAndrew Barnes, chief executive of Perpetual , said he had made a recommendation to the board to continue the policy after an analysis revealed a “massive increase” in staff satisfaction with no drop in productivity.\u0026nbspNew Zealand firm trials four day working week for five days\u0027 wagesThe four-day week could transform our lives and our economy Schools consider four-day week in cost cutting driveThe research, Mr Barnes said, was conducted by two independent academics drafted to ensure an objective analysis of the impact on the company and workforce. \u0026nbsp“What we\u0027ve seen is a massive increase in engagement and staff satisfaction about the work they do, a massive increase in staff intention to continue to work with the company and we\u0027ve seen no drop in productivity, Mr Barnes told the New Zealand Herald.\u0026nbspDespite fears a day less at work would lead to a fall in staff productivity, Mr Barnes said there had been no sign of a drop off.\u0026nbspOur leadership team reported that there was broadly no change in company outputs pre and during the trial,” he said. “They perceived no reduction in job performance and the survey data showed a marginal increase across most teams.He now needs permission to continue the scheme by the board, which is expected to make its decision in the next few weeks.\u0026nbspThe move could potentially have ramifications for the wider New Zealand workforce. While the average New Zealander\u0026nbspworked 1,752 hours over the course of 2016 – which makes them close to the norm when compared with their OECD peers – the amount they work is significantly ahead of the 1,363 hours put in by Germans.Research has shown working fewer hours can result in you being more productive. Although Germany has the shortest working hours among OECD member countries, it manages to achieve among the highest productivity levels.Stats show a German worker to be 27 per cent more productive than their British counterpart who works 1,676 hours a year.World news in picturesArab lawmakers stand up in protest during a Knesset session in Jerusalem.

Only the ruling\u0026nbspUnited Russia fraction voted for, with all of the controlled “opposition” parties voting against.\u0026nbspSeveral deputies in the ruling party, hitherto known for demonstrative displays of loyalty, were mysteriously absent from the vote.\u0026nbspThe main provisions of the reform see the pension age increase from 60 for men and 55 for women, to 65 and 63 respectively. Its sponsors say the changes are necessary to bring the law into line with new life expectancy figures. Pension ages were last set in 1936, when pensioners accounted for no more than 2 per cent of the population. \u0026nbsp“Life has changed,”\u0026nbspthe employment\u0026nbspminister\u0026nbspMaxim\u0026nbspTopilin\u0026nbsptold parliamentarians. “We can’t remain in the 1930s.”\u0026nbspThe contentious issue of pension reform has been raised several times in the last two decades, but the government has repeatedly chosen to delay. It presented the bill in\u0026nbspless than auspicious economic times. Most Russians have faced real-terms wage falls since 2014, and the outlook is grim.\u0026nbspMr Putin’s trust ratings have\u0026nbspfallen to the lowest recorded ebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters.Critics have also railed against the way the pensions plan was communicated, announced with no discussion a few hours before kick off during the opening match of the World Cup, between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia. Fnance\u0026nbspminister Anton Siluanov has insisted that this was a coincidence, but the public outcry was real.\u0026nbsp“It is a bastardly way to introduce reform,” said the former Kremlin adviser Gleb Pavlovsky in an interview on the Echo of Moscow radio station. “The people have a deal with the Kremlin in return for not protesting – and the most important part of that deal is that they are given the chance to survive.”\u0026nbspIn some regions\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspproposed pension ages fall below average life expectancy\u0026nbsp– in Chukotka,\u0026nbspin the country’s far east, the male life expectancy is 60.33, nearly five years below the proposed pension age.\u0026nbspFor many families\u0026nbspthe change will represent a fundamental shift to their way of life. Even according to state pollsters, eight out of\u0026nbsp10 Russians do not agree with the plans. There have already been\u0026nbspprotests against the reform.\u0026nbspOn the eve of the bill, 14 people were arrested at an unsanctioned rally in St Petersburg.\u0026nbspRegardless of whether significant protests follow, the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever,\u0026nbspsays the political analyst Ekaterina Schulmann\u0026nbsp“It is a tectonic shift. Even before the pension reform, people were viewing the state as less and less of a father figure. But the reform strengthens that perception.”In Ms Schulmann\u0027s view, these changes will affect the transfer of power between Vladimir Putin and his anointed successor, a process which may begin as early as 2021.\u0026nbspThe paw of Mr Putin has remained strangely hidden throughout the process. His press secretary,\u0026nbspDmitry Peskov, has distanced the president from the unpopular bill.\u0026nbspReports, on the other\u0026nbsphand, suggested the president approved the plan before its first reading. And all the while, state media have been kept under strict control. They have been told to avoid the word “reform”, to avoid associations with the “chaotic” 1990s, but nonetheless to keep close to a line emphasising the necessity of reform.\u0026nbspThere may not be protests, but the relationship between the people and the state has changed forever\u0026nbspBut the attempt to differentiate a\u0026nbspgood tsar from bad\u0026nbspboyars might not have been altogether successful.On the back of the controversy, trust\u0026nbspin Mr Putin has fallen to\u0026nbspthe lowest recorded\u0026nbspebb since 2011 – below 38 percent, according to state pollsters. And perhaps more significantly, the president’s ratings are falling steadily\u0026nbspin line with government popularity. This is the first time this has happened since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.\u0026nbspSome now wonder if the president is in danger of losing his Teflon coating.\u0026nbspIt may, of course, have been another coincidence, but on the eve and the day of the vote\u0026nbspthe Russian military released several videos purporting to show the testing of new cutting-edge “Avangard” and “Kinzhal” missiles. Russians are generally supportive of the president’s assertive foreign policy stance – as opposed to domestic policies with which they interact with every day.Propaganda directors may have decided to use the opportunity to play down\u0026nbspreaction to the proposal.\u0026nbspWelcome to the real Russia, on eve of electionRussia\u0027s imperial capital is the starting point of our journey Chudovo was one of the first stops of Radishchev\u0027s journeyThey say the fish rot from the head down429 On the way out of ChudovoWe choose our president, we choose our futurePeople have become fussy and want clear waterLife is just great Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Once the seat of a forward-looking republic — Russia\u0027s first experiment with democracy Navalny\u0027s activists continue campaign despite their leader being barred from the elections Thatcher was a bitch, but I liked her.

But the government had little choice but to press ahead – which it will now do.\u0026nbsp“Some concessions in timings and in exceptions may be possible, but the reform is inevitable,” Mr Kostin\u0026nbsptold The Independent.\u0026nbsp“You can’t ignore a situation where there will soon be one pensioner for every working age adult.

But this surely depends upon what the other possibilities are. This deserves the serious analysis that Mrs May and her team have apparently not given it.There are broadly two options. The first is to accept one of the off-the-shelf arrangements. The one that most closely accords with achieving a full Brexit, corresponding to what people voted for two years ago, is the recently agreed EU deal with Canada.This is not ideal for us, but it is pretty good. It might be possible to add some bells and whistles that extend the scope of the agreement, particularly with regard to services. This is what is known as “Canada plus”.With or without the plus, this would give us tariff and barrier-free trade between the EU and the UK while ending free movement of people, the payment of substantial sums to Brussels each year and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, while enabling us to sign FTAs with whoever we wanted to.Interestingly, the EU offered us the Canada deal earlier this year but this was turned down by the Prime Minister, supposedly because it wasn’t ambitious enough and because it would not provide a solution to the supposed “problems” concerning the Irish border.Since then, Mrs May’s ambitions have decayed to the delivery of abject surrender while not saying so.As to the Irish border, it has been clear for some time that these “problems” have been manufactured by the Remain-leaning establishment precisely as a way of blocking a full Brexit.There is no need for a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. It is perfectly possible for goods to move freely across the border, relying on pre-registration and subsequent random checks.There is already a soft border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland with regard to currencies, duties and tax rates. This would continue.Of course, it is possible that the EU will not now agree to something like the Canada deal. And the clock is ticking.In that case, there is another perfectly viable option, namely “no deal”. After all, as Mrs May used to say, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.In fact, this “no deal” expression is potentially misleading. It doesn’t mean that we couldn’t or shouldn’t have a deal on anything with the EU, including landing rights for planes, participation in various joint bodies, etc.What it means is simply that we would leave the EU without an agreement on trade, and operate under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules.The WTO option is widely misunderstood. It should hold no terrors for us. We currently do the bulk of our trade with non-EU countries under WTO rules. And if we left the EU without a deal we would not have to hand over the £39billion “divorce settlement”.Moreover, the WTO option leaves substantial areas of policy choice, including over what our tariffs are. We could decide to drop tariffs on particular goods but not others for instance, on cars, which currently incur tariffs at ten per cent, and/or on car components, where the rate is five per cent.Or we could decide, unilaterally, to drop all our tariffs to zero.We could start to negotiate FTAs immediately. Just because we fail to secure a trade deal with the EU before next March does not mean we can never secure such a deal.Indeed, we could put the EU “at the front of the queue” for trade deals. We would be able to conduct negotiations without the pressures emanating from the ticking clock imposed, arbitrarily and ridiculously, under the Lisbon Treaty.Of course, trading under WTO rules would still leave the much-dreaded “trade frictions” and possible delays at the border as we lose the supposedly huge advantages of Single Market membership. But these frictions have been massively overblown by the UK establishment. WTO rules oblige members (including the EU) to facilitate frictionless trade.John Mills, the Eurosceptic economist and Labour donor, has come up with estimates of border costs that are a fraction of the official ones.His view is especially worth noting because, unlike the civil servants behind the official view, he runs his own very successful business importing large amounts of consumer goods. I know whose estimates I believe.Some critics will say that this is all very well for finished goods, but not for the businesses that operate complex supply chains. To listen to them you would think that these only operate within the EU.In fact there are complex supply chains operating across the world. They seem to manage without common currencies, single markets and all the other paraphernalia so beloved by the EU.Meanwhile, umpteen countries around the world sell huge amounts into the EU without being members of the Single Market. How do they manage to overcome those pesky barriers, I wonder?Whatever difficulties may occur in the immediate aftermath of a full Brexit, this does not represent the final destination. Only when FTAs are in place with a broad swathe of countries, including the US, will we be able to see the full impact.The argument that we must accept the Chequers fudge just does not add up.

It is merely what happens when negotiated ineptly, by Remainers.They further argue we should choose between no-deal, Mrs May’s proposal or staying in. Why? The first vote determined we were leaving. The only reasonable choice would be deal or no deal.But we must not let it happen. Politics is in a dire enough state. The Tories are in meltdown trying to secure Brexit while fending off Corbyn’s Marxists and the nightmarish ruin they would unleash.Overturning the 2016 referendum result before it had even been carried out would collapse all faith in democracy itself.THERE’S no way of sugar-coating it — police just can’t be bothered investigating burglaries, along with much else.We’ve heard all the excuses: they’re hard to solve, we’re too short-staffed, “Tory cuts” and so on.But victim ­Izabela Siergiej gave them the criminal’s name, address and mugshot.

It would have kept us shackled to Brussels’ rules for all time, with no say over any of them.All the ambition for our great country as a newly independent global trader would have been swept away. We would have all the possible short-term pain of leaving, with no long-term gain.Theresa May’s Chequers plan is a feeble Brexit, but at least it’s freedom of a sort. That cannot be said of a customs union.It was repugnant to watch Westminster’s Remainer elite line up to argue for tying us to the EU, and pretend the Leave verdict didn’t mean actually leaving.Many seemed to treat it like a game, oblivious to the terrible danger they would have unleashed had they won.For once, and however briefly, the Government has something to celebrate.OF all the attempts to thwart Brexit, the campaign to pretend the referendum wasn’t fair is the most pathetic and dishonest.The Electoral Commission’s probe into Vote Leave’s alleged overspending is fatally flawed if it failed even to interview those who ran it.Worse, it has not applied the same scrutiny to the Remain camp, which clearly co-ordinated smaller groups just as Vote Leave is said to have done.As for Remainers claiming this alleged overspend skewed a tight referendum, what cobblers. The Commission’s own figures show Remain vastly outspent Leave — on top of the £9million David Cameron wasted leafleting every home begging us to vote to stay in.The odds were massively stacked against Leave and they still won.This Remain rearguard action has nothing to do with the vote’s legitimacy.It is just a continuing tantrum, aimed at the 17.4million who disagreed with them.IMAGINE the outrage if a newspaper hosted online videos of kids being abused.Facebook does, and refuses to remove them. It just marks them “disturbing” and limits them to users claiming to be over 18. Virtually everyone, in other words.A moderator, sickeningly, tells an undercover reporter: “If you start censoring too much, people lose interest in the platform. It’s all about making money.”Since Facebook apparently now considers itself a publisher it must be treated as such.

Blow after blow rains down on her authority. She is battered and bruised by her own party yet refuses to realise her time is up.The past few days have brought yet more resignations. Following the Foreign Secretary and the Brexit Secretary are ministers whose names escape me let’s call them Cuthbert, Dibble and Grubb.Though hardly well known, these MPs have grandly flounced off in protest at May’s handling of Brexit.In a particularly odd development, one is leaving the Government because he thinks the Government is not sticking to the spirit of government policy.All this on top of last week’s embarrassment, courtesy of Donald Trump. The President might have softened his comments about the Prime Minister and the “turmoil” afflicting the UK but the damage to May’s authority was done.God knows how this looks to the rest of the world. We used to bestride the international stage like a colossus now we stumble across it like Frank Spencer.The Prime Minister can’t take all the blame. She has been dealt a difficult hand — her party and the country split on Brexit, Europe turning the thumbscrews and Ukip waiting in the wings to hoover up Tory votes. It would be hard for any politician to make an outright success of this.But where Theresa May HAS failed categorically is on communicating her plans to the British people.The Chequers deal should have been a big moment. She should have been all over the TV stations selling this deal hard.In the past, prime ministers held public broadcasts to explain important matters to the people. Anthony Eden gave one on the Suez crisis, Harold Wilson on the devaluation of the Pound. Ted Heath warned in 1973 that the nation faced “the hardest Christmas that we have known since the war”.These leaders looked the nation in the eye, spoke directly to the British people — and LED.Theresa May, on the other hand, seems reluctant to get out and make the case for her own policy.Little wonder that two thirds of the public questioned on the Chequers deal were baffled by it. Confusion reigns.This points to a major problem with May’s premiership. She is hopeless at telling a national story.It’s the job of a leader not just to make decisions but to inspire the nation. For the person in No10, their words speak as loudly as their actions. They need to tell a compelling story about where Britain is going.Margaret Thatcher told the story of Britain emerging from the ashes of socialism thanks to the hard work and enterprise of its people: “A get-up-and-go instead of a sit-back-and-wait-for- it Britain.”Tony Blair told the story of Britain shrugging off the past and embracing the modern world: “A new Britain . . . a model 21st-century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all.”David Cameron told the story of Britain clearing up the economic mess left by Labour, paying down our debts and living within our means.Love or loathe these leaders, at least they told a clear story about where Britain was going. We get none of this from May.She makes a virtue of just “getting on with the job”. But in a nation divided on Brexit, we desperately need more. We need a clear sense of direction for Britain’s future.Of course, the Prime Minister cannot last for much longer. In boxing terms she’s in the 12th round. Before long there will be a leadership contest — and those hoping to succeed May must learn from where she went wrong.The next resident of No10 must not only have the right policies but the right vision.If Britain is to regain its reputation abroad, and its self-respect at home, we urgently need a Prime Minister who inspires, who tells a national story — and who truly leads.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sadly, a year or so later they also voted to keep the appalling Anna Soubry as their local MP. Let’s hope they never make that mistake again.For the last year this bilious, jabbering woman has done everything she possibly can to thwart the will of her electors.She is a staunch Remainer and is seemingly prepared to bring down the Government to get her way. Her actions suggest she couldn’t give a monkey’s about what the people in her constituency think.Two nights ago she was one of 12 Conservative rebels who voted against the Government. She wanted Britain to remain part of a customs union with the EU. That would mean — effectively — no real Brexit. And if they had won, it would have been catastrophe for the Government. And in my opinion, the country.The reason they didn’t lose is solely down to a bunch of courageous Labour MPs, including the excellent Frank Field, who voted with the Government. Soubry isn’t alone, of course. The people of Loughborough, Leics, also voted by a large margin to leave the EU.But they are represented in the House of Commons by Nicky Morgan, who appears not to give a toss what they think. She also voted for a customs union. Nicky is famous among many for being the second worst Education Secretary this country has ever had. She’s pipped to the post for that particular prize by Justine Greening.Being useless in their Cabinet posts isn’t the only thing that unites these two women. Greening is also opposed to Brexit and she has even called for a second referendum. Because she didn’t like the result of the first one.The people of Beaconsfield, Bucks, voted to leave the EU. But their MP, the grim Dominic Grieve, who resembles a funeral director from about 1923, appears not to care less. He has said he’s prepared to “collapse” the Government if he does not get his way.Sarah Wollaston is another one. Another embittered MP. Her constituency, Totnes in Devon, voted to leave by a sizeable margin.Because while it is true that the majority of Labour MPs are also opposed to Brexit, they have been nothing like as dangerous as the Tory rebels.We are in a mess. The Prime Minister staggers from crisis to crisis, striking meaningless deals whenever she can to stave off defeat for a few more days.She surely cannot last much longer. A Remainer herself, of course, I think she should be persuaded to call it a day. Go home, put her feet up. And let her party elect a leader who will take no more c**p from Brussels.And no more c**p from the likes of Soubry and Greening, either.THE top scientist Richard Dawkins – Britain’s most famous atheist – has got himself into trouble.He has said that he prefers to hear the sound of cathedral bells to the muezzin wail calling Muslims to prayer.  Saying something as inoffensive as that is enough to get you into hot water these days.Dawkins has been called a bigot as a consequence. I have to say I disagree with him. I love the sound of cathedral bells, sure.But I also enjoying hearing the Muslim call to prayer – when I’ve been on my travels in Morocco or Malaysia. But, over here, it’s cathedral bells for me every time.Here’s a tip, then.Take them to an expensive shoe shop and make them look at the display through the window.And remember the noise they make.KATIE PRICE is on holiday in Thailand and of course she’s got her baps out.  This might be a problem for Katie, pictured with boyfriend Kris Boyson.Topless sunbathing is against the law over there.

And as a break from lying on the beach, how do you fancy a spot of caving?YOU’VE got to love the toffs, haven’t you?  Most of them are absolutely crazy after years of inbreeding.Take the brilliant Lizzie Purbrick who described herself as “a very well-bred toff”.  She went round to her married lover’s home after he’d cheated on her with a third woman.No messing with Lizzie. She took with her eight litres of pig’s blood which she sprayed across his flat. She daubed the words “slut” and “whore” and “big d**k lord” on his walls and sprayed a giant penis on the floor.  She said: “So many people have said I should write my life story, but I’m so bonkers I can’t remember it.”The judge said – in one of the great under-statements of the decade – that she had “real concerns about the defendant’s ability to make rational decisions”.No s**t, Sherlock.It started out a few years back with just a couple of stalls. Now the entire town centre is closed off and thousands turn up to pig themselves on cuisine from scores of nationalities.I got so stuffed last year I needed to be helped home. And not a chicken parmo – the supposed Teesside dish of choice – in sight.IT’S not often that the Labour peer Dame Margaret Hodge says something worth repeating. But in telling her party leader Jeremy Corbyn that he was a “f***ing anti-Semite and a racist” I think she kinda hit the nail on the head.Meanwhile, the decent, moderate Labour MP John Woodcock has resigned the party whip and become an independent.Long-time party members – like I was, until last year – know that Labour is currently led by a hard-left anti-Jewish rabble of thickoes.I hope the voters twig this sooner or later.AND now it’s time for Hypocrites of the Week. A special award for Pimlico Plumbers of London.They’ve put up a giant banner outside their premises about Brexit, saying: “Nobody voted to be poorer!”Pimlico Plumbers has just lost a landmark case brought by one of its employees.

Although so it should, seeing as it has been years in the making.But there is one big difference to the original I know and love. The texture is much thicker.The traditional bar is so smooth, it almost instantly melts on your tongue and slides down your throat without needing to swallow. This reduced-sugar offering doesn’t.This one melts and then oozes over your tongue, giving it a heavy chocolatey coating that stays put until you swallow.Even after swallowing there is a little bit of sticky remnant left on my tongue.It’s this tiny bit of clagginess in the texture that tells me this bar hasn’t quite managed the perfect imitation of the fully-sugared original.But to be honest - if you are not as obsessed with chocolate as I am, you probably won’t notice the difference.’This way they can use less sugar but keep the texture – which experts pinpoint as a key feature of chocolate – the same.This is a different method to the one used Nestle which has lead the way in sugar reduction. They have altered the structure of sugar molecules to contain air which means they can use less of the product but the tongue senses the same level of sweetness.In early 2017, Nestle began launching lower sugar versions of treats, starting with KitKat and then Aero and Smarties.Sugar in chocolate varies but milk chocolate is typically around 50 per cent, white around 60 per cent and dark below 40 per cent and as low as zero.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said: “The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the single European sky.“If they leave the EU they are not, and that does mean if there was a no-deal hard Brexit next March, the planes would not fly and Britain would be an island in many ways. If they want their planes to fly over our skies, they would need to take that into account.”The Ireland boss insisted: “You can’t have your cake and eat it. You can’t take back your waters and then expect to take back other people’s sky”.A DExEU spokesman said: “We do not want or expect a no deal scenario. Our White Paper sets out both our desire to agree a mechanism for annual negotiations on access to waters and fishing opportunities, as well as reciprocal liberalised aviation access with the EU through an Air Transport Agreement.”But a senior UK government source branded the comments “mad”.British officials pointed out that freedoms of the air are not guaranteed by the EU, but a multilateral international treaty – the International Air Services Transit Agreement - signed from 1944 onwards, by 133 countries.The only way Ireland can block British planes flying over it would be to pull out of the treaty, which it has been a signatory to since 1957. Others said Britain could retaliate by blocking Irish planes from flying to mainland Europe over the UK, doubling the length of their journies.The Director of the Open Europe think tank Henry Newman said Mr Varadkar is “in danger of losing the plot”.Alex Macheras, Aviation Analyst, said “It’s a ridiculous statement and the reason why ICAO’s International Air Services Transit Agreement exists - of which Ireland are signatory - which ensures countries cannot simply ‘impose a ban’ on their airspace, and the treaty specifically states that countries are forbidden from discriminating against the nationality of an aircraft.IRISH Prime Minister Leo Varadkar is a bigmouth and a fool, but his latest bone-headed outburst has done us all a favour.It has exposed beyond doubt both his crass naivety and the cynical deceit of the EU masters he cravenly obeys.Imagine the cataclysmic self-harm of Ireland preventing planes from its biggest trading partner flying over it. And the impossibility of its own airlines avoiding UK airspace. It won’t happen.Varadkar must believe that these grenades he brainlessly lobs into the Brexit negotiations help Brussels. He is not bright enough to realise how absurd and unstatesmanlike he looks.But he let something else very revealing slip too. Varadkar reportedly said that EU leaders have assured him no hard border or customs checks will ever be needed between Ireland and Northern Ireland. That’s under ANY scenario, including a No Deal.Since we will never build a hard border either, why is “avoiding” one still being discussed, let alone a huge sticking point?Answer: It is a ruse, confected by a Brussels desperate to keep us in its grip.“Ireland has very little airspace and if a ban were to take place Ireland would lose all flights operated to/from the country flown by aircraft with G- registrations, Great Britain. This is without mentioning that much of Ireland’s airspace management, and air traffic control, is actually based in the UK.”Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: Air traffic control continued between Russia and the Ukraine after Russia invaded the Crimea so this idea is just silly.On the other hand most flights from the EU to America pass through our air traffic control so this rather lightweight Irish gentleman is proposing an absurd act of a masochistic nature. His words are those of an airhead.Andrew Rossindell MP said: Who will this benefit? Mr Varadka needs to think very long and hard before he makes statements like this. Its incredibly damaging to British-Irish relations and very short-sighted. If he thinks this would benefit Ireland, he needs to think again. In reality it would just be catastrophic for everyone.If his ideological obsession with the EU means Ireland cant have sensible relations with its closest neighbour and friend, its a tragedy and totally outrageous. He should stop taking his orders from Brussels and start thinking about the greater good of the people of Ireland and the whole of the British Isles.Ireland will always be tied to Britain, no matter what happens, and if it harms us it will harm them. He needs to change his attitude very urgently.Last night RAF legend John Nichol said: “Regardless of your views on Brexit, the notion that you can have a one way system is farcical and non sensical. It’s a ludicrous notion you can have a ban on civilian aircraft coming to one area but when you desperately need the Brits’ help you change your mind.“That would be strange and incomprehensible. “You really cannot have it both ways. We have spent years building up warm relations with Ireland. They should not be a republic of Brussels and think of their own long-term national interest. The EU will use them and spit them out, but we are genuinely Irelands best friend.Mr Varadka is playing a very dangerous game politically in trying to prevent Brexit.In a second rumpus, Mr Varadkar was also accused of hypocrisy after he claimed the EU had promised him that no physical checks will need to be erected on the Irish border even if the UK crashes out with no deal.Under the “doomsday scenario”, the Taoiseach said the “commitments of others” would then kick in to prevent a hard border. But Brexiteers leaped on his declaration to insist that has been Britian’s argument all along.Tory MEP Dan Hannan said: “Ireland confirms it won’t put up physical border checks in any circumstances, including a no-deal scenario. The UK has said the same from the outset. So what the hell are we arguing about?”Critics also said Mr Varadkar’s declaration was in contravention of the World Trade Organisation’s rules, which insist on borders between different customs regime being policed. Mrs May visited the Irish border town of Belleek in Fermanagh last night to meet local businesses and hear their concerns.This morning, the PM will deliver a speech in Belfast to call on hard Brexiteers who have rejected her softer Brexit Chequers deal to start addressing the reality on the ground. And she will insist that is their “duty”, as the future of the UK is at stake if they don’t.Mrs May will say: “Our job is not to deal with Brexit in theory, but to make a success of it in practice for all of our people. For all of us who care about our country, for all of us who want this Union of nations to thrive, that duty goes to the heart of what it means to be a United Kingdom and what it means to be a government.”But former Brexit minister David Jones challenged the PM to claim the Irish border issue has been “weaponised” by the EU to get its way in the negotiations.A record 1.13m flights operated in Irish airspace last year, according to the Irish Aviation Authority - 2.5 per cent more than in 2016.During 2017 there was a five per cent increase in the number of flights operating between Europe and the United States which used Irish airspace.They accounted for almost 501,000 of the total number of commercial flights handled in Irish airspace during 2017.Dublin to London is the second-busiest route in world. Almost 4.5million people flew between the Irish and British capitals last year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Every week, there will be a detailed bundle of advice published for citizens, consumers and companies about what they need to do to prepare for March 29, 2019, when Britain will cease to be a member of the EU and be flicked, like an unwanted beer mat, off Beachy Head into the arms of all those international trade deals we don\u0027t have.  We can only hope a civil servant has had the sense to write \u0027DON\u0027T PANIC!\u0027 on the cover. Of course they won\u0027t be necessary if the EU gives in and does what Jacob Rees-Mogg wants. And if they don\u0027t, there\u0027s a strong chance they\u0027ll just extend the Article 50 deadline, which would be useful if the headbangers hadn\u0027t insisted on legislation that named March 29 as B-Day. So what will they say, these worst-case-scenario papers that have suddenly become, with eight months to go, the increasingly-likely-scenario plan?  Even the most cautious types could tell you it\u0027ll mean a \u0026pound5.50 driving permit at Dover, a shortage of cucumbers and longer queues at airports. But the full truth is, in a post-Brexpocalypse world, it\u0027ll involve a lot of currently-unforeseen consequences of having made the EU an offer it can very easily refuse.  Dark and unpleasant things like this: 1. Cliff Richard will lose his human rights   Which will be annoying, as he\u0027s just spent around \u0026pound4million trying to improve them for people accused of terrible things. If we Brexit without copying the EU\u0027s Charter of Fundamental Rights, we\u0027ll lose rules on data protection, human trafficking, disability rights, equal pay and workplace discrimination, as well as the rights of victims of crime.  We\u0027ll still have the European Court of Human Rights, which is not part of the EU, but it\u0027ll take a six-figure sum and several years to take any complaints to it, so unless you\u0027re as rich as Cliff the chances are the ECHR will be as much use as a unicorn\u0027s nosebag. The government says all current laws we have as a result of the EU will remain in UK law - however, there\u0027s nothing to stop any future Parliament repealing them in the name of, say, trade deals with tyrants. 2. All medicine will be 30-year-old cough syrup from the back of the medicine cabinet   Goodbye, radioactive isotopes used in MRI scanners. So long, EU-regulated cancer medication, clinical trials and any confidence you currently have that a packet of paracetamol from the garage definitely does not include Spice. Hello again to whatever you can find in an exploration of the furthest reaches of your bathroom storage. Need opioids because mum broke her arm? Tixylix. Need an appendix removed? Vicks Vapour Rub, if you can get the lid off. And in the case of childbirth, you can forget a nurse, midwife or doctor and place your faith instead in the pain-killing, life-saving properties of a dusty packet of Strepsils.  You can say Oh, lime cordial! Delicious! all you please, but it has already been announced that from March next year and in the absence of a deal the UK authorities will no longer be able to engage with the EU medicine regulator.  May I suggest you start stockpiling Germolene. You are going to need it. 3. Kent will fill up with lorries and empty of people   Perhaps you don\u0027t live in Kent and couldn\u0027t care less. But 1,554,600 people do, and when the most rebellious county in Britain (a regicide, two peasant revolts, a saint who told a king to bog off and the woman who sparked schism in the church, and you\u0027re welcome) realises it has become a lorry park for an entire national motorway network they will up sticks and cross the Medway in droves.  Still not bothered? Ask yourselves this. Would 1.5m brown people suddenly arriving on the mainland be able to find a home, job and schools, and does the fact the Kentish ones are a mix of brown, white, chavvy, privileged, light-fingered and small-minded really make much difference to the answer? They\u0027re not all Pop Larkin, you know. And Catherine Zeta Jones was Welsh. 4. The end of the rule of law   WAIT WHAT.  Sorry, but yes. It\u0027s already begun. Law in this country is built upon convention and precedent, and in the past two years the convention that the Prime Minister is in charge of things has been tossed out of the window while precedent has been offered up like a sacrificial chicken on the altar of The People Voted For A Thing There Is No Precedent For.   We are now in a situation where thousands march because a Far Right idiot who admitted breaking the law, and imperilled the course of justice for everyone, is in in jail for it. We live in a land where seagulls are murdered for chips, children leave the house tooled up and we are perhaps 5 minutes away from someone claiming that the freedom to commit sexual assault is a human right.  When this all goes tits up next year the chances are your home will become your castle. Check the locks, barricade the windows, figure out your escape routes. If you\u0027ve got a garden, dig a bunker, and if you\u0027re near water build an ark. Once financial passporting is no longer allowed, and the City collapses, the countryside will be filled with currency and commodity traders roaming wild in their pink trousers, gorging on the proletariat while Jacob Rees-Mogg shepherds them along in an armoured Bentley with a Remainer stuck in the grille.   And perhaps you think this is all so much Remoaner panic, except for two things. Firstly, the government is about to drip-feed you a weekly diet of very similar, if worded differently, predictions. And secondly there are reports that Vladimir Putin has given a Far Right paramilitary motorbike gang in Slovakia some of his tanks. The Night Wolves paramilitaries and their friends say these are merely decommissioned vehicles hired for a new museum. But these guys are said to admire Stalin and fought on the pro-Russian side in Ukraine, where the US says they attacked the country\u0027s navy HQ.  Ukraine, incidentally, is the same place where Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 was downed by a Russian missile in 2014, which Putin\u0027s militia claimed credit for until they realised it was not a military transport but a holiday flight with 298 civilians on board.  So that\u0027s pro-Russian paramilitaries with Russian military kit inside the EU borders, but it\u0027s just for a museum honest even though they have a history of it actually being for killing.  As we head down the Brexit plughole there may yet be a last-minute rescue by way of an extension, a general election, or a people\u0027s vote. But the portents are bad - Mogg is no longer funny and there are sharks everywhere.  There is however one bright, shining light on the horizon, and that is if civilised society collapses it will be acceptable and indeed vital for the nation\u0027s recovery for a crew of plucky survivors to pull together, hunt down Boris Johnson, shave his head and dip him repeatedly in the nearest rancid pile of uncollected domestic refuse while telling him they will stop just as soon as he produces a Brexit dividend.  Which is something to look forward to. Pity the electricity will have been off for months by that point and no-one will be able to livetweet it, but beggars can\u0027t be choosers. As we are all about to find out.

For the Queen, his presence has been one of steadfast support. For the public, he\u0027s almost as famous for his often off-colour gaffes as he is for a life of duty. Since retiring from public duties in August 2017 - and undergoing planned surgery - we\u0027ve obviously seen a lot less of the Duke of Edinburgh,  This, along with his age and health problems have, however, got people wondering what happens when Prince Philip passes away.      While Prince Philip very much remains alive and well, when that does happen, there are five things the British public can expect to take place. 1. How the news will break Should the Duke of Edinburgh die overnight, the official announcement is likely to be made at 8am, and the BBC will be the first to have the news confirmed. 2. No fancy funeral for him He may be entitled to a full-blown state funeral, but the Duke has expressed a preference for something a little more simple - and he\u0027s been closely involved with the arrangements, which are being co-ordinated by the Lord Chamberlain’s Office at Buckingham Palace.  Rather than lying in state at Westminster Abbey, it\u0027s thought the Duke\u0027s body will lie at St James’s Palace instead, where Princess Diana lay for several days before her funeral in 1997. The public would not be allowed to view the body. As for the funeral itself, it\u0027s believed the guest list will be comparatively paired back with only family, friends and heads of state from Commonwealth countries attending a service at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle, in the style of a military funeral.  3. Where he\u0027ll be buried While many of Britain\u0027s monarchs and consorts are buried in Westminster Abbey and St George\u0027s Chapel, Prince Philip\u0027s burial will be at a different, more private location. In keeping with his more low-key funeral the Duke of Edinburgh would be buried in Frogmore Gardens, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. That said, he\u0027ll be in good company - both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert are buried in a mausoleum there.  4. How long the mourning period lasts for If Prince Philip dies before the Queen, she is expected to enter a period of mourning which will last for eight days. During this time, laws will not be given the Royal Assent and affairs of state will be put on pause in a sign of respect.

Kayleigh, who lives with her parents in Stanley, Co Durham, said: “I wanted to take Harley to my prom and get her all dressed up to show her that she is a princess in my eyes – and always will be. “I hope she grows up knowing that she deserves the best and never to settle for anything or anyone that makes her unhappy. She should be treated with love and care. “I also wanted to show everyone else who thought I would never make it through school being a young mum that I did it. Here I am celebrating finishing school with my daughter. “I wanted everyone to see that Harley comes first. Nothing is just about me anymore, it’s about me and Harley. I wanted her to feel as beautiful and loved as I did on my prom day. Kayleigh kept her pregnancy secret for six months as she was terrified how her parents Sharon Snaith, 48, and Tommy Snaith, 53, would react. But the schoolgirl’s stunned mum and dad promised to support Kayleigh no matter what and set about frantically preparing their house for their new granddaughter Harley Snaith.  The young mum admitted it hasn’t been easy. She said: When Harley was a newborn I would be up through the night with her, sometimes for two or three hours if she didn’t settle, and then I would go to school. “At home I’m a mother and an adult to my child but then in school I was suddenly a student, a child there to learn. “I was so tired all the time and I would have people telling me I was disgusting, that I’d ruined my life, I’d never be a good mum and I’d never achieve anything in life. It was really hard. “But knowing Harley was at home waiting for me and that I was working for our future really motivated me. All the tiredness was worth it to build the best possible life for my daughter. Kayleigh said that getting through GCSEs was tough. She admitted she was terrified that she wouldn’t be able to do them while raising Harley.  “I remember sitting and crying because I was worried I would fail and I wouldn’t be able to get a job and do the best I could for Harley she told. It was a lot of pressure. “But Harley inspired me to keep going and gave me the big push I needed. I\u0027ve worked really hard and I’m looking forward to getting my results in August. “I hope by sharing the pictures from my prom, other young mums and their parents will realise that having a baby in your teens isn’t the end of the world. “No matter what people tell you or think of you, if you push yourself and work hard you can still achieve all of your life goals. “Yes, it is a struggle and it’s life changing but being a new mum always is. There are mums in their twenties and thirties who find it scary. Your age doesn’t define whether or not you’re a good mum. “You learn to ignore the comments. Harley is a beautiful, cheeky and happy little girl. She is a ray of sunshine and I’m proud to be her mum. I’ll never regret having her or be ashamed.”  When she skipped her period and started feeling movement in her stomach, Kayleigh knew she was pregnant but struggled to share the news with her family. After many sleepless nights scared about what a baby might mean for her future, Kayleigh spoke to her head of year who called in her mum. During her pregnancy, the mum-of-one attended school part time and returned full time just four weeks after Harley was born on May 6, 2016, weighing 6lbs 13oz. Kayleigh admits that raising a baby and finishing school has been difficult and says she couldn’t have done it without the incredible support and parenting tips from her mum and dad. While it has been tough, Kayleigh says Harley has made her a better and happier person and hopes sharing her experience will make society more accepting of young mums.  Kayleigh said: “As soon as I missed my period I suspected I was pregnant but I told myself that it happens to some girls. “When I started feeling movement in my stomach it was obvious what was going on but I was terrified of telling my mum and dad. “All these things go through your head. I was worried they would kick me out or make me get rid of her. I spent so many nights awake worrying about it, I couldn’t focus on anything else. “When I started to get a bit of a bump I knew I couldn’t keep it secret anymore so I asked my head of year to call in my mum. I couldn’t stop crying when I told her, I was so scared. “My mum was really shocked but I remember her saying ‘if you want to keep this child, we will support you and do everything we can for you’. “She even offered to adopt the baby but I wanted to raise her. My dad was a bit more upset, it took him longer to adjust. I’m his little girl and it was hard for him. “But they have both been amazing, they’re so supportive. They got everything ready for Harley’s arrival in three months. It was manic but we just about scraped through. “They’re always trying to better me as a parent and give me really great advice. I am so lucky, I couldn’t have got through all of this without them.

Jean Astley was presented with the realistic-looking birthday cake at her party on Saturday, as her granddaughter Haley Goulty, 40, filmed. Hilarious video footage shows Jean gazing in disbelief at her phallic surprise as daughter Liz Ferrar, 59, places it in front of her to the delight of her watching family. Liz urges her elderly mum to ‘come on, play with it’ - before squeezing double cream at her through a strategically placed pipe in the cake. As her family cheer, Jean squeals in shock as her hand is soaked in the surprise white liquid, before bursting into laughter.   Harrowing 999 call as girl, 15, watched stepdad pour petrol over home and threatened to burn sleeping family ALIVE  But the birthday girl got the willies and hilariously gave the cake a good shove away from herself - all while laughing her head off. Haley, from Leicester, said: “My nan wasn’t expecting it at all. You could see the shock in her face. “She may be 90 but she’s still young at heart. For a 90-year-old she’s got a very good sense of humour, and she swears like a trooper. “My mum had the cake made for her. I’ve no idea what inspired my mum to get that cake. “Everyone is used to my nan sitting in her arm chair, fag in one hand, remote in the other hand, and I think she really wanted to get her a cake like that but couldn’t get one. “But you can’t top that one now. She absolutely loved the cake. “When she was waiting for a cake she knew we had a surprise, and she just went ‘ooh is it a male stripper?’ “Me and my husband were joking a few months back about getting her one and she was saying ‘oh, maybe 10 years ago’. “We were going to have it sent to the house rather than the party, but I think that’s what she was expecting because we were covering her up in paper towels. “Nobody knew, only my mum and my brother, and it was all quiet and then they bought the cake out. It was brilliant.   Hero workmen save three-year-old boy who fell 40ft out of apartment window with amazing catch  “It’s lovely to see her like that because she doesn’t really get out much anymore.” The birthday party bought in five generations of family, with Jean’s 12 children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and even great-great grandchildren making up nearly 200 guests. But it wasn’t the first time that the family had managed to prank their matriarch with a raunchy gift. Haley said: “A few years ago my uncle bought her a vibrator and she thought it was a back massager. She didn’t use it. “We told her what it was and she just said: ‘put that thing away’. She has a great sense of humour in every aspect. “She’s very, very comical. We like to shock her if we can. “But she’s very quick off the mark. Say something and she can come back on you dead quick. “Honestly, people are really surprised when they meet her. “When someone new comes into the family we never tell them what my nan’s like so we can spring her on them.

The two duchesses were watching the Ladies\u0027 final from centre court in the royal box (where else?) and seemed to get on like a house on fire. But before Kate and Meghan there was Fergie and Diana - the original \u0027Merry Wives of Windsor\u0027.  Both young twenty-something women when they were hurled into royal life - and the limelight - the Duchess of York and the Princess of Wales had a clear rapport in the early years of their marriages.  They even holidayed together and were infamously pictured at Ascot poking Fergie\u0027s schoolfriend Lulu in the bottom with their umbrellas.  Fergie has frequently described Diana as her best friend and has often spoken of her devastation at her tragic death, made all the more painful as the two were not on speaking on terms at the time. The Duchess of York never got to reconcile with her friend. Their fall-out was touched on in Fergie\u0027s tell-all book, Finding Sarah.  Diana was one of the quickest wits I knew nobody made me laugh like she did, she wrote. We took vacations together with our children.

Members of the public watching Meghan\u0027s transformation from Hollywood actress into the Duchess of Sussex could be forgiven for thinking she\u0027d taken to her new role with ease. She made an effortless joint engagement with the Queen to open a new bridge, attended the RAF centenary flypast, was a guest of the Irish President alongside Harry, joined sister-in-law Kate Middleton at Wimbledon and looked stunning at Prince Louis\u0027 christening. But she is reportedly confused about aspects of royal life and the old-fashioned ways of the Windsor household. A source told People how Meghan has found certain rules in the royal household difficult to understand, like the fact that the Queen prefers women in dresses or skirts rather than trouser suits, and is often asking Harry why things have to be done in a certain way.    The source added: I think she finds it a little frustrating at times, but this is her new life, and she has to deal with it.” The monarchy website includes a reference to Meghan as a feminist.   She had never previously shied away from voicing her opinions on issues that were close to her heart. But protocol prohibits royal family members from expressing political opinions. There was no greater example of this than an Irish politician\u0027s recent blunder which revealed Meghan\u0027s opinions on the country\u0027s recent referendum on legalising abortion .  Senator Catherine Noone posted on Facebook : A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result. The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon. Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting.

Enough is enough. If our father dies, it\u0027s on you Meg.  Since Meghan, 36, and Prince Harry married in May, Samantha has blasted her sister and the couple\u0027s relationship on a number of occasions. She has accused Meghan of ignoring her own family while paying tribute to others. Samantha said: Glad you have so much time to gallivant around playing tribute to others while ignoring your own father. How cold can you be and look in the mirror. Harry? I guess I was right.

Student Jessica Lawson, 12, was swimming in a lake with friends in Massif Central when it\u0027s thought she came trapped under a pontoon in July 2015. Jessica, described as a cheery girl who was always smiling, died the next day. Her parents, Brenda and Antony, and sister Polly, then 19, were left “shattered into a million pieces”. They say the pain was worsened by a feeling of abandonment by UK and school authorities, who they claim have not given them any explanation about what happened, reports Hull Live . Struggling to survive this trauma so close to Jessica’s school has proved “too torturous” for Jessica’s parents, who are attempting to relocate to Portugal. Mrs Lawson, from Hull, says: “I fully appreciate life goes on. However, Jessica’s life does not go on.  “My family’s life has had to take a different path. A path we never ever expected to be on and under these circumstances. “Maybe I am naive to have thought UK authorities would come to our aid when we were helpless, traumatised and vulnerable. They didn’t and still haven’t. “Moving country doesn’t mean my pain goes away. As a dear friend of mine told me, it just makes it more bearable.” Mrs Lawson wants to know why children had been allowed to swim in the lake and without life jackets on. She says: “Swimming with her friends at Haltemprice Sports Centre on a Saturday afternoon is vastly different from being allowed to enter an open water lake.” The couple, who have set up a foundation in Jessica’s name with the main aim of offering assistance to other bereaved parents, insist their anguish is not over the length of the French investigation.  Mrs Lawson says: “My frustration is not with the French legal process, those investigating what happened and why are being very thorough. “The investigation takes time because of the cross border involvement. “The UK processes and protocols are also a minefield. “Delays happen when parties involved fail to meet deadlines or fail to respond. Many things can impact the investigation. “Sadly, the only people these delays affect are us the family, as we still have so many unanswered questions.”  Mrs Lawson says the school authorities have not met with her to explain what happened. She says: “In fact no one has said to me ‘we are sorry for what has happened whilst Jessica was in our care, we will do everything and anything to help you and your family’. “Nothing. We expected a duty of care to be afforded to us afterwards. How wrong we were to expect that. A wall of silence.” East Riding Council has said it is unable to comment while investigations are still taking place. A council spokeswoman said: “Regrettably, the council is not able to influence the speed of the judicial process by the French authorities and until those investigations are complete we are unable to comment further. “However, we do not underestimate the emotional impact this must be having on all concerned.” As the family approaches the third anniversary of Jessica’s death, it is difficult for them to keep their emotions in check but they say they know they must keep their daughter’s story in the public domain.  They have also met other UK families whose loved ones have died while abroad. Mrs Lawson says: “Sadly, the reality for many and the repeated story is that no one in authority steps in to help you when you are helpless.” The family are involved with government ministers and MPs government ministers and MPs to try and improve support for families when a tragedy like Jessica’s happens abroad. Through the Jessica Lawson Foundation they are working as part of a community project to promote drowning prevention, water safety and active supervision of children in or around water. They are working with the RNLI, RLSS and Humberside Fire \u0026amp Rescue on initiatives including a Water Safety and Drowning Prevention Information Board, at the Humber Bridge Country Park pond area. Mrs Lawson says: “This will be the first board. If it is seen as helping or beneficial we hope to continue with the work and install other boards in the Hull and East Riding area where open water is a potential danger.” Jessica has been remembered at her memorial bench in Kirk Ella, where a handmade angel was placed on Wednesday alongside a plaque remembering Jessica, Forever 12 years old.

Laura Harris, 43, sparked outrage across Britain when she was told a medicine she needed wasn\u0027t available from her own employer. The mum-of-two from of Barnstaple, Devon, was diagnosed with terminal bowel cancer and set up a fundraising page aimed at raising \u0026pound21,000 for the drug Bevacizumab that could extend her life. She was denied the drug from her employers after the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said in 2010 it would not be funded by the NHS because the benefits did not justify the costs. Thousands of strangers from across the world have now donated a total of nearly \u0026pound100,000 - enough for almost five blocks of the treatment. Laura has now taken three cycles of Bevacizumab alongside a new chemo drug and said her latest scan delivered her results she could only dream of. It showed no evidence of active disease - which she described as a type of remission.  Breaking the news to her followers and supporters on Facebook she wrote: I have some great news to share for all of you who shared or donated to my Go Fund Me so that I could buy chemotherapy for myself. I had a scan while in hospital and there is No Evidence of Active Disease in me anywhere. I\u0027m staying on this life extending treatment as long as possible. Thank you for saving my life. Laura said the results were more than she could ever have hoped for. She added: My cancer deposits have all shrunk down and been rendered inactive by my current treatment regime which I raised money for. This means none of my cancer is active or growing right now. My oncologist said about my recent CT scan results that \u0027my lungs look as if they\u0027ve never had cancer in them.\u0027 My family and I are understandably over the moon with these results. It shows the world that stage 4 cancer doesn\u0027t have to be an automatic death sentence.  Laura, mum to Molly, 14, and Noah, 16, and step-mum to Zach, eight, has been battling stage four bowel cancer since last year. But she astounded colleagues by returning to her work caring for fellow cancer patients at North District Hospital later that year. Laura came to the UK 20 years ago from America before qualifying as an oncology nurse in 2006.  Each block of the treatment costs \u0026pound21,000 and Laura initially hoped to raise enough for two. But after her story was publicised the donations came flooding in. Laura, who has now completed three cycles of the treatment, said they were keeping the GoFundMe page open to fund as many of them as possible.  She said: Of course the success of the treatment means I will continue on it as long as it continues to work. Thus we have left our fundraising page open for any who would want to donate towards my future treatment. These results are far beyond any we could have imagined. We were absolutely blown away. Due to the side effects of the chemo I was in hospital fighting an infection at the time they gave me the results. I was actually expecting bad news as I was feeling so unwell. It certainly perked me up to get such amazing results. The response we have had from my community and the world has truly been overwhelming. Never in a million years did we think we would get the support we have been given and continue to receive. My greatest wish, above all my bucket list items, is to reach the masses with my message. You are never too young, be vigilant over your own health and stage 4 cancer doesn\u0027t have to be a death sentence. I will keep using my time and energy and access to the press to push forward these messages.

The Prince of Wales has recreated the look and feel of his home for the centrepiece exhibition of the summer opening of Buckingham Palace. Charles selected more than 100 pieces from private family paintings and photographs, major art from the Royal Collection and work by up-and-coming artists for the attraction, which marks his 70th birthday year. Personal touches in the exhibition include poignant family photographs, from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s recent wedding, Prince George\u0027s official christening image and a picture of Charles holding his first grandchild with the Duke of Cambridge beside him.  One of the highlights of Prince \u0026amp Patron is Napoleon Bonaparte\u0027s red felt hooded cloak, a stunning artefact the heir to the throne knows well from Windsor Castle, where it was on display for a number of years. In audio commentary for exhibition visitors, Charles says about the cloak: Since, as a child, I first caught sight of this cloak in the Grand Vestibule at Windsor, I have been fascinated by the sheer magic of the colour, the dashing pattern of the lining and the enthralling story of Napoleon himself which it conjures up. It is said to have been worn by the Emperor during his Egyptian campaign and was taken from his carriage after the Battle of Waterloo 15 years later. The artwork is arranged on the walls of an octagonal room with tables filled with books by Charles, family snaps, vases and other decorative objects, while above are hung rows of paintings and other artworks, some with a tapestry as a backdrop. Vanessa Remington, senior curator of paintings at the Royal Collection Trust, said: It\u0027s a departure because it is not a standard museum display and the works aren\u0027t shown in isolation, they\u0027re shown in profusion very, very densely.  (Tables) are dressed with a range of objects and those are intended to show or give a flavour of the interiors of the Prince of Wales\u0027s own residences because this is a very personal show. The exhibition creates the impression of different areas of a drawing room from the prince\u0027s official London home Clarence House or his country retreat Highgrove in Gloucestershire. Ms Remington, curator of the exhibition, said the pieces do not have explanatory text next to them as they wanted to create a visual display rather than a museum display. In one section, painted oil sketches of William and Harry by Nicola Philipps are hung next to watercolours painted by Charles in the 1990s on the Queen\u0027s private Balmoral estate. Below are marble busts of the prince\u0027s great-great-great-grandparents Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, who themselves were well-known art lovers.  In the audio commentary, Charles says: I am very fond of the two preparatory oil sketches of my sons which I acquired from the artist, Nicky Philipps, in 2009. They were painted for a double portrait that now hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. Both are dressed in the regimental uniform of the Household Cavalry - the Blues and Royals - and are particularly good likenesses. The attraction also features work from students and artists from Charles\u0027s three arts organisations, the Royal Drawing School, the Prince\u0027s Foundation School of Traditional Arts and Turquoise Mountain, based in Kabul, Afghanistan. Some of their contributions feature Islamic-inspired artwork and other traditions from the Middle East, including a moving triple portrait of three Yezidi women painted in Iraq by Hannah Rose Thomas, after they had escaped Isis captivity.

And if there was any doubt as to just how fabulous the little princess is, it\u0027s about to vanish. That\u0027s because it\u0027s been revealed that Charlotte is worth more money than both of her brothers.   Reader\u0027s Digest have estimated the net worth of each member of the royal family.  Prince George is thought to be worth around \u0026pound2.7billion, with Louis, who was only born in April already predicted to boost the UK economy by \u0026pound50million before he turns one. However Charlotte takes the cake with a net worth of a whopping $5billion - that\u0027s \u0026pound3.8billion.  These calculations were based on the value the children bring to the economy, with the belief that the children have the potential to drive sales. The reason for Charlotte\u0027s incredibly high value is said to be predominantly due to her style influence, with people rushing out to buy the items she wears for their children. Often these pieces are purchased from high street brands and so are easier to get hold of and sell out in the blink of an eye - this is known as the Charlotte effect.

At Dave Lancaster\u0027s heaviest, he had type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, joint pain, high cholesterol, the beginnings of gout and sleep apnoea – a condition which can see a person stop breathing in their sleep. He said his immobility turned him into a recluse and although he was getting bigger, he felt \u0027his world was shrinking\u0027. But the call centre manager joined Slimming World in April 2016 and began walking every day - clocking up the total of a distance greater than from San Francisco to New York and back again​. He has lost 20stone 8lbs and no longer needs any medication for his health conditions. And he doesn\u0027t have to worry about fitting in seats on public transport, breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. The 45-year-old has gone from 34stone 8lbs and wearing a size 8XL with a 66in waist to 14stone and wearing size L clothes with a 36in waist.  Dave said: “I found it difficult to walk to the end of my road, I went out so rarely except for work that I was close to becoming a recluse and I was nearing almost complete immobility. It felt as though as I was getting bigger and bigger, my world was gradually shrinking.” But after changing his lifestyle, Dave said: “I can fit in the seat of any car I like and on buses, trains and planes. I don’t have to worry about breaking benches or garden furniture anymore. I can buy clothes on the high street and put my own socks on easily I can walk miles and run up and down the stairs - the list is endless. Dave, who lives alone in his hometown of Warwick, had been overweight all his life, apart from a brief period aged 16 to 18. He tried a range of weight-loss methods, including losing 10stone on a meal replacement diet in 2007. But he says it failed to educate him about food and he regained the weight he lost soon after. It was in April 2016 when Dave decided to give Slimming World a try and joined the local group run by his former neighbour Angie Baker.  I got a huge shock when I stepped on the scales and discovered I was nearly 3stone heavier than I’d expected, he said. I couldn’t believe what I’d done to my body and that evening, I’m not ashamed to say, I cried.” The following day though Dave filled his cupboards with healthy ingredients, cooking a range of dishes including stir-fries, salads and pasta from scratch. He said: “I like the emphasis on eating food that you prepare yourself rather than ready meals and processed food. And I found that I could still eat hearty meals while losing weight.” As Dave became more confident in the kitchen, he also began to share his creations with the rest of his slimming group via social media and posted about his weight-loss journey online.  He says the support he receives from others in person and online is invaluable. Inspired by other slimmers, Dave also began to be more active. He started walking around his local park, going from one bench to the next until he could walk longer distances without needing regular breaks.

He posted a screenshot of his phone\u0027s messaging screen, which showed a first message reading: I\u0027m making you come at 12 on Friday. Not recognising the number it was sent from, Cory took the message as some kind of joke, referring to a sexual hook up and sent back a sassy response.  He wrote: First off, you\u0027re not making me do s*** second off I don\u0027t remember scheduling and d*** appointments.

In a follow-up tweet he admitted that he hadn\u0027t responded to Maribel\u0027s message but revealed she had sent another. Her next message informed him she would be calling to discuss the terms of his employment. Which definitely didn\u0027t sound like a good sign for him. Cory added that he chose to ignore her call the next day, and would instead be going in to work to face her. But he was pretty worried about the whole thing. However, the awkward confrontation never happened. Instead, he chose to resign from his position on the front desk at a small web design company to avoid any further trouble.

Known as the \u0027Man of the Hole\u0027, or also the \u0027indigenous man in the hole\u0027, the tribesman can be seen wearing a loin cloth while hacking at a tree with a homemade tool. The footage was captured by Government officials in the jungle of Rondonia, Brazil. The man was first discovered by experts in 1996, while his face was filmed for the first time in 1998. It\u0027s thought he has spent the last 22 years alone after five of his fellow tribes people were murdered by farmers more than two decades ago.  Experts believe the \u0027indigenous man in the hole\u0027 is in his 50s and has spent his whole life surviving on pigs, birds, monkeys and plants of the jungle. Armed with homemade tools, like a bow and arrow, the man\u0027s life is believed to be dedicated almost entirely to hunting. Due to strict laws around interaction with isolated tribesmen, the Brazilian government know little about the man, including his name, age and original make-up of his tribe. Despite researchers monitoring him since his first discovery in 1996, the man has only been captured on film once before now.

Researchers found three decomposed mummies when they opened the 2,000 year old coffin. The bodies were lying in rancid sewer water in the black granite coffin which is the largest ever found in Alexandria. It was discovered earlier this month and many worried it might be cursed. When King Tutankhamun\u0027s tomb was opened in 1922, a number of people connected with the discovery subsequently died sparking rumours of a curse.  Mostafa Waziri, Secretary-General of Egypt\u0027s Supreme Council of Antiquities, has insisted there is no curse associated with the latest find. He said: The sarcophagus has been opened, but we have not been hit by a curse. We\u0027ve opened it and, thank God, the world has not fallen into darkness. I was the first to put my whole head inside the sarcophagus... and here I stand before you ... I am fine. Waziri said none of the three mummies were members of a Ptolemaic or Roman royal family.  No silver or gold metallic masks, statues, inscriptions or amulets were found inside the coffin, he added. Shaban Abd Monem, a specialist in mummies at the Ministry of Antiquities (MOA), said: “Preliminary examination suggests the skeletons belong to three army officers, one of them his skull shows an injury of an arrow. The MOA said the mummies and coffin will now be taken to Alexandria\u0027s National Restoration Museum where cause of death and the era will be determined. It was announced earlier this week that the MOA would open the tomb using thick pipes to open the lid so they could see inside. Dr. Ayman Ashmawy, head of the Ancient Egyptian Antiquities Sector, said the sarcophagus - built from granite and covered in mortar - was found five metres down. The tomb is nine feet long, five feet wide and six feet tall.

Our furry friends become just as much part of the family as anyone else, and owners who (for whatever reason) make this tough decision will want the best for their pet. While many people go through a shelter or charity to find a new home for their dog, classified sites such as Gumtree have also proven to be a popular choice. But be warned, if you do go down this route, using the phrase free to a good home - or words to that effect - may have devastating consequences.  This warning comes from a Queensland animal rescue shelter after one particularly distressing case.   Trixie is a young, loving 6 month-old pup whose owner could no longer care for her, so gave her away for free.  He\u0027d advertised the Staffordshire Bull Terrier/Rottweiler cross on a Facebook page.  Tellingly, the new owners then blocked Trixie\u0027s previous owner shortly after collecting her. Two weeks later Trixie turned up at a pound. Her severely swollen face showed she\u0027d sustained horrid facial injuries.   It\u0027s believed she was used as a bait dog to train fighting dogs .   Brisbane’s Happy Tails Animal Rescue have since warned pet owners that if they want to re-home a pet, they should go through a rescue group who can ensure certain safe-guarding measures.

Then it was a good header for the second.“That’s where I want him.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set to announce signing eleventh signing of the summer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to unveil former Falkirk defender Paul Watson.The 27-year-old will be Csaba Laszlo\u0026#8217s eleventh signing of the summer.Watson made 49 appearances for the Bairns in a three-year spell before being released by Paul Hartley at the end of last season.The centre back made 24 appearances last season \u0026#8211 including Falkirk\u0026#8217s 6-1 mauling of United in January.More soon\u0026#8230\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44857272341-e1531222515578-803x564.jpg ","title":"fans given chance to say last goodbye to dundee legend alan gilzean as casket laid in dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fans are being invited to pay their last respects to club legend Alan Gilzean ahead of his funeral.The ceremony will take place at Dundee Crematorium on Friday at 12.30pm, with close family and friends invited.Ahead of the ceremony, \u0026#8216Gillie\u0026#8217s\u0026#8217 family have allowed Dees a chance to say goodbye to the man who was part of the 1962 league winning side.His casket will be laid in the Alan Gilzean lounge within Dens Park tonight from 5.30pm to 7.30pm.Supporters looking to go along can enter the stadium through the Main Door beside the reception.On Friday Alan\u0026#8217s body will pass Dens Park one last time around 11.55am as the funeral cortege goes down the Provost Road.It will also pass Dens Road, Strathmartine Road, Clepington Road, McAlpine Road before making its way to the crematorium.Supporters are again invited to pay their respects along the route.Alan Gilzean made 190 appearances for Dundee and scored a remarkable 169 goals, making him to this day the side’s all-time top scorer.After his seven years in the Dark Blue of Dundee he moved to Tottenham where he also became a legend.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/Traffic-Scotland-tweet.jpg ","title":"give alan gilzean a proper dens park send off says dundee ace cammy kerr","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee favourite Cammy Kerr has called on the club’s supporters to give Alan Gilzean the send off the Dens legend deserves this weekend.The Dark Blues take on Dunfermline this Sunday in the first home game since Gilzean passed away at the age of 79.The club legend’s funeral takes place tomorrow and Sunday’s clash promises to be one full of emotion for everyone associated with Dundee.A special matchday programme will be available while there will be a minute’s silence and black armbands worn by the players but Kerr expects a bumper home crowd to give Gilzean a roaring send-off.The 22-year-old said: “It’s a terrible thing to happen.“Sadly, I never got to see him play or have the privilege of meeting him but what a figure to have played at this football club.“To know you are at the same football club as some of the greatest footballers have played at is fantastic.“I’d like to send my regards and best wishes to his family at this time, obviously a tough time.“In terms of the game, I think it will be emotional and, hopefully, the crowd turn out for a very special player for this football club.“I’ve read a few of things in the papers about the player he was and I actually remember watching the thing on TV at White Hart Lane when they closed the old stadium.“I knew he was a good player but I didn’t know how big he was for Tottenham.“When they said ‘The Original King of White Hart Lane, Alan Gilzean’ it just shows the regard he was held in down there.“Naming a lounge after him doesn’t do him justice because he was, obviously, a great talent.”Being a fan himself, Kerr knows the kind of supporters Dundee have and the loyalty they show their team – something he experienced in a very noisy welcome and send-off at last week’s friendly against Farense in Portugal.“We could hear them when we got off the bus in Albufeira but you can’t see how many there were,” Kerr added.“At the end I got a few photos and things and they were singing away.“The best bit was when we were leaving and they were all banging on the bus – it was great!“You see European games and all the fans waiting on the buses so it felt like that, it felt great.“For the fans to go across there just shows the loyalty that they’ll go across to Portugal for a friendly.

The groundsmen do a great job to give us a good pitch.“It’s always good to come out and have a game on the TV, it’s exciting, but Dunfermline are a side that will definitely try to push this year.“They’ve made some really important signings throughout their side and they’ll be a really tough test, so we’ll have to be firing on all cylinders.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51a9f41666b-e1532096343192.jpg ","title":"look out for these local men in the crystal maze tonight","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of Angus men will star in The Crystal Maze tonight.The Gamers team all hail from the county and applied to take part in the iconic show, which returned in 2016 after more than 20 years off the screen.William Stephen, 30, filled out the application on behalf of his team mates Matt Shaw, Neil McGregor, Ross Gauld and Matthew Tosh.Self-confessed Crystal Maze nut William, who runs Yard’s Games in Arbroath, said: “I’ve been able to see the episode ahead of time and there are a couple of moments that will be memorable, without a shadow of a doubt.“To be on the show is quite surreal – it was a ‘pinch me to see if it’s real’ sort of moment.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"man battered his mum with banana at dundee home","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA fruit-wielding thug who assaulted his mother with a banana had sentence deferred until August 7 at Dundee Sheriff Court.Graeme Murray, 40, of Exchange Street, admitted four charges dating from April 7, all committed at an address in Balunie Avenue.He admitted that on various occasions he behaved in a threatening or abusive manner by shouting, swearing, uttering threats of violence and banging on a fridge and a door.He also admitted that on various occasions he assaulted his mother Doreen Murray, 64, by pushing her against a worktop, seizing her by the hair, repeatedly hitting her head and body with a banana, throwing a banana at her and pushing her on a bed to her injury.He further admitted assaulting his stepfather James Murray, then aged 71, by seizing his head and repeatedly punching his head.He also admitted assaulting PC Ryan Shields by attempting to butt him.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b4f0793923bf-771x564.jpg ","title":"stirling albion or celtic its all the same to dundee new boy jean mendy","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn his very short time at Dundee, Senegalese striker Jean Mendy has already shown he can get fans off their seats at Dens Park this season.And he plans to continue doing that – as well as getting goals – whether he’s playing against Stirling Albion or Celtic, it’s all the same to him.He told the Tele: “I don’t know the teams at the moment!“For me, playing Stirling is like playing against Celtic, it’s the same for me – I just play my game, it doesn’t matter, and try to win every game.”The 28-year-old was delighted to start his career in dark blue with a goal after he knocked in a good strike from the edge of area as his new team began the season with a morale-boosting 4-0 victory at Stirling Albion.“It was good and we won of course – it’s very important to start winning,” Mendy added.“It was a little bit hot, I think, on the pitch on Saturday, we could feel it.“The performance was good, can be better you know, it was the first game but it was good to get the confidence with this game.“It was great for the team to score a lot of goals and we have shown we have people who can score.“I was pleased to get the goal, I got the chance and I put it in.“It was perfect for me to start with a goal and good for my confidence so I’m very happy to start like this.”Mendy joined the club from Belgian top-flight side Lokeren where he struggled to make an impact.That was after piling in the goals in the Norwegian lower leagues.Back in 2012, he banged in 27 goals in 25 league games for Elverum in the third tier before 27 in 52 in the next tier for Kristiansund. A move up to the top flight only brought a return of six in 23 for Sandefjord before returning to Kristiansund and then getting the big move to Belgium.Manager Neil McCann said he’d been keeping an eye on Mendy’s progress after missing out on him when he departed Norway.He’s finally got his man and the forward is delighted to be at Dundee, even if he’s not spent much time in the city with the club spending a week-long training camp in Portugal.He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time so far, it’s a good club with good players, too, and I think this year will be a good one.“Portugal was a lot of training. That sort of preparation is normal and it was good for us but you feel it when we played the games over there.“We didn’t get the wins in the friendlies, maybe one win against Sunderland but we lost the last two but they were only friendlies – more important is winning the games when the season begins, like Saturday.“It was very good to show we are ready.“There are a few new players, myself as well, and it’s very important for us to get together with the team and start to know each other in training, talk together and know how we all play.“It’s looking good. We’ll obviously continue to work more but I think the season will be good.”After starting off Group D with victory, Mendy and his new team-mates take on Dunfermline at home in front of the television cameras on Sunday.Even if he doesn’t know much about his opponents just yet, Mendy knows the Dundee fans will be expecting a good show from their side and he’s hoping to add to his goal tally.“I’m looking forward to my first home game this weekend.“That will be very important in front of our supporters.“Of course, we want to play a good game, put on a show for the fans and win the game, too.“We

What will happen is that one person turns up and uses it and then another and another.\"We have had one wee lad learn to ride his bike here as he was too frightened to learn anywhere else. We have had people playing Frisbee.\"A lot of people from the Highland Council offices have being coming here for lunch and Cheshire House have twice been here with a group of their people.\"Many have said they have been here for events but find it is a completely different place when it is a piece of grass. They are loving it and enjoying the peace and quiet.\"Others have used it as a thoroughfare as part of their daily commute while the Northern Constabulary Pipe Band also took the opportunity to hold its rehearsals in the park one evening.The idea of a community buyout is being driven by the Northern Counties Cricket Club, one of the park\u0027s main users.Mr Ford, who is a club member, believes such a move will be good for the club, the community and Inverness \u0026ndash and the buildings which are deteriorating.\"Without investing time and money, they could be mothballed and if that happens, we would not be able to use the park,\" he said.\"To me, a community buyout is common sense.

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:35

suspension bridge linking Bught Road with Whin Island will close this Monday for \"essential repairs\" as part of wider refurbishment of footpaths within the Ness Islands.The move will temporarily cut off access to the beauty spot from the west side of the River Ness at a time when visitor numbers are at their highest.And that decision has sparked questions from puzzled councillors, who have asked why work is beginning now \u0026ndash 13 months after the cash for it was signed off and three months after work elsewhere on the latest phase got underway.They have also criticised the short one week notice period given to the public.Inverness West councillor Alex Graham, said: \"It was very disappointing that [the public] were given such short notice of the work, particularly because it is used as the main access to the Ness Islands from the Bught side [of the river] and of course it\u0027 also part of the Great Glen Way route as well so it\u0027 important to tourists as well as locals.\"I

work?\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also raised concerns, and highlighted the impact the closure could have on people heading to and from local events, such as the open air Little Mix concert on Sunday, July 29.She added that if the work needed settled weather and low river levels, it could have been carried out months before now thanks to the exceptionally dry spring and summer the Highlands has experienced.\"I can\u0026rsquot understand it,\" she said. \"Why not start in April or early May \u0026ndash they could have had it done.\"I\u0026rsquom not happy with the timing,

They could\u0026rsquove saved lots of hassle if they\u0026rsquod just got on with it.\"Someone probably needs to get their knuckles rapped. It\u0027 such bad timing. If it was that dangerous and bad why not carry out the work before. And if it\u0027 not dangerous why not leave it [to a quieter time]?\"\"They could easily do it in September.\"Highland Council insisted the timing was due to the need for a settled weather window, and that the Monday start date was designed to avoid this weekend\u0027 Inverness Highland Games.A spokeswoman said: \"The council apologises for any inconvenience that this will cause and is mindful of the fact that the closure is taking place throughout the summer, however the works are necessary for the essential maintenance of the bridge and the closure is for public safety.\"The timing of the refurbishment in the summer season is necessary as it provides the best weather conditions to get the work done safely with lower river levels.\"Meanwhile, the council has urged the public to stop attaching so-called \u0026lsquolove locks\u0026rsquo to bridges, and plans to remove any it finds during the repair work. It also called on people not to place stickers on lamps, benches or bridges.\"The padlocks cause rust and both stickers and padlocks damage paintwork,\" they said. \"All existing padlocks and stickers will be removed as part of the refurbishment works and the council\u0027 plea is to leave no trace.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"lewis friendly is perfect prep for europa league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tJoe Lewis believes tonight’s friendly with West Brom is great preparation for facing Burnley in the Europa League.This evening’s meeting with the English Championship Baggies at Pittodrie is Aberdeen’s final game before they play the Clarets in the first leg of the Europa League second qualifying round on Thursday.Darren Moore’s team were relegated from the Premier League last season, but Dons goalie Lewis, pictured, believes their style is similar to Sean Dyche’s side and thinks facing them will be good for the Reds as they prepare for the start of the European campaign next week.He said: “It’s excellent preparation because although they have just been relegated they’ve still go a lot of quality in their side. “There are signs that they have turned the corner. “They finished the season well and there was a lot of positivity around the appointment of the manager. “When they went down they were expected to go down, they’d come to terms with that and started preparing properly for this season already.“It can be difficult to play friendlies against similar opposition. “We’ll know the type of team that Burnley are and I don’t think West Brom will be much different.“Playing West Brom will definitely be good preparation for the Burnley game.”Boss Derek McInnes also sees the game as a good test for his players, but the most important thing for him is that no more injuries are picked up ahead of facing Burnley.McInnes said: “I think the level of opposition is clearly going to be a good test.“For us in light of what has gone on it’s not the most important thing in terms of a result.“We want to add to the fitness, but the biggest thing is that we come through without any injuries.“I want us to be stronger going into Monday’s working week.“We’ll recover over the weekend and get some training into players over the weekend.“But I’m really hopeful that on Monday morning we have a bigger depth of squad to choose from.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"win tickets to see the lady boys of bangkok in aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWe have a pair of tickets up for grabs for the popular Lady Boys of Bangkok show in Aberdeen!So prepare for a night you’ll talk about for years as they flirt, tease and tempt!No one will leave the show without a smile on their face and a song in their heart.To be in with a chance of winning the tickets for the 7pm showing on Thursday, simply fill in our form below.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/NATIVE_ARTICLE_700_Regency_Place_2_Article.jpg ","title":"live life to the full at countesswells","story":"\t\t\t\t\tEveryone wants something different from life in a new home.

the Event Complex Aberdeen (TECA).That means all of the signs saying “AECC” will need to be altered or even replaced.It is understood the cost of making the changes will fall to the centre’s owner SMG Europe.However, it has not yet been decided if that will involve altering or removing the incorrect signs.Any changes can be requested by the developer – in this case SMG – and Transport Scotland, along with the local authority, will make the alterations.A Transport Scotland spokesman said: “The strategic signing policy was agreed with the local authority and any changes to the signage has to be agreed with them.”An Aberdeen City Council spokeswoman said changes “would have to be agreed with Transport Scotland” and referred inquiries to TECA’s operator SMG Europe.A spokeswoman for SMG Europe, which operates the venue, would only say: “Discussions are under way into this matter.”SNP group leader councillor Stephen Flynn said it would be “beyond embarrassing” if the signage was wrong.He said: “I agree with those folk who have said that TECA is a fairly uninspiring name change and would prefer not to see it on any sign.“However, if they are to press ahead with the new title then it would be beyond embarrassing not to have signage to match.“Ultimately, it’s really poor that there doesn’t appear to have been much, if any, communication between partners on such a simple issue and any changes shouldn’t be borne by the public purse.”Liberal Democrat councillor Ian Yuill added: “It is important that the signage is clear.“Given that SMG Europe decided on a different name for the AECC and that TECA will be its name going forward, it makes sense that the signs should use that name.“I do believe that SMG Europe should be fronting any costs to make those changes.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen bypass closures postponed for a week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans to close a slip road at the Charleston flyover this weekend have been postponed for a

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a look at the advertiser of yesteryear","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 11:54 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowWith the success of the Islay Mòd still fresh in our minds, it is clear that taking part in regional and the national Mòd is a long-standing tradition for Mid Argyll youngsters.For more than 20 years Mid Argyll students have done us proud at the Gaelic singing competitions, as seen here in our edition from 1998, when singers from all over Argyll made their way to the Royal National Mòd on the Isle of Skye.The Lochgilphead Primary Gaelic Choir came fourth in their competition, with the Lochfyneside Junior Gaelic Choir gaining top music mark in their unison singing competition.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

Opinion in piping circles is that resurgence in pipe bands is seeing more pipers choose bands instead of pursuing solo careers.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sports club lotteries 7","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowDrawn on Monday July 16, Tarbert Football Club’s lottery numbers were 12, 15 and 17.There were no winners, so next week’s prize will be £400.Also drawn on Monday, Kilmory Camanachd Club\u0026#8217s lottery numbers were 1, 6, and 8.There were no winners so next week\u0026#8217s jackpot will be £400.Inveraray Shinty Club’s lottery numbers were 3, 6 and 18.There were no winners this week, so next week\u0026#8217s prize will be £900.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the first kilberry loop cycle sportive takes off","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:10 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCycling enthusiasts are gearing up for the first cycling sportive based in Mid Argyll.There is just one month to go until the start of the inaugural Kilberry Loop Cycle, which will take place on August 11.Organiser of the non-competative event, the Mid Argyll Tri \u0026amp Cycle Club, is an all inclusive club for athletes and sporting enthusiasts of all ages and abilities.A spokesperson for the club told the Argyllshire Advertiser this week: \u0026#8216We wish to promote fun, fellowship and friendship with a dash of competition.\u0026#8216The Kilberry Loop is a favourite route of the members. It is widely recognised as one of the most complete cycles in Argyll and we wish to introduce this gem to the wider cycling community and remind the people of Kintyre that this wondrous route is within their midst.\u0026#8217Registration for the event will open at 7.30am, with the cycle starting from the Isthmus, Tarbert. Entrants will then head east towards the village and then north on the A83 before turning left at the junction with the B8024 on to a single track road.This is where the fun begins, with a steady climb for about 2kms before the fast descent into Achahoish and the beginning of wonderful scenery as the loop continues along the shores of Loch Caolisport.The breathtaking views to Jura, Islay and Gigha demand a quick stop for a photograph. There will be a feed station at approximately the half way mark.The route continues through Kilberry, heading east, with some short sharp climbs and sweeping descents, before following the coast of West Loch Tarbert north, passed the Tarbert Golf Club, before a left turn at the junction with the A83 and back to Tarbert and the finish.The loop is suitable for road bikes  the road surface is variable but generally reasonable, and there are a few steep descents, so some caution is required.The club spokesperson continued: \u0026#8216We are hopeful we\u0026#8217ll get more than 50 entrants on the start line, so please sign up. There\u0026#8217s almost enough time to start putting in some training.The minimum age for our entrants is 16 years old on the day of the event, with a parent or  who will accompany them during the cycle.So come along and take up the challenge, have some fun and improve your fitness.\u0026#8217\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12951950.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_300618station_10JPG.jpg","title":"ayrs station hotel faces 3","story":"NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel faces £3 million demolition bill as South Ayrshire Council fear dangerous building is beyond repairCouncil bosses fear a multi-million pound job is on to bring down the crumbling Station Hotel.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson11:50, 20 JUL 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Station Hotel (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDemolition of the crumbling Station Hotel will cost \u0026pound3million, we can reveal. Council bosses have sized up the task, fearing the iconic structure has reached the end of the line. Large parts of Ayr railway station are closed to the public as safety teams comb the site. But the Post has learned that even a short-term salvage mission will cost more than \u0026pound300,000. Senior councillors have been briefed to expect a hefty hit to the wallet. South Ayrshire bosses will bid to retrieve whatever they spend from the hotel’s absentee Malaysian owner. But a senior adminsitration source said: “We have to face the reality of the situation. “The cost of refurbishing the hotel would be well in excess of \u0026pound10m, so that’s a non-starter. “I think that knocking it down is quickly becoming our only option.” That prospect is likely to face a strong challenge from groups such as Historic Scotland. And political tensions could further complicate the picture.  It comes as the hotel’s safety cordon was extended to take in part of the road over the railway. Teams are inspecting the condition of the building’s gable end amid concerns it could collapse on to people and cars below. Trains continue to run as normal, but access for commuters has now become fraught with difficulty. And worried rail chiefs are now said to be hatching contingency plans, should Ayr become become a no-go zone. But council bosses this week refused to confirm whether an official briefing on demolition had taken place. In a statement, they said: “Work to fully assess the condition of the former Station Hotel is continuing on site. “However, a decision on any future action will be dependent on the findings of the ongoing works and surveys.” But the council’s opposition group claim they are being kept in the dark over developments. Tory boss, Martin Dowey, said the public need to be kept informed. “I’m surprised this figure appears to be being quoted by members of the administration,” he added. “The SNP’s claim of inclusion and transparency is just one more empty promise. “The public need to be kept informed about the hotel and the council’s plans for its future, if that does indeed involve demolition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnHistoric ScotlandScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTransportAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12945474.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_IBP_AYP_110718WINDOW_01JPG.jpg","title":"ayr window cleaner keith mckissock","story":"NewsAyr window cleaner Keith McKissock says South Ayrshire Council parking wardens are \"stopping\" him from workingFurious Keith McKissock claims he is being \"stopped\" from going about his business in Ayr town centre.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson10:49, 19 JUL 2018NewsKeith has won support from customers and some councillors (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA popular window cleaner claims council bosses are blocking his bid to work. Keith McKissock washes up to 50 properties – many of them businesses – in Ayr town centre. But the dad-of-two faces a stand-off with parking wardens on his tail. Keith, who runs Craigie Cleaning Services, wants a special permit allowing his van into town. But despite offers to pay an annual fee, red tape and fines have dogged his progress. The 53-year-old said: “I’m just trying to go about my work – what I do actually improves the town. “If I wasn’t cleaning these windows, would the council? “I can’t carry 22 litres of water on my back with all my ladders. “Maybe they expect me to balance everything on my bike.”  Keith, once a top Scottish cyclist, was backed all the way by customers this week. Kenny McLachlan, of Ayr, said: “Keith’s been washing our windows for five years and you couldn’t meet a harder working guy. “The High Street needs all the support it can get – we shouldn’t be harassing people doing it a turn.”  Now Tory councillors are  hoping to ride to the cleaner’s rescue by proposing a new parking charter.  Group chief Martin Dowey said: “Examples exist in other councils where they charge an annual window cleaner permit. “Keith is someone who legitimately services our High Street and there needs to be a common sense solution.” Ayrshire’s roads boss Stewart Turner said: “Vehicles can’t remain in the same location for longer than 10 minutes without activity. “In addition, it is not possible to move a vehicle from one bay to another in attempt to buy time. “In Mr McKissock’s case, he can use the bays to undertake cleaning operations but can’t use them to park or collect money from customers. “He was recently asked to move his vehicle from a bay by a parking attendant as he was not carrying out any window cleaning activities. “The Alliance wrote to Mr McKissock, once again, regarding his behaviour towards our parking attendants. “Our employees deserve to be treated with respect and we have a responsibility to protect them.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"former wwe star hurricane tops","story":"NewsFormer WWE star The Hurricane tops bill as Pro Wrestling Elite stages anniversary show at Ayr CitadelPWE will stage their latest extravaganza - and are promising fans one of their biggest and best shows yet.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet16:03, 19 JUL 2018NewsPWE will stage their big event this weekend (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGrappling fans are in for a treat this weekend as a host of wrestling stars will descend on Ayr.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"vandal hunt after cars vandalised","story":"NewsVandal hunt after cars are vandalisedNeighbours are furious about old cars the owner refuses to move\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston12:29, 18 JUL 2018Updated12:33, 18 JUL 2018NewsFour motors are always parked at Raithhill (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIT’S a highly curious tale that’s causing unrest in an Alloway neighbourhood. A line of four cars all belonging to the same man have hardly turned a wheel for more than a DECADE. The road beneath them is a weed and dirt splattered state, tarnishing the pleasant surroundings of the horseshoe-shaped Raithhill. Every year the forlorn fleet is removed with the help of the AA to ensure they get their MOT and are road legal. And when they are away, a reserve takes their place in case someone else grabs the spot. Last week the story emerged as the cars’ owner Derek Cumming - who runs a chartered accountancy business in Ayr - told police his cars had been vandalised. Police then issued a statement saying the damage had been of “significant financial impact on the owners of these vehicles.” Ayr CID said they are “speaking to the community and reviewing CCTV” and added damage happened between May 1 and June 26. But far from sympathy from residents who insisted the cars were a menace and claimed Mr Cumming couldn’t care less about the annoyance they caused. Neighbours claimed Mr Cumming does not stay in the villa, which was owned by his late mother, and that he lives in nearby Glenalla Crescent. Meanwhile, the cars remain at Raithhill. Usual residents are an 18-year-old silver AUDI TT convertible, two Mercedes SL500’s aged 10 and 11 and usually a Range Rover rather than the 16-year-old Toyota Avensis. On closer inspection there is no significant vandalism to the four cars currently there other than a few minor scrapes and scratches. The Audi and the red Mercedes have small scrapes to the pavement side which look like it has been “keyed.” The Mercedes also has a small panel missing next to the rear window. Residents queued-up to tell the Ayrshire Post of their displeasure. One lady said: “You won’t get any sympathy for him here. Nobody can understand what he is playing at and he doesn’t care he causes us upset.” Another lady added: “In the winter when there is ice it is actually dangerous as we don’t want to hit his cars. “There is grass growing through the tarmac as the council road sweeper cannot get to it. “The so-called vandalism looks nothing to me . . . in fact if that is all there has been in 10 years then he should count himself lucky. “It was his mother’s house and his aunt also used to live there.” And a gent added: “It obviously costs money to keep them road legal and the cars are usually taken away at night so they can get a new MOT. “The batteries are down so the AA has to re-start them. “Three of the cars have private plates and he is doing nothing wrong, but the mind boggles as to why. “Sadly there doesn’t seem to be anything we can do about it but it seems they are there to spite someone and is so infantile. “He once put flower pots down his driveway because he thought neighbours were parking there.” Sixty-three-year-old Mr Cumming runs an accountancy firm in Cathcart Street. This week he was unrepentant he was causing the neighbours stress. Asked why the cars had been there for up to 13 years, he replied: “Because that is my home.” When it was put to him that he actually lived in Glenalla Crescent, he said: “That’s my home. Nothing is bizarre. I do live in the house. “Don’t report anything outwith the police report. “I can park cars legally and that is the end of the matter. I have no further comment.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

the use of artificial intervention and some raising fears that science was creating \u0026ldquoFrankenbabies, but also paved the way for around eight million IVF births across the world to

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.  Details of what happened have not been released publicly, although the Courier understands that it followed a private function on the premises the previous evening.  In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.  The board agreed to transfer the licence to Mr Hughes, wishing him luck with the venture."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8031076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"haddington-food-assembly-announces-shock-closure","story":"  The assembly, which has been running for two years, revealed it would no longer be able to operate earlier this week.  Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.

Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.  Mr Bruce said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoShe has done really well and she is an excellent drummer.  \u0026ldquoShe is onto the development band and that will open up lots of opportunities for her in the future.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.  As well as his time with MacBrayne, the book looks at Kit\u0026rsquos dad\u0026rsquos time in the Armed Forces, as well as becoming a sub-postmaster in Aviemore as the town evolved from a \u0026ldquosleepy former railway junction into its present skiing and outdoor pursuits centre.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The rise was driven by\u0026nbsp1.9 million visits by European tourists, up\u0026nbsp17% on 2016.  Spending by visitors from Europe increased by 36% to \u0026pound1.1 billion.  In contrast across the UK as a whole, the number of European visitors increased by 1% while spending fell by 1%.  The Scottish Government attributed the rise to factors including the popularity of the Scotland-set television series Outlander, digital campaigns by tourism agency VisitScotland, and events\u0026nbspassociated with the Year of History, Heritage and Archaeology.  The figures are published amid ongoing debate about the impact of tourism at popular destinations such as the Isle of Skye.

Her birth attracted controversy, with religious leaders expressing concern about the use of artificial intervention and some raising fears that science was creating \u0026ldquoFrankenbabies, but also paved the way for around eight million IVF births across the world to date.  Mrs Brown, now a mother-of-two\u0026nbspliving in Bristol with her husband, Wesley Mullinder, said that the contribution of embryologist Jean Purdy deserved greater recognition, alongside the better-known involvement of gynaecologist Patrick Steptoe and physiologist Robert Edwards.  Purdy, who was initially hired as a lab technician by Edwards, was the first person to witness the successful cell division of the embryo that would become Louise Brown.  She co-authored 26 academic papers\u0026nbspabout IVF and helped found the Bourn Hall fertility clinic in Cambridgeshire, but is rarely mentioned in the story of IVF.  Purdy died in 1985, aged 39.  Mrs Brown, who works as a clerk at a freight company, said: \u0026ldquoJean Purdy was, I was told by my mum, the one who saw all the cells dividing which is now me.  \u0026ldquoWithout her I don\u0026rsquot think IVF would have taken off.  \u0026ldquoI know Bob and Patrick used to go home to their wives and families and I think it was Jean that used to stay and make sure everything was just as it should have been.  She described them as \u0026ldquothree great people and said she hopes Purdy \u0026ldquogets the recognition she deserves now.  She was speaking at Bourn Hall to mark 40 years of IVF, and earlier laid flowers at Purdy\u0026rsquos new memorial at the Church of St Andrew and St Mary in Grantchester where she is buried.  There was previously a simple headstone which did not acknowledge Purdy\u0026rsquos work.  Steptoe died in 1988 aged 74, and Edwards died in 2013 aged 87.  Edwards, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in 2010 for the development of IVF, had previously said \u0026ldquothere were three original pioneers in IVF not\u0026nbspjust two.  \u0026ldquoThey should have all been recognised more than they were, Mrs Brown said.  She said her parents received \u0026ldquoweird mail over the years, including a package from California containing a broken test tube with a foetus and fake blood, but that she had never had any \u0026ldquonasty approaches and \u0026ldquodefinitely not recently.  \u0026ldquoI think there\u0026rsquos so many IVF children now that I think it\u0026rsquos a lot more accepted now 40 years on than it was when I was born, she said. \u0026ldquoI think everybody\u0026rsquos sort of moved mostly with the times.  Grace MacDonald, mother of Alastair MacDonald, the second ever IVF baby and first ever IVF baby boy, who was born on January 14 1979, said Purdy deserved more recognition but she would not have minded the lack of it.  \u0026ldquoI always got the feeling that she loved being part of it all but she loved being in the background, she said. \u0026ldquoShe never sought or wanted to be a star although to me she always was as she was the one I felt that held it all together, kept the notes, looked after the girls at that time.  \u0026ldquoShe just had an amazing way about her."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7490052.jpg?htype=1032\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"humza-yousafs-thumbs-up-to-hilarious-memes-poking-fun-at-his-official-government-pictures","story":"  The internet has delighted in poking fun at the new Justice Secretary\u0026rsquos official \u0026ldquoserious and \u0026ldquosmiling Scottish Government by satirising them to illustrate good and bad news.

The new Dairy Milk bar will sit alongside the original on shelves and offer consumers greater choice, the company said.  Glenn Caton, Mondelez International president for Northern Europe, said the science behind the reformulation was a \u0026ldquotrade secret but said some of the sugar had been replaced with fibre to maintain the original bar\u0026rsquos structure and texture.  He described the taste of the new bar as \u0026ldquoincredibly similar to the original, saying: \u0026ldquoIt tastes very, very close to the original but a little less sweet. It\u0026rsquos been tested extensively on consumers and they love it.  Mondelez said a team of 20 scientists, nutritionists and chocolatiers worked for almost two years at its Reading and Bournville units to cut sugar without adding any artificial sweeteners, colours or preservatives.  The calorie content remains similar between the two bars, but the sugar content has dropped from 56g per 100g in the original bar to 39g per 100g in the new version.  Mondelez said it would look to apply the approach to other Cadbury Dairy Milk products if it proves successful with consumers.  It also unveiled plans for the next two years to release its Cadbury Boost+ Protein bar with 32% less sugar, 30% lower sugar versions of its Maynards Bassetts Wine Gums and Jelly Babies products and a line of its BelVita breakfast biscuits with 40% less sugar.  Longer term plans include a reformulation of Cadbury Brunch bars to cut sugar by around 20% and a lower sugar version of Oreo biscuits.  Mr Caton said the company recognised that consumers wanted to manage their sugar intake.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur brands have been around for hundreds of years. They are a part of British culture and heritage and play a special role in people\u0026rsquos lives as treats to be enjoyed during a moment of indulgence.  \u0026ldquoTaking sugar out of our products isn\u0026rsquot easy and will take time.

Football experts have already \u0026ldquored flagged moves for two internationalists - France\u0026rsquos Florent Sinama Pongolle and Russia\u0026rsquos Konstantin Rausch - which involved payments to opaquely owned firms registered in Edinburgh and London respectively.  British shell firms - marketed off-the-peg across the former Soviet Union and beyond as vehicles for secrecy and tax avoidance - have been embroiled in numerous major fraud, corruption and money-laundering scandals in recent years.  The UK Government this weekend ends a consultation on how to reform the most notoriously abused British corporate entity, the Scottish limited partnership or SLP.  Russian investigative journalists have revealed secret payments to an SLP when Mr Pongolle, a former Liverpool striker, was transferred from Sporting Lisbon to FK Rostov in 2012.  More recently Moscow\u0026rsquos Dinamo has dismissed its general director after discovering payments made to an English limited liability partnership or LLP when it signed Mr Rausch, a wing back, from Germany\u0026rsquos Koeln earlier this year.    Konstantin Rausch  SNP MP and Motherwell fan Alison Thewliss has been leading attempts to in the House of Commons to convince the Conservatives to take a tougher line on SLPs and UK corporate governance.  She said: \u0026ldquoIt seems there are no limits to the areas where dirty money, laundered through Scottish Limited Partnerships, will go.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos particularly frustrating to see this money seeping into football and the purchase of players - we all want to see our team win, but this shouldn\u0026rsquot come at any cost.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government\u0026rsquos consultation on SLPs closes next week - they must use this opportunity to clamp down on dubious shell firms and protect the reputation of the beautiful game.    Alison Thewliss  Former Scottish First Minister Henry McLeish - a former professional footballer for Leeds United - has long been concerned about what he called \u0026ldquobackroom financial dealings in his sport.  Mr McLeish said: \u0026ldquoTo retain the trust and respect of supporters we must have probity and scrutiny. This extends to so-called shell companies  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government must clamp down on these structures. Football is global and so is finance. We have to be aware of what is happening in our sport: we need a clean game based on clean money.    Henry McLeish  Dynamo\u0026rsquos chairman Vladimir Strzhalkovsky discovered a payment of 1.25m euros to an LLP called Golden Toys, according to recent news media reports in both Germany and Russia. Mr Strzhalkovsky, a former KGB officer and tycoon close to Putin whose son bought a stately home in Scotland this year, is understood to have reported the matter to the authorities. There is no suggestion that Mr Rausch, who missed the World Cup through injury, was involved.  Moscow newspaper Novaya Gazeta uncovered a payment of 650,000 euros from Rostov to an SLP called Trademarket Networks as part of Mr Pongolle\u0026rsquos transfer. The paper cites bank records showing the money was passed on to a now closed English LLP called Drensler. From there, it alleges, cash ended up in the account of a club official.

The organisers of the ECI cited Brexit as the reason for submitting the petition and the future possible loss of EU citizenship and rights by UK nationals.  \u0026ldquoThe main objective of the proposed initiative is to guarantee that European citizenship and its associated rights cannot be lost once they have been attained, the Commission said.  \u0026ldquoThe organisers cite in particular the context of Brexit and the future loss of EU citizenship and rights to UK citizens, it added.  A Commission spokesperson said that the decision to register the initiative concerns only the legal admissibility of the proposal and that it had yet not analysed the substance of the petition.    Petitioners will need to get a total of at least one million signatures\u0026nbspthat includes residents in at least seven EU nations.  The Commission can then decide either to back the request or not, and in both instances would be required to explain its reasoning.  The organisers say in the text of the petition that it aims to \"uphold the right of Union citizens to move and reside freely within the territory of member states under objective conditions of freedom and dignity\u0026nbspand to safeguard citizens of the Union from use as bargaining chips in negotiations under Article 50...\"  It requests the Commission \"submit a proposal to retain the rights of EU citizenship for all those who have already exercised their freedom of movement prior to the departure of a members state\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspleaving the Union, and for those nationals of a departing state who wish to retain their status as citizens of the union.\"  The organisers of the move which includes seven nationals from\u0026nbspBritain, France, Italy, Germany, Republic of Ireland, Greece and Belgium say a separate passport\u0026nbsp\"might be issued as a consequence of this\" if the suggestion is approved.  The organisers say: \"Retaining European Citizenship aims to appeal to all citizens of the European Union. Citizenship - and the rights and responsibilities that go with it - should not so easily be stripped away from European citizens.    \"We are concerned with those who wish to retain their citizenship, with EU nationals in the UK who face an uncertain future as a result of Brexit, with UK nationals residing in EU countries and with all those who want to defend their citizenship.\"  EU citizenship guarantees freedom of movement in the EU and other rights  Brits were expected to lose their EU citizenship after Brexit is in effect, either in March 2019 or at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  EU citizenship would not replace British nationality but would\u0026nbspbe additional to national citizenship.  It would grant specific rights such as the right to travel and live anywhere in the EU and the right to vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections where they are living.  It would also\u0026nbspallows EU citizens to get diplomatic protection and consular help from any EU country wherever they are in the world, even if their own country does not have a local embassy.  The petition asks that people who wish to retain their EU citizenship after Brexit be allowed to do so.  The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - two years after Prime Minister Theresa May triggered the exit process by invoking Article 50.  And Westminster\u0026nbsphas been adamant that free movement would end at the end of the transition period in December 2020.  In a parliamentary answer on the citizenship question, Lord Ahmad of the Foreign Office said \"when the UK ceases to be a member of the European Union, British nationals will no longer hold EU citizenship, unless they hold dual nationality with another EU member state\".  Lord Callanan of the Department for Exiting the European Union said retaining EU citizenship for Britons post-Brexit had not been ruled out, but it \"would involve changing treaties\". \"The other side [EU negotiators] has shown no interest whatever in doing it,\" he added."},{"url":null,"title":"councils-set-to-be-handed-powers-to-banish-lap-dancing-clubs","story":"  A new licensing regime would hand local authorities greater control over the number of sexual entertainment venues operating in their boundaries.

Cosla, which represents local government and lobbies on its behalf, backed giving councils \u0026ldquothe ability to control the number and location of such venues in their areas.  Responding to a consultation on the proposals, it said it was \u0026ldquovery difficult to see how a commitment to eradicating violence against women and girls could sit alongside the licensing of sexual entertainment venues.  It said current Government guidance \u0026ldquodoes not recognise that working in the sexual entertainment industry is for most people not about choice, but about exploitation, and one in which women are disproportionately represented.  Violence Against Women Partnerships (VAWP) insisted the Scottish Government should work with councils to outlaw lap-dancing clubs.  But venue operators said it was \u0026ldquounfair and untrue to imply that lap-dancing is a form of violence against women.  Brightcrew, operators of Platinum Lace in Glasgow, argued its performers \u0026ldquoare all strong, independent, talented women who choose to work in sexual entertainment.  It added: \u0026ldquoIt is a well-remunerated occupation. It is a form of performance. It provides great flexibility in terms of hours and days of work, meaning that performers can work when they like, ensuring that they can find a balance between their work and other demands on their time, be it family, other work or studies.  The Scottish Government said it would consider the consultation responses before bringing in new rules.  Provisions to create a new licensing regime were voted through Holyrood in 2015 as part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act.  The legislation allows councils to decide whether they want to licence sexual entertainment venues and set the number able to operate in their area.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoLicensing of sexual entertainment venues does not seek to ban lap dancing or strip clubs but to allow local licensing authorities to decide what is right for their area.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government accepts the freedom of adults to engage in legal activities and employment.  \u0026ldquoHowever, it will continue to promote, through all relevant means, gender equality and actions that tackle out-dated attitudes that denigrate or objectify particular groups or individuals."},{"url":null,"title":"bifab-workers-accuse-bosses-of-ditching-full-time-staff-in-favour-of-agencies","story":"  In a statement addressed to Scottish ministers, they said such a move would \u0026ldquoseriously damage any hope of winning new contracts.

She said: \"Trade unions and the workforce deserve praise for their courageous fight to protect jobs.  \"Laying off the highly-skilled core workforce would devastate families and communities \u0026ndash and lead to a loss of skills and experience that would be impossible to replace.  \"The SNP government simply cannot be in a position where it has allowed itself to be a facilitator for making skilled workers redundant and replaced with insecure agency work.  \"That is an outrage and SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay must immediately address these reports and take swift action to ensure these skills are not lost for good.\"  Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said the SNP Government had been \u0026ldquoeasily duped by this company and has now cleared the way for the casualisation of the workforce.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove heard very little from the SNP since they press released saving the yard back in April. BiFab workers are right to feel betrayed.  But a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe are in regular contact with BiFab \u0026ndash including a meeting between ministers and senior representatives that took place this week.  \u0026ldquoWe have made a long term investment in the company, however we do not participate in operational management decisions.  \u0026ldquoIt was clear at the point new ownership was secured that conditions would remain challenging for the yards and new contracts would have to be won to secure future work.  \u0026ldquoThe workforce played a major role in securing new investment for the yards and the prospect of securing future contracts which DF Barnes is working toward.  \u0026ldquoWe have confidence that everything possible is being done to secure new contracts and restore employment to previous levels."},{"url":null,"title":"sixty-pianos-are-the-key-to-a-playable-fringe-venue","story":"  The Pianodrome, when constructed, will be placed on the Pyrus Lawn at the Royal Botanic Garden in Edinburgh for a series of shows from August 3 to 26 during the Fringe.

Speaking at the city\u0026rsquos Waterfront Hall, she is due to say that any such deal would go against the Good Friday Agreement, which brought peace to Northern Ireland 20 years ago after decades of conflict.  Mrs May will say that following the publication of the Government\u0026rsquos white paper agreed at Chequers, it is \u0026ldquonow for the EU to respond.  She will add: \u0026ldquoNot simply to fall back on to previous positions which have already been proven unworkable. But to evolve their position in kind.  \u0026ldquoAnd, on that basis, I look forward to resuming constructive discussions.  The EU\u0026rsquos other 27 states will have a chance to examine and respond to the white paper when its General Council of ministers meets in Brussels on Friday morning.  They will also receive an update on negotiations from the European Commission\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.  The Irish border issue is one of the most disputed parts of the Brexit negotiations.  In the event of a hard no-deal Brexit, the EU wants a backstop that would effectively create a border down the Irish Sea between the island of Ireland and Great Britain, something Mrs May has repeatedly opposed.  The UK Government insists that any backstop position should include the UK as a whole.          I enjoyed meeting @MichelBarnier , discussing the progress we have made, and the outstanding issues to resolve across the Withdrawal Agreement and the Future Framework. I\u0026rsquom looking forward to stepping up the pace and energy in our negotiations. https://t.co/7v0D91sS8I          \u0026mdash Dominic Raab (@DominicRaab) July 19, 2018  Her speech comes the day after new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab headed to Brussels for the first time to take part in talks with Mr Barnier.  Mr Barnier told reporters on Thursday that it was \u0026ldquoa matter of urgency to agree a legally operative backstop, saying: \u0026ldquoWe need an all-weather insurance policy.  Mr Raab said that he was looking forward \u0026ldquowith renewed energy, vigour and vim to seeing the detail of the White Paper hammered out after a gruelling Cabinet conclave at Chequers.  Brexiteer Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom put some pressure on Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan, saying the EU must be told the Chequers blueprint, which has divided the Conservative party, is the \u0026ldquofinal offer rather than an opening gambit.  However she also admitted quitting without an agreement would not be an \u0026ldquooptimal solution.  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, meanwhile, insisted the deal is \u0026ldquoabsolutely alive despite the Government being forced to make concessions to Brexiteers.  Mrs May will again refuse to countenance any backstop that creates a divide between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.  \u0026ldquoThe economic and constitutional dislocation of a formal \u0026lsquothird country\u0026rsquo customs border within our own country is something I will never accept and I believe no British prime minister could ever accept.  \u0026ldquoAnd as they made clear this week, it is not something the House of Commons will accept either.  As the EU warns member states to increase preparations for no deal, the Prime Minister is also due to insist that an agreement can be reached with Brussels \u0026ldquothat works in our mutual interest.  She will say the deal will put the UK on the way to \u0026ldquoa prosperous future, protecting jobs and boosting prosperity at the same time as honouring the 2016 referendum result, adding: \u0026ldquoI am passionate about that brighter future and the possibilities that are within our grasp.  Amid the ongoing power-sharing impasse at Stormont, Mrs May is meeting the five main political parties on her two day visit to Northern Ireland, which included her first visit to the Irish border since the Brexit referendum.  She held talks with her Westminster confidence and supply partners, the DUP, on Thursday evening, an engagement that included a private dinner with leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds in Co Fermanagh.  Mrs May also held talks with an SDLP delegation.  On Friday morning she will meet Sinn Fein, the Ulster Unionists and Alliance Party.  Ahead of the meeting on the outskirts of Belfast, Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald heavily criticised Mrs May\u0026rsquos handling of the Brexit process.  \u0026ldquoThe British government\u0026rsquos Brexit chaos has been marked by prevarication and stalling, ever changing positions and broken agreements, she said.  \u0026ldquoThis situation is intolerable and unacceptable.  Victims of the Northern Ireland Troubles angered at a lack of progress in implementing new mechanisms to deal with the legacy of the conflict are due to protest against Mrs May\u0026rsquos visit to Belfast."},{"url":null,"title":"sir-david-attenborough-watching-butterflies-offers-precious-breathing-space","story":"  While the UK\u0026rsquos butterflies are basking in the best summer conditions in more than a decade, if the hot weather becomes a drought it could be \u0026ldquocatastrophic for the insects as plants wither and caterpillars starve.  The public are being encouraged to take part in the Big Butterfly Count over the next three weeks to help experts see how butterflies are faring and to enjoy the mental health benefits of watching wildlife.  The UK has experienced the right combination of a cold winter and a settled late spring and summer so far this year, enabling\u0026nbspspring butterflies to thrive.  The annual count could record a bumper year for species such as holly blue, common white, common blue and red admirals.  But the ongoing hot dry conditions could mean plants wither away and the next generation of caterpillars cannot find the food they need to survive.  Populations of butterflies collapsed as a result of the 1976 drought for this reason,\u0026nbsp wildlife charity Butterfly Conservation said.  The Big Butterfly Count, organised by Butterfly Conservation and sponsored by B\u0026ampQ, asks people to spot and record 17 species of common butterflies and two day-flying moths during three weeks of high summer.  Mental health charity Mind is supporting the Big Butterfly Count as a \u0026ldquowonderful way of interacting with the environment and championing the benefits of spending time in nature, which research shows can help alleviate problems such as depression and anxiety.  And Butterfly Conservation president and veteran broadcaster Sir David has spoken of the mental health benefits of spending time in nature, even at home watching garden wildlife.  \u0026ldquoI have been privileged to have witnessed some truly breath-taking wildlife spectacles in far-flung locations but some of my most memorable experiences have happened when I\u0026rsquove been simply sitting and watching the wildlife that lives where I do, he said.  \u0026ldquoA few precious moments spent watching a stunning red admiral or peacock butterfly feeding amongst the flowers in my garden never fails to bring me great pleasure.  \u0026ldquoSpending time with nature offers us all precious breathing space away from the stresses and strains of modern life, it enables us to experience joy and wonder, to slow down and to appreciate the wildlife that lives side by side with us.  Sir David also said the Big Butterfly Count, which involves spending 15 minutes in a sunny spot counting butterflies and submitting sightings online, can help gather vital information\u0026nbspthat may help protect them in the future.  More than three-quarters of the UK\u0026rsquos butterflies have declined in the last 40 years, with some common species, such as the small tortoiseshell, suffering significant slumps.  Sir David said: \u0026ldquoA cause for great concern over recent years is that many of our once common and widespread species like the large white, small copper and gatekeeper have started to struggle, mirroring the declines of rarer species.  \u0026ldquoButterfly Conservation has also revealed that butterflies are declining faster in our towns and cities than in the countryside.  \u0026ldquoSo please take part in the Big Butterfly Count this summer, we need to know, now, more than ever before, just what is happening to butterflies in our towns, in our gardens and in our countryside."},{"url":null,"title":"appearance-related-stress-rockets-among-young-women-survey-reveals","story":"  More than four in 10 women (42%) aged 16 to 24 have experienced stress related to their appearance this year, up from 26% in 2016, according to a report by analysts Mintel.  Hera Crossan, research analyst at Mintel, said: \u0026ldquoThe constant exposure to unrealistic ideals of beauty is having a strong impact on young women, who increasingly report their physical appearance as a factor of stress and discontent.  \u0026ldquoIt is likely that social media and reality TV shows such as Love Island have helped cultivate an unhealthy obsession with appearance perfection that women feel the need to live up to.  Overall, 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds have experienced stress in the last year compared with 77% of over-55s.  But while stress levels peak among younger consumers, just 4% did nothing to tackle the problem, compared with 23% of over-55s.  The top three sources of stress for Britons are money (41%), work (32%) and physical health problems (25%), the poll found.  Ms Crossan said: \u0026ldquoOver-55s may be less likely to report experiencing stress in the last year than Britain\u0026rsquos youngest adults, and indeed have fewer contributory factors, but the proportion who have been impacted by any stress is still high.  \u0026ldquoWhile cultural changes have meant that under-25s are much more open to talking about their mental health, older consumers are still much more likely to \u0026lsquobottle it up\u0026rsquo, and deal with the problem alone.  She added: \u0026ldquoGrowing financial pressure on the side of the NHS and the continued consumer-driven stigma surrounding the practice have meant that Brits are not getting the mental healthcare they need.  \u0026ldquoVery few adults who experienced stress in the last year spoke to a professional, suggesting that reduced access to medical services could be a hindrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, an increase in app-based support and therapy via video conference could help fill the gap in mental healthcare.

The budget retailer is also closing its warehouse and distribution network, the Press Association understands, alongside its head office in Normanton, West Yorkshire, leading to the loss of 300 jobs.  Administrators have announced the closure of 145 Poundworld stores already.  Poundworld fell into administration on June 11, putting more than 5,100 jobs at risk across its 335-store portfolio.  Deloitte has been announcing tranches of store closures over the past two weeks after failing to find a buyer for the whole business.  Clare Boardman, joint administrator at Deloitte, said: \u0026ldquoWe would like to thank all the employees for their continued support and commitment during this difficult time. We are keeping staff appraised of developments as they happen.  The administrators are still in talks with some interested parties about selling parts of the remaining business, but hopes of saving a significant number of jobs has faded.  Deloitte has turned down a bid from company founder Chris Edwards, who was looking to save a raft of stores and safeguard around 3,000 jobs.  The founder of rival Poundland, Steven Smith, has also been linked to a bid to salvage part of Poundworld out of administration.  The collapse came amid decreasing footfall, rising costs and weak consumer confidence.  The budget retail chain,\u0026nbspformerly owned by TPG Capital, is\u0026nbspone of a number of retailers to call in administrators this year, with Toys R Us and Maplin disappearing from UK high streets.

The UK would be free to set its own controls on immigration by EU nationals.  \u0026ndash Delays to cross-Channel freight due to new customs, sanitary and phytosanitary checks could hit supplies of food and other goods. Britain could opt to waive checks to help keep traffic moving, but this may not be matched by the EU.  \u0026ndash Without a trade deal for goods, the UK would have to fall back on World Trade Organisation rules, which require tariffs on products ranging from\u0026nbsp4% on liquefied natural gas to 9.8% on cars and 32% on wine. Britain would trade with the EU under the WTO\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquomost favoured nation status, preventing either side from imposing punitive tariffs, but the move away from frictionless zero-tariff trade is certain to drive up prices in the shops.  \u0026ndash Britain would be free to sign new free trade deals with countries around the world, and negotiations would get under way in earnest with states like the US and Australia. But these talks could last years, and in the meantime, the UK would lose access to free trade deals the EU has struck with dozens of countries, including Japan, Canada and South Korea.  \u0026ndash Opponents of a no-deal Brexit warn that major manufacturers in sectors like automotive, aerospace and pharmaceuticals would shift operations from the UK into the remaining 27 EU states in order to avoid delays and disruption to products and components crossing the border.  \u0026ndash Financial institutions in the City of London and other centres around the UK would lose their \u0026ldquopassporting rights to operate in EU countries, and could activate contingency plans to move some or all of their operations overseas.  \u0026ndash The UK\u0026rsquos annual contributions of around \u0026pound13 billion to EU budgets would cease, providing an instant windfall to the Government. But there would be pressure on ministers to make up the loss of Common Agricultural Policy subsidies totalling \u0026pound3 billion to farmers, as well as EU support for science and disadvantaged regions.  \u0026ndash New arrangements would have to be made to certify UK aviation for safety in order to ensure that planes are not grounded.  \u0026ndash Britain\u0026rsquos agreement to pay a \u0026ldquodivorce bill of up to \u0026pound39 billion would be void, and a House of Lords report has suggested that the money would no longer be payable. But some legal experts believe the EU could take the UK to the International Court of Justice to recoup the cash, which represents payments to which Britain committed itself while a member.  \u0026ndash Britain would no longer be bound by the rulings of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. But it would continue to be subject to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which is not an EU body.  \u0026ndash Professionals may find that qualifications obtained in the UK are no longer recognised in EU states, and may have to obtain new authorisations in order to continue to practise.  \u0026ndash Individuals and businesses could lose the right to apply for EU grants or tender for work with EU institutions.  \u0026ndash The status of the 300-mile Northern Irish border with the Republic would be unresolved. Both Britain and Dublin have said they will not put physical infrastructure on the border. But the Republic would come under intense pressure from Brussels to exert customs and immigration controls on what would become a new external frontier for the EU."},{"url":null,"title":"david-walliams-guest-edits-beano-for-comics-80th-birthday","story":"  The actor and children\u0026rsquos author has also created a new character, Moe, loosely based on his son Alfred, for the special edition.

Walliams, 46, will feature as himself alongside Beano favourites such as the Bash Street Kids and characters from his World\u0026rsquos Worst Children books.

In his editor\u0026rsquos letter, Walliams said: \u0026ldquoWhat I always loved about the Beano was that it felt naughty. It was a comic that you should read under the duvet with a torchlight.

Little Britain star Walliams will appear on the cover of the 44-page special edition in Beano form, with favourites including Dennis and Gnasher, Minnie the Minx, and his own dog, Bert.

Named as Fishing News 2017 ‘Port of the Year’ Peterhead Port handled a record £195million worth of fish during 2017. The port is currently undergoing a £51 million investment and opened the UK’s biggest fish market in June, landing a huge sale of 5,990 boxes on opening day.

The Council worked with the harbour to support its bid and roads and transportation teams are continuing to provide logistical support as necessary to both Fraserburgh and Peterhead ports.

The battery capacity is the equivalent of more than 128,000 iPhones.As the wind isn’t always blowing, energy storage technologies like batteries are expected to become increasingly important to secure grid stability as renewable energy becomes ever more significant.And in agriculture, the council’s Garioch Area Committee recently approved planning permission for an expansion of Thainstone Mart, supporting an application designed to assist the local industry’s long term future.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116574.jpg","title":"High calibre medical staff recruited in Caithness","story":"\u0026nbspNHS Highland yesterday confirmed the full and part-time appointments, which include two advanced nurse practitioners and a physiotherapist.Bill Fernie, chairman of Caithness Health Action Team, said: \u0026ldquoIt is definitely good news that the posts which were empty for a long time are being filled and that is welcomed by us.\u0026ldquoThis is a success for NHS Highland but it has been a long time coming. They still have some way to go with other vacant posts but it is good to see GPs being recruited.\u0026ldquoHaving locums all the time means patients don\u0026rsquot see the same person, but with GPs you have a better chance of continuity.Dr David Carson and Dr Mike Ruse are set to join advanced nurse practitioner (ANP) Colin Armer \u0026ndash a recent recruit \u0026ndash at the Riverbank Medical Practice in Thurso.Dr Herjit Sutherland is to join the Riverview Medical Practice in Wick along with new ANP appointment Vicki Kelly.Mike Flavell, who is giving up his post as NHS Highland\u0026rsquos Caithness district manager, is an advanced physiotherapist and is to begin weekly clinics shortly in the Riverbank and Riverview practices as well as in the Lybster medical practice. He will leave his present post in September, although he will be replaced.Mr Flavell thinks his clinics will provide a number of benefits for patients and practices alike.He said: \u0026ldquoTwenty-five per cent of appointments at GP practices are for muscular skeletal problems. So, in theory, my physiotherapy clinics could help to take 25 per cent off the GP\u0026rsquos workload.\u0026ldquoAnd for people aged over 75, that figure goes up to 38 per cent, so I may be able to provide even more support.Kath Jones, NHS Highland\u0026rsquos associate medical director north and west, said: \u0026ldquoThree Caithness GP practices run by NHS Highland have recently attracted six new clinicians to permanent posts including three GPs, two ANPs and a physio practitioner.\u0026ldquoThe appointment of so many high-calibre clinicians within such a short time is a credit to the quality of the teams working in these practices. The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care. With two of the clinicians moving into the district to take up post, this will be good for the local economy too.Mr Armer has already taken up his post at the practice on Janet Street, Thurso. Dr Carson is due to start in August and Dr Ruse in October.Vicki Kelly is to start her post at the Martha Terrace practice in Wick next week with Herjit Sutherland due to begin work at the end of August.Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This includes security and airfield operations, airside services, firefighters, operations officers and passenger service agents.“Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members,\u0026#8221 said Unite regional officer Wullie Wallace.\u0026#8220The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard-working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.“Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities.

We created the FitHomes concept to help Highland residents take charge of their own wellbeing and health needs through innovative technology and design.\"Thanks to the support we\u0026rsquove had from Centrica, both financially and advisory, we will be able to deliver digital health and assisted living technologies in a way that has not been possible before.\"The investment has been made by Centrica\u0026rsquos Ignite social impact investment fund. Established in 2017, Centrica Innovations aims to invest \u0026pound100 million by 2022 in new technologies that will transform the way people live, work and move.Sam Salisbury, Centrica Innovations labs director, said: \"As a market leader in connected home products, we are always on the lookout for opportunities to solve real world problems with new technology and innovation. The lack of affordable, energy efficient, desirable homes is one that is affecting families across the country so we\u0026rsquore delighted to be able to support an initiative that shows such potential in transforming how people, young and old, live in their homes.\"The origins of the FitHome go back to 2008 when a tenant was found dead in his home, having lain unnoticed for over a year. Vowing to put new preventative systems in place, Albyn commissioned research exploring potential solutions. As a result, the society decided to develop its own system that could be adopted across its growing portfolio of homes.Matt Stevenson of Carbon Dynamic said of FitHomes: \"I truly believe that this housing method can change the way that we view construction of new housing developments as well as feeding into the wider healthcare and societal issues.\"Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am. And Dingwall No.1 in Craig Road will be shut from 7am on August 2 to 11am on August 5.Final installation and testing of the new barriers will also require fortnight-long road closures at both sites \u0026ndash Dingwall Middle from October 15 to 29 and Dingwall No.1 from October 29 to November 12.David Dickson, infrastructure director for Network Rail Scotland, said: \"These level crossing upgrades represent a significant improvement for rail and road safety.\"Our consultation work with the local community earlier this year indicated support for these improvements and we look forward to seeing them delivered.\"Our aim is to deliver this work with as little disruption as possible, however, we will require two short closures this summer plus two week road closures for each crossing to install and test the new equipment this autumn.\"Train services are not expected to be affected by any of the works.Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Visitors will then be able to access behind the scenes areas of the museum, experiencing objects up close.Curator Dr Karen Buchanan explained: \"We want to make as much of the material in our collections accessible as possible. This includes not only our objects in storage, but also the wealth of archive and library material we hold, which document the history of Gairloch parish. This funding will maximise our storage space, protect our collection for the future and enrich our visitors\u0026rsquo experiences.\"Museums Galleries Scotland is the National Development Body for museums and galleries in Scotland and offers strategic development support to the sector. This round of funding saw over \u0026pound550,000 awarded to 15 different projects in 14 museums across Scotland.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known.

Depute fiscal Alison McKenzie told Sheriff Margaret Neilson the 15-year-old was being trained in lifeguard skills and it was when they were alone at the pool Russell repeatedly fondled him over his trunks: \"It happened so frequently he could not recall the number of occasions he was molested,\" said the fiscal.The boy didn\u0026rsquot report the assaults and told no-one until many years later as a father of two he received a letter from Russell offering to act as a football scout for his children.The fiscal said: \"The complainer was furious, recalled the abuse he suffered at the hands of the accused, and made a statement of complaint to police.\"Russell admitted assaulting the boy on various dates between 1977 and 1979 at Dingwall Sports Centre Swimming Pool and between May and June 1981 at the Mackay Hostel sexually assaulting a 16-year-old.He further admitted assaulting an 18-year-old by handling his buttocks over his kilt in 1983 at a street in Dingwall and exposing himself to him.He also pleaded guilty to indecently assaulting an 18- year-old at the hostel in 1984 by sitting on his bed uninvited, placing his hand under the bed covers and repeatedly attempting to touch his genitals.Sentence was deferred after his last appearance for reports.Russell is due to appear in court again on August 2.Friday 20 Jul 2018 3:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

In more recent times, it has seen the fairytale rise of Ross County from Highland League to Premiership \u0026ndash and a notorious Town Hall appearance by the Beatles when the Fab Four were on the brink of global success.Now, history hunters are being targeted by DCDC which has sought to work with the public to create a new vision of the town.Fascinating facts are being assembled by Dingwall History Society for panels dotting the town and shining light on its rich past.Secretary\u0026nbspSandra MacDonald said: \"Dingwall has a very long and significant history and we have the information available.\"The group will gather facts and suggest significant sites worthy of interpretation but will not have the final say.Mrs MacDonald, whose late husband David \"DD\" MacDonald chaired the society for a decade, said: \"There are the obvious sites like the Tollbooth \u0026ndash the tower and the clock.\"Other sites being considered include the war memorials at Station Square and the Hector Macdonald Monument and Moot Hill in the Cromartie Memorial car park, where the Vikings are believed to have held gatherings.Mrs MacDonald added: \"A board can carry a minimum amount of information but can indicate where people can access far more online.\"DCDC secretary Robin Lingard revealed the heritage trail is one of several items being proposed by the group, set up as a charity two years ago to tap funding pots for improvements. He told a recent open meeting that membership had more than doubled. \"We are very pleased,\" he said. \"I think out of it new ideas will come forward.\"Community activist George Murray, project manager for Dingwall Means Business, targeting the establishment of a business improvement district (BID), said: \"I think the DCDC is the perfect body to spearhead and develop plans like the heritage trail. I see it as being beneficial not only for local community development and participation but also as a way of presenting our community heritage to the world, especially as we get busier with the advent of the cruise tour coaches beginning to discover the town and the success of the NC500 route.\"If suitable funding can be put in place a heritage trail round the area could be a real boon to the town.\"Dingwall councillor Angela MacLean said a trail is \"a fantastic opportunity\" to showcase the town.She said: \"Many of the DCDC group\u0026rsquos wish list buildings are in the ownership of the Highland Council and if DCDC or another local group would like to take over and run of any of these buildings I am more than happy to lend my support. I would also like to congratulate DCDC for the work they have done so far and look forward to working with them to make some of their proposals a reality over the coming years.\"\u0026bull What do you think about the idea?

The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre (OGTC) is leading the industry-backed “Facility of the Future” initiative that could halve the cost of developing and operating an oil and gas facility and help to access the equivalent of more than 3.5 billion barrels of reserves in so-called marginal discoveries.            A discovery is classed as marginal when the risks or technology involved make it too challenging to develop economically, for instance because of its geographical location or the specialist equipment needed.            The project wants to design a new approach that will make this process more efficient than traditional methods, such as fixed platforms.It aims to develop lower-cost, reusable facilities that can be remotely operated from onshore control centres, thereby increasing reducing the requirement for staff to work in the hazardous offshore environment and creating skilled onshore jobs. Chris Pearson, the OGTC’s small pools solution centre manager, said: “Oil and gas is playing catch-up with many industries when it comes to automation and remote operations. We’re exploring how the combination of existing and new technology can be best used in the offshore environment to improve safety, reduce life cycle cost and increase efficiency.“New, smarter and more automated ways of developing oil and gas fields are required if we’re to fully unlock marginal discoveries and maximise economic recovery from the UKCS. “The Facility of the Future initiative will help to significantly reduce life-cycle costs and strengthen the investment case for both marginal discoveries and more traditional reservoirs.”            The initiative will kick off with a study led by Crondall Energy and Buoyant Production Technologies to develop a floating facility adapted from the type of installations currently used for shallow water gas fields, known as NUIs, to make them suitable for oil discoveries. It hopes to design an NUI concept that will function at any water depth and uses a minimal manning approach by involving remote control and automation technologies.Niki Chambers, project manager at the marginal development solutions centre, said: “This study is looking at unlocking the capabilities of these floating facilities to work across any kind of discovery. It is opening up the whole of the UKCS.” The OGTC is supported by the Scottish and UK governments, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire councils and Opportunity North East. It also generates funding from industry and university partners, and is currently in the process of securing further funds for subsequent studies as part of this initiative."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771566.1532079790!/image/image.jpg","title":"almost 200 drivers caught in drink drive crackdown","story":"        A two-week drink-driving crackdown saw 195 motorists caught under the influence.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771365.1532074989!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment mps are nothing without honour","story":"        Pressure caused by Brexit is showing alarming signs of damaging our democratic process.                The pressure exerted by Brexit on our politicians has been considerable.             Since the Chequers plan was announced, there has been talk that Theresa May will face a leadership challenge, that a snap general election is on the cards, and even that parties could split and reform along new political lines. And the stakes could hardly be higher with the country apparently on course for a no-deal Brexit which could wreck the UK economy.             But yesterday brought accusations which, if true, suggests our democratic system itself could be starting to crack under the strain.There were claims of a “calculated, deliberate breaking of trust”, calls for the resignation of the Government’s chief whip Julian Smith and the Conservative Party chairman Brandon Lewis, and a note of despair from Tory MP Heidi Alexander, who said: “No matter how tough the going gets, principle, integrity and standards matter. Without those, what’s left?”READ MORE: EU states to be warned over possible no-deal BrexitThe affair began when it emerged Lewis had taken part in a close Commons vote on Brexit, which the Government won by a few votes, even though he had agreed not to vote as part of a ‘pairing’ deal with Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, who is on maternity leave. Theresa May explained to the Commons that this had been a simple mistake, but reports have since emerged that two other Tory MPs were told to break their pairing agreements. A text to one MP from Smith was described as “an order, not a request”. However, to their credit, the two MPs both refused to comply and stuck by the pairing agreement. The reports have not been denied, but May was said to be sticking by Smith.            The SNP, among others, called for an inquiry into what happened and, if one were to be held, May would doubtless be asked whether she had given instructions to the chief whip to tell MPs to break pairing agreements or if she had tacitly agreed to such a dishonourably strategy. She would also face questions about whether she misled the House by saying there had been a mistake. But, with no evidence that the Prime Minister was actually involved, the focus for now will be on Smith and Lewis. Conservative MP Anna Soubry, a shining voice of reason in this fractious House, summed the situation up as eloquently as ever: “If true, this is appalling and those responsible must resign. If we cannot behave with honour we are nothing.”READ MORE: Theresa May steps back from the brink with narrow Brexit victory"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771777.1532093404!/image/image.jpg","title":"meet the yorkshire party the english regionalists inspired by the snp","story":"        It has a mixed economy reliant on financial services and tourism, a population of around five million, and is famous for its rugged yet beautiful landscape.                The historic English county of Yorkshire and Scotland have much in common at first glance. But when it comes to local governance, there are many who are casting envious glances north of the Border.            One group is calling for establishment of a regional assembly, similar to Holyrood, to take decisions across the region.            The Yorkshire Party was set up by “three men and a dog” in 2014, co-founder and leader Stewart Arnold told The Scotsman.Its membership is now in the hundreds and it fielded 21 candidates in last year’s snap general election, seven more than in 2015, pulling in 20,958 votes in total.While the party remains a niche concern, its core aims reflect a frustration felt in parts of England that feel remote from Wesminster.READ MORE: Devolution - but what about England?Devolution to Wales and Scotland, and the restoration of a parliament in Northern Ireland, transformed how politics worked across the UK in the late 1990s.            Tony Blair’s Labour Government did plan to create at least three English regional assemblies, but the project ground to a halt when a referendum on the matter in the north-east returned a decisive no vote in 2004.If a yes vote had been returned further plebiscites would have taken place in the north-west as well as Yorkshire and Humber.Fast forward 14 years and the Yorkshire Party believes the time is right for devolution to the regions to be seriously considered again.“The arguments for why devolution is important have not gone away,” said Arnold. “The economic crash accentuated the need for it. I think that’s when people started to realise that maybe one idea out of this was to get behind regionalism.            “The Yorkshire Party started off with various people from a cross-party point of view setting up a kind of campaign group - but then we thought of the example of the SNP and Plaid Cymru in the 1960s, and realised that to get the UK Government and the main parties to sit up and take notice you needed to hurt them at the ballot box.”The party does not advocate independence but instead campaigns for the creation of a regional assembly covering the entirety of the historic Yorkshire county - which is today carved up between numerous different local authorities.That goes beyond the the so-called ‘One Yorkshire’ model which is backed by 18 out of 20 local authorities in the region, and would lead to a directly elected mayor, similar to existing roles in Manchester and Liverpool, being voted in to power by 2020.“The city deals and one elected mayor might suit somewhere like Birmingham, but we don’t think it suits somewhere as diverse as Yorkshire,” said Arnold.“We would want as many powers as possible so we could set our priorities accordingly. We look at the Scottish Parliament as a model. Obviously, we are a long way from that, but it’s an example of what you can do.            “That’s not to say we would necessarily do everything the Scottish Government has done, but at least we could set our priorities.”The rise of the SNP has provided inspiration to the Yorkshire movement, even if its end goals are different.“One of the key things I take from the SNP is their success at the ballot box,” added Arnold. “The Hamilton by-election in 1967 made Harold Wilson and Ted Heath sit up and take up notice.“There was a long process before that, but that was the catalyst.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4771621.1532083722!/image/image.jpg","title":"teenagers question theresa may over dup deal","story":"        Prime Minster Theresa May defended her confidence and supply arrangement with the DUP after being questioned by teenagers in Belfast.

Cosla said that it supported the new licensing regime but also backed the Sottish Government’s Equally Safe campaign defined violence against women as including lap dancing and stripping as well as prostitution and human trafficking.            But sexual entertainment operators expressed concern that local authorities could pursue an effective ban in their areas.They said the legislation, which is part of the Air Weapons and Licensing (Scotland) Act, was a “threat” to livelihoods. They were also concerned that the legislation did not provide for “grandfather rights”, whereby old rules can apply to existing cases, so that venues already in operation could continue doing business."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building.

If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.

And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf.

Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed.

It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill!

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be.

A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations. Rescheduling appointments is not easy for those living in remote communities and patients may have a lengthy wait for another opportunity to travel.\n\u0026#8220The right to strike is an important one and I understand that strikes have to cause disruption in order to be effective.\n\u0026#8220But, I urge your members to carefully consider this compromise: Loganair flights from the North Isles use smaller aircraft which require a lower level of fire service cover.\n\u0026#8220Therefore, Unite members could guarantee a minimum level of fire and security coverage on the proposed strike dates, allowing life-line Orkney and Shetland flights to continue for essential medical travel.\n\u0026#8220I hope further discussions will resolve the dispute before any strike action goes ahead and that the needs of North Isles passengers are at the forefront of your decision making.\u0026#8221\nMeanwhile, Loganair is giving passengers in Shetland the chance to change their flights.\nAbout 170 members, including key airport staff, security workers and firefighters have voted in favour of striking – with more talks expected next week involving conciliation service Acas.\nTwenty-four-hour strikes are planned for Friday 20th July as well as on Thursday 2nd August and Thursday16th August.\nLoganair managing director Jonathan Hinkles said passengers could change their flights free of charge.\nHe said: “Although there is still time for the strike to be averted and we hope it will be, we are offering customers booked to fly to or from Aberdeen on the strike dates the opportunity to change their travel date or route if they wish.\n\u0026#8220This is free of charge and designed to offer certainty of alternatives for those booked to travel.\n\u0026#8220We also have contingency plans to operate Aberdeen flights to alternate airports on strike days if this does go ahead, and will announce details of those if this action cannot be averted. Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers. A total of 88 per cent of workers rejected the latest pay offer.\nThe union said members had rejected two below-inflation wage offers on the back of below inflation increases over the last two years.\nMr Wallace said: \u0026#8220Aberdeen International Airport’s latest derisory pay offer has been emphatically rejected by Unite members. The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney. It is reasonable to suspect that the SNP is in the unions’ pockets.\nI can only suggest that if Christopher wants to find out who is in the ‘unions pockets’ he should investigate the connection between the Labour Party and Unite,  and while he’s at it perhaps he should refresh his memory as to what powers are reserved at Westminster and which are devolved to Holyrood.\nThere are so many reds under beds these days \u0026#8230\n My primary concern is that Shetland and Orkney folk will be at risk for a number of August days while this irresponsible union strikes. Perhaps the collective Governments will make a Coast Guard helicopter available.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brae pool closure extended ","story":"The closure of the Brae swimming pool is to continue until the end of September.\nOriginally, the North Mainland Leisure Centre had been due to re-open this month once repairs were completed to the roof.\nBut due to a delay in the procurement process work is only set to begin next week, with late September now the target for re-opening.\nLocal firm DITT Construction have been appointed to repair the damage suffered during a winter storm last week.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of

conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 20 Jul 2018 3:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27412  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe leaders of the political parties in the North have united to condemn violence which has erupted in several areas across the north in recent days. \nThe leaders of the six main parties, Sinn Féin, DUP, SDLP, UUP, Alliance, and Greens issued a joint statement appealing for calm. \nThe move comes after several nights of disorder in Derry\u0027s Bogside area, during which shots were fired and homes attacked with petrol bombs, as well as incidents in Belfast including sectarian attacks on homes and intimidation of contractors removing loyalist bonfires. \nThe political leaders said there can be no place for such activities and called for them to end immediately. \n“Attacks on the police have been on-going for a number of days alongside other violence including sectarian attacks on houses, petrol bombs thrown at the police, intimidation of contractors, vehicles hi-jacked and attacks on sheltered accommodation.\n“The shots fired last night were a clear and obvious attempt to murder police officers.

Michael McMonagle\n\nWhat we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry.\nThe people of Derry will take to the streets tonight to challenge what Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has described as the \"warped, negative, regressive , and dangerous\" agenda of those behind the disturbances that have occurred in the city\u0027s Bogside area in recent nights. \nA rally in solidarity with the local community will be held in the city tonight at 7pm, supported by a range of parties and organisations, at Fahan Street/Butcher Gate. \nIt follows several nights of disturbances in the area which included a gun attack on PSNI officers, several blast bombs and dozens of petrol bombs. \nSome of those involved in the disturbances have been young children. \nThe Sinn Féin leader encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s rally to show solidarity with the people of the Bogside and Fountain and to send a clear message that there is no support for the violence witnessed over the last week. \nMary Lou McDonald made the comments in the Bogside this afternoon alongside Sinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill as they met with local residents and community leaders and ahead of a meeting with PSNI Chief Constable, George Hamilton, to discuss the violence. \n\nSpeaking to the media at the Gasyard Centre in the Bogside, Mary Lou McDonald said those behind the violence had a \"warped agenda\" and \"cynical, calculated manipulation of young people.\" \n\"What we have witnessed here is a sustained and a calculated attack on the community of the Bogside, spilling into the Fountain and the whole of the city of Derry,\" she said. \n\"What we have seen here is a deliberate strategy by those who would style themselves as dissidents to misuse, mislead and manipulate children and to cause fear, hardship and anger across this community. \n\"But they have also created a sense of determination, Because this is Derry and because the Bogside is the Bogside and the people here aren\u0027t having it. This is the city of Martin McGuinness, of John Hume, of civil rights, this is the maiden city, these are proud communities and this evening the people of the Bogside and beyond will come on to the street and stand shoulder to shoulder to face the thuggery, the criminality, the manipulation and the warped thinking of a small, small minority of people who would wish to cause damage here,\" the Sinn Féin leader added. \nMary Lou McDonald also said the local community are angry and that what has happened is not a reflection of the vast majority of local people. \n\"This is every reflection on warped, negative, regressive , dangerous people who think it is OK to manipulate young people and young children to throw petrol bombs and the like for an agenda that is nothing but a road to absolutely nowhere bar anger, fear and destruction,\" she explained. \nThe Sinn Féin President also said the PSNI have a responsibility to keep people safe but laid the blame for the disturbances squarely on dissident groupings. \n\"There is a sense in the community that the police need to do more, that there needs to be a more effective engagement but let me be clear about this, we will talk to George Hamilton about all of those things but be clear here who the instigator of this hardship is, let\u0027s be clear on that. That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted. This was subsequently delivered in a letter to the Belfast Headquarters of BBC and RTÉ. \nSinéad Ennis said she will be meeting with RTÉ’s new Head of Sport in the coming days and has called on them to “put measures in place” to end the disenfranchisement of sports fans in the north.”\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27417  ","story":"Declan Kearney addressing The Ard Fheis.\n Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nMutual respect and parity of esteem apply equally to our shared Orange and Gaelic cultures, unionist and Republican traditions, and British and Irish identities. - Declan Kearney\nEnsuring that facts should not get in the way of repeating misrepresentationswas a thought which struck forcefully when I read Nelson McCausland’s recentarticle on Orange culture.\nNelson repeated his view that Sinn Féin is prejudiced against the Orange Order,and again ridiculed our commitment to equality, respect and reconciliation.\nHe deliberately and falsely characterised the actions and words of myself andother Sinn Féin leaders.\nThe fact is Orange culture is an integral part of Irish society.

Incidentally, both of those claims were the highest in the 40-member chamber.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a02f.jpg","title":"65207  ","story":"    \nTHE Department of Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs believes that the recent sustained spell of hot weather - rather than pollution - has led to the deaths of a number of fish in a section of the Dunore River near Antrim.\nLocal man, James Cousley - who has lived on the Drennans Road\u0026#160 for more than 70 years - was distressed when he discovered the fish in the river, which runs alongside his property.\n\u0026#8220That river has been polluted before, less than two years ago, he said.\nBut after two visits by officials, DAERA was able to confirm that pollution had not caused the fish to die on this occasion.\nA\u0026#160 spokesperson said: The recent warm weather has led to high water temperatures in conjunction with lower base river flows in many waterways and this can have an adverse impact on the fishery and river ecology. \n\u0026#8220It is not unusual for dissolved oxygen levels to drop to critically low levels, particularly at night, which can result in fish mortalities.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren - including young children - made their way down Station Road, watched by spectators, they were unaware of a more sinister set of eyes trained upon them.\nVideo footage, which has spread on social media, shows a man in a beret and camouflage jacket with his face obscured by a scarf and sunglasses, raising what looks like an assault rifle before training it on those marching.\nWatching from a house on the route, he is being filmed as he appears to cock the rifle.\nAs the camera pans back towards the parade going past the house, he points the weapon in its direction before a disturbing \u0027click\u0027 - believed to be the trigger being pulled - can be heard off-camera.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a06f1.jpg","title":"65301  ","story":"    \nMUCKAMORE Seconds have reached the Ulster Plate final against Ardmore Seconds or Donemana Seconds on August 19.\nAnd the club\u0027s First XI gained more valuable points when they travelled to Stormont on Saturday to play CSNI in their latest Premier League match and completed the double over their arch-rivals in a vitally important game. \nThe fixture marked the debut of new signing Adam McDaid, who has joined this week from North West Club, Eglinton. \nThis weekend Muckamore travel to Armagh seeking a win against the bottom team, which would almost certainly secure the Antrim club\u0027s position in the Premier League next season.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f1.jpg","title":"65302  ","story":"    \nANOTHER break between rugby seasons draws to an end this week as Randalstown Rugby Club\u0027s pre-season training begins.\nAfter a 10-week period in which the senior squad had the opportunity to get some excellent strength and conditioning work completed at Ballymena Academy under the guidance of Ryan Keating, the players now return to the pitch.\nThis season, Randalstown will field three senior sides in the Ulster Branch leagues with the First XV in Qualifying League 2, the Second XV in Junior League 3 and the Third XV in Junior League 6.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a04f.jpg","title":"65303  ","story":"    \nTHE Opening Ceremony for the Atlantic Challenge International Contest of Seamanship will take place in Antrim this weekend.\nTwo hundred young people representing USA, Russia, Belgium, Great Britain, Republic of Ireland, France, Denmark, Canada and Northern Ireland will compete, live and learn together in the town as part of the Atlantic Challenge. \nDuring the week-long contest, 38-foot wooden gigs will be sailed and rowed on Lough Neagh.

She was devoted to the needs of the less fortunate in Romania.  Both her and Samuel travelled many times to Romania thus allowing Barbara to speak passionately at home in Northern Ireland at many events and meetings. At the same time Barbara was busy fundraising, filling and organising containers to be transported out to Romania with all kinds of essential supplies and gifts and was still finding time to help Samuel on their farm.\n\nBarbara inspired many others in the community to travel out to Romania to help the people there in any way they could and see for themselves the need that Barbara so passionately spoke of back home.\n\nBarbara was a people’s person and this was certainly borne out by the large attendance at her funeral at Toberdoney Presbyterian Church last Monday and all those who paid their fitting tributes having travelled from near and far.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nBarbara’s passing has left a huge void for her husband Samuel, her father Jim, brother Robin and sister Alison, nephews, nieces, wider family and all who knew her. She was predeceased by her mother Grace.\n\nThe charity ‘Smiles’ has also paid tribute to Barbara on its website.\n\nIt said the Smiles Family is now one less, adding: “It is hard to imagine life or Smiles without her’ but we thank God for the amazing legacy of achievement that Barbara leaves, for what she meant to so many and look forward to continuing the work in Romania which Barbara so passionately loved and supported.”\n\nThoughts and prayers go out to Samuel and the family circle.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n    try { _402_Show() } catch(e) {}    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8571942.1531923675!/image/image.jpg","title":"children s charity to benefit from ni open","story":"\nThe Northern Ireland Open, which takes place at Galgorm Castle from August 15-19, has selected Cancer Fund for Children as its official charity partner for 2018.\n\n                \nThe local charity will benefit from the tournament next month, which will see 156 European Tour golfers take to the course, as well as an extensive schedule of events and activities away from the fairways to entertain all the family.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAs well as selling the official programme for the NI Open, the charity will benefit from a range of events including an Ambassadors Q\u0026ampA Evening on August 14 in the Braid, and the Pro Am Dinner, following the Pro Am Day on August 15.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFunds raised from the tournament will enable Cancer Fund for Children to provide a range of practical, emotional and financial support to families affected by cancer, to help them cope with its impact on their lives.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Taylor family from Ahoghill are just one local family who have benefitted from the charity’s support, after their 12-year-old daughter Molly was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.\n\nMum Lisa said: “When Molly was diagnosed with cancer, it was a massive shock.
