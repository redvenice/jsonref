But this gap increases to 40 per cent when comparing men to women who have left the workplace to care for children for a period of time.Last year, Which? analysis found there are already significant gender disparities within state pension benefits. This is because the average man receives £153.86 a week compared to £125.98 for the average woman – which adds up to almost £29,000 over the course of a 20-year retirement.         The money would make up for some of the income and related pension contributions they lose while caring for young childrenWhich? suggested that each household should be able to choose which parent or guardian’s pension scheme would get the £2,000 contribution. In the event no scheme is nominated, the contribution would be made to an account with NEST, the auto-enrolment pension scheme set up by the Government.The consumer group also believes further reform to the workplace pension scheme is needed to ensure an adequate income in retirement.Automatic enrolment has drawn in more than ten million new savers since 2012, yet research shows the minimum saving rate – 8 per cent of income – is too low to provide an adequate income for many earners. With the current minimum contribution, a middle-income earner might expect to save £114,000, but combined with their state pension this might only add up to £13,500 a year – not be enough for a comfortable retirement.As a result, Which? is also recommending the Government raise the minimum pension contribution to at least 12 per cent for middle-income earners.However, it proposes the default contribution remains for lower-income earners to avoid over-saving and financial hardship.Jenny Ross, of Which? Money, said the ‘motherhood penalty’ threatens ‘to leave those who choose to work reduced hours due to childcare responsibilities significantly worse off in retirement’.‘If the Government is committed to pension equality it should introduce a £2,000 pension contribution for first-time mothers, and also raise the minimum contribution rate for all middle-income earners.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Coffee health issues myth new study reveals drink 25 cups DAY","story":"Share this article The research, which was part-funded by the British Heart Foundation, is being presented at the British Cardiovascular Society Conference in Manchester.Experts from Queen Mary University of London ided 8,412 participants into three groups for their study.The first group was made up of participants who drink less than one cup of coffee a day, the second contained those who drink between one and three cups a day, and the third was made up of people who drink more than three.Some people drank up to 25 cups a day in the latter group – but the average was five cups a day.Researchers found even those drinking the higher daily amounts were no more likely to have stiffening of arteries than those who drank less than one cup a day.          More than 8,000 people took part in the study which was part-funded by the British Heart FoundationPrevious studies have suggested that coffee stiffens arteries, putting pressure on the heart and increasing the likelihood of a heart attack or stroke.All the participants had heart scans and infrared pulse wave tests, and researchers found the results held true after factors such as age, weight and smoking status were taken into account.Dr Kenneth Fung, from Queen Mary University of London, said: \u0027Despite the huge popularity of coffee worldwide, different reports could put people off enjoying it.\u0027While we can\u0027t prove a causal link in this study, our research indicates coffee isn\u0027t as bad for the arteries as previous studies would suggest.\u0027 He highlighted that while some participants drank huge amounts of coffee, the average among the highest consumer group was five cups a day.He added: \u0027We would like to study these people more closely in our future work so that we can help to advise safe limits.\u0027Professor Metin Avkiran, associate medical director at the BHF, said the study \u0027rules out one of the potential detrimental effects of coffee on our arteries\u0027.Another study presented at the conference found people admitted to NHS hospitals over the weekend with cardiac arrest did not face a higher risk of dying than those admitted during the week.The study, led by experts at Aston University in Birmingham, included 4,803 people going to hospital with a cardiac arrest and assessed their five-year survival."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/11/4DF8936700000578-0-image-m-8_1530871502899.jpg","title":"Im just not interested ewe One 12 sheep gay experts reveal","story":"Share this articleC4’s My Gay Dog And Other Animals reveals one in 12 sheep are GAY ‘causing problems for farmers’ – The Sun"},{"url":null,"title":"Online retail giant Amazon set open ten temporary bricks mortar UK","story":"Share this article Politicians and business leaders have become increasingly critical of Amazon in recent years, claiming it steals customers away from town centres. But the online retailer said it wanted to support ‘small businesses, helping them boost the economy and create jobs across the UK’."},{"url":null,"title":"Climbers vanished ascent Indias second highest peak pictured base camp","story":"Share this articleAustralian woman confirmed to be among group missing in India\u0027s Himalayas after avalanche - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)Four Britons among eight climbers missing in Himalayas after deadly season | World News | Sky News"},{"url":null,"title":"Older women punctual work men 20s 30s trusted turn time","story":"Share this article It found that 99 per cent of women of the baby boomer generation – aged between 55 and 75 – started their work shifts on time on every working day between March 2018 and March this year. By contrast, 76 per cent of men in their twenties and thirties were late at least once.The greater punctuality of older workers may help explain the increasing success of those beyond traditional retirement age in holding down jobs.

A spokesman for  the Minister said that “overall” her department did not expect to see an increase in “average” school-age childcare fees. Photograph: Eric LukeAftercare costs for school children are set to climb by up to 40 per cent for many upper- and middle-income parents, childcare providers have warned.New regulations due to come into force ahead of the new school year mean school-age childcare providers will be obliged to have one adult for every 12 children on their premises.A number of aftercare providers say they will need to hire additional staff and costs will rise by up to 40 per cent as a result. Other providers say they will need to reduce the number of places on offer in order to continue to operate.The new rules relate to aftercare operators who are participating in the State’s new national childcare scheme. This provides income-based subsidies to parents who are availing of aftercare for school-aged children.Under the scheme, parents with a net income of less than €60,000 per year are are entitled to means-tested subsidies of up to €145 per week per child.Reckonable income is calculated by taking net family income and deducting allowable costs such as discounts for multiple children, pension contributions and certain social welfare payments.While those on low to middle incomes will in most cases see a reduction in costs, families with middle to higher incomes will in many cases face higher costs because they are not entitled to subsidies.A spokesman for Minister Children and Youth Affairs Katharine Zappone said that “overall” it did not expect to see an increase in “average” school-age childcare fees.“Already over 80,000 children are receiving extra supports,” the spokesman said. “This includes 40,000 children on targeted supports of up to €145 per child per week up to the age of 15. All of Minister Zappone’s actions are to bring even more benefits to more families.”Independent expertsHe said the new 12:1 ratio was recommended by independent experts, including representatives of providers.He said a public consultation was under way and anyone facing difficulties with access or fees “should use it as an opportunity to speak up”.Some after-school providers for vulnerable children have warned they face potential closure on the basis that parents who are not working will no longer be entitled to the same level of targeted financial assistance.Carlow Regional Youth Services Ltd, for example, provides aftercare for up to 60 children aged eight to 11 who are at risk of not making the transition from primary to secondary. The service has warned the new rules “will close our after-school service and as a result vulnerable children will lose out”.A spokesman for Ms Zappone said that under the new scheme, low-income parents who are working or studying will qualify for an enhanced-hours subsidy, up to a maximum of 40 hours per week.Where a parent is not working or studying, the child will still be eligible for the standard hours subsidy of 15 hours per week.“This approach reflects policy objectives of encouraging labour market activation and reducing child poverty and persistent poverty traps,” the spokesman said."},{"url":null,"title":"a baby born today the climate and their future","story":"Life-support systems that nature provides – an intertwined web that sustains humans, plants and animals – are at risk of unravelling in a matter of decades.Deforestation, intensive agriculture, overfishing, development and other human activities are breaking the bonds that combine to make a healthy planet. Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3912833.1559504373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sentry boxes for gpo in dublin s o connell street revival plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe O’Connell Street Revival Society says illuminating the Spire and the O’Connell and Parnell monuments could be achieved at an annual cost of about €300,000. Photograph: Bryan O’BrienThe illumination of the Spire, the installation of public seating and the erection of sentry boxes at the GPO, have been proposed by a new civic organisation seeking to revitalise Dublin’s main thoroughfare. The group, formed by inner city residents Sinead Connolly, John Seery, Michael Duffy and Sinead O’Dwyer, has produced a report based on proposals made by members of the society and the public.The 12 Steps to Revive the Street report, which will be presented to Dublin city councillors next month, proposes the illumination of the Spire at night, which it says is “barely visible” despite being officially called the Monument of Light. “Major monuments in other European capitals have a lighting programme which attracts visitors and locals to enjoy these public spectacles.” Public seatingIlluminating the Spire and the O’Connell and Parnell monuments could be achieved at an annual cost of about €300,000, it said. Public seating could also encourage people to linger on the street, with 50 benches costing approximately €100,000.At the GPO, it proposes installing two sentry boxes, similar to those used at Buckingham Palace or the Vittorio Emanuele II monument in Rome. These could be manned by “uniformed gardaí or ceremonial soldiers” which would work “simultaneously as a tourist attraction and as a highly visible permanent and comforting security presence on the street”.Lord Mayor Nial Ring welcomed the report, which he said would “help stimulate debate on what changes are needed to bring the street forward as the social, economic and cultural heart of Dublin”.“€40 million was spent in the late 1990s and while that did improve the footpaths, and the plaza at the GPO and the Spire were put in, it didn’t change the narrative of the street. And now 25 per cent of the street is either closed down, vacant or derelict,” said Mr Seery."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3913201.1559548319!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tds to seek advice on fast tracking cervicalcheck claims tribunal","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Health Simon Harris has asked the committee members to waive the usual pre-legislative scrutiny in order to speed up the process of setting up the tribunal.  Photograph: Tom HonanThe  An Oireachtas committee is to seek legal advice about fast-tracking legislation to bring in a new tribunal to deal with claims arising from the CervicalCheck controversy. Members of the Oireachtas Committee on Health met in private last week to discuss plans to expedite the legislation but concerns were expressed that the members had not seen the details on the legislation and what it may contain, sources say. Minister for Health Simon Harris has asked the committee members to waive the usual pre-legislative scrutiny in order to speed up the process of setting up the tribunal. One TD on the committee said concerns were raised last week about the compellability of witnesses and documents and about whether appearing before the tribunal would be voluntary or not. Members of the health committee are seeking advice from the Oireachtas business committee arising from their concerns before they make a decision about fast-tracking the Bill. It comes as new figures reveal that almost 65,000 women are still waiting to receive the results of their smear tests as the Health Service Executive (HSE) continues with attempts to clear the backlog. In some cases, women are still being asked to wait longer than 33 weeks to receive the results of their smear tests. ‘Unprecedented increase’A spokeswoman for the HSE said it was “absolutely focused” on getting this number down. “Currently, results are taking up to 33 weeks from the time a smear test is taken. In some cases, this is taking longer. The HSE is absolutely focused on processing outstanding tests and reducing these waiting times as quickly as possible, which we recognise are extremely difficult for women.” The HSE said it had been working particularly closely with MedLab, the laboratory with the largest number of smear tests waiting to be processed. “We are making steady progress in this regard with the overall number of outstanding smear tests reducing. As of 26th May 2019, 63,795 CervicalCheck smear tests were waiting to be processed.” The average reporting times for the other two labs being used have now reduced to eight weeks or less. The introduction of a new, more accurate test for cervical cancer is being delayed by the backlog of smear tests. Minister for Health Simon Harris recently pledged to introduce HPV testing “as soon as possible”.“The introduction of primary HPV screening is in line with developments in cervical screening internationally. Ireland will be among the first countries in the world to make this transition,” he said in recent parliamentary correspondence. “The HSE has been engaging with other countries who have already made the switch – the Netherlands, and Australia – or who are preparing to do so, to identify learnings for the project across a range of workstreams including reconfiguration of laboratories, procurement, ICT and colposcopy services,” he said. “I have asked the HSE to introduce HPV testing as the primary screening method for the prevention of cervical cancer as soon as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Group co-operating with review into TD\u0026rsquos now-abandoned personal injury claimTwo men arrested after police respond to Sunday afternoon call about an assaultTwo men and an elderly woman die in separate crashes in Dublin, Kerry and TipperaryFamily obliged to pay for alternative flights, accommodation and travel costing \u0026euro1,500Revival group\u0026rsquos plans for Dublin main thoroughfare include 50 benches and illuminating the SpireNew figures reveal almost 65,000 women still waiting to receive smear test resultsCouncillor submits resignation from party over \u0026lsquointernal battle\u0026rsquoRhodes programme says no one has ever turned it down in favour of MitchellIFSC-headquartered developer predicts its US portfolio will grow to a total value of \u0026euro336mGovernment is hoping key rulings on settlements will alleviate the insurance crisisSocial media giant lobbied Paschal Donohoe on proposal in January meetingChildcare providers warn that new adult-staff ratios will increase costsBellvilla on Dublin\u0026rsquos South Circular Road renovated and extended for almost \u0026euro5mOncotype test reveals hormone therapy alone sufficient treatment for many womenDrone footage highlights damage to houses and rubbish problem in Ballybane estateThen-taoiseach told Sheryl Sandberg Ireland would take \u0026lsquominimalist\u0026rsquo approach to rulesMinister of State to attend Stand Up to Trump rally during US president\u0026rsquos Irish visitFund established by Government described by Fianna F\u0026aacuteil as \u0026lsquomonumental failure\u0026rsquoAt St Clare\u0026rsquos in Harold\u0026rsquos Cross, scooting to school and composting get seal of approval"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/05/17/TELEMMGLPICT000147339863_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"judges given new expenses policy telegraph discovers judiciary","story":"The Ministry of Justice approved expenses including shampoo and crockery.  Lord Chief Justice, Lord Ian Burnett, pictured, claimed for multiple journeys to and from his homeMinistry of JusticeThe judiciary are to be given a new expenses policy after The Daily  found that Britain\u0027s most senior judges have claimed for crockery, shampoo and a taxi to transport ceremonial robes on taxpayer-funded expenses.Expenses data released under the Freedom of Information Act shows how some of the most high-profile members of the judiciary in England and Wales have had claims for everyday items as well first-class trains approved, even though they receive a salary of at least £180,000.At present, judges are encouraged to follow the expenses policy for Ministry of Justice (MOJ) civil servants, and the judiciary has also set out specific guidance relating to travel, accommodation and relocation....To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletMinistry of JusticeBrexit latest news: Jeremy Hunt says he would be prepared for no deal BrexitDonald Trump\u0026#39s UK state visit: US president lands in Britain -

Lawyers representing the woman asked the judge to partially lift the anonymity veil.Barrister William Tyzack and solicitor Alistair Myles, who is based at law firm Levison Meltzer Pigott, said the woman thought that disclosing Mr Terry\u0027s name publicly might encourage him to pay up.Judge Everall has given his approval but said neither the woman nor the girl can be named in reports. The judge said the woman is now caring for the baby in her mother\u0027s housing association flat, and living on state benefits totalling around £400 a month, and said there is evidence that Mr Terry has fathered 13 other children.He has approved the woman\u0027s claim for about £10,000 a month in maintenance, for her and the girl, and a lump sum payment of about £22,000 to cover rent payments and to buy furniture.Judge Everall said earlier this year he had ordered Mr Terry to pay interim maintenance, pending the completion of litigation.Companies House records show that Mr Terry has had an address in Burlington, Ontario, Canada, and involvement in a hair products firm called Her Imports.Mr Terry could not be reached for comment.Brexit latest news: Jeremy Hunt says he would be prepared for no deal BrexitDonald Trump\u0026#39s UK state visit: US president lands in Britain - but not before tweeting from Air Force One calling Sadiq Khan a \u0026#39stone cold loser\u0026#39Comment: Brexit will reshape the UK economy for the good and usher in a new social contract  Everything we know about Donald Trump\u0026#39s state visit to BritainComment: We must stop pointing fingers and work together to tackle the environment\u0026#39s biggest threatsBritain\u0026#39s Got Talent 2019 final, as it happened: singing war veteran Colin Thackeray wins variety contestChess piece bought for £5 and kept in a drawer for 50 years is missing treasure worth £1mSudan protests: \u0026#39Five dead and dozens injured\u0026#39 as troops try to disperse demonstratorsComment: Who, in this swollen and ever-widening field, can truly claim to be a Tory?Drinking 25 cups of coffee a day \u0026#39will not harm heart\u0026#39Inmates routinely let out halfway into term amid calls for review of automatic early releaseComment: President Trump deserves a welcome befitting the status of his office and his great countryBoris Johnson plans to spend at least £5,000 on every secondary school pupil in first domestic policy pledgeDonald Trump prepared to challenge May over UK role in starting Russian links investigationAllow young people to dip into pension pots to fund first home deposit, says Housing SecretaryD-Day veterans set sail for \u0026#39emotional\u0026#39 return to Normandy 75 years after invasion We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/02/TELEMMGLPICT000170900822_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"no point sending children eton education genes says geneticist","story":"Sending children to private schools like Eton is a waste of time according to a leading scientist Sending children to private schools like Eton is a waste of time because academic success is written in the genes meaning youngsters would do just as well at the local comprehensive, a leading scientist has claimed.Robert Plomin, Professor of Behavioural Genetic at King’s College London, said he and his team had spent decades trying to unpick how much of achievement in education was down to nature or nurture.He concluded that 50 per cent of academic success is due to genes, but they are yet to discover what accounts for the other half. What they do now know, however, is it is not due to schooling or upbringing.Studies have shown that adopted twins with the same genetics do just as well academically even if they have had vastly different education or parents. Although selective schools like Eton achieve higher grades, it is the selection process itself which accounts for the difference, and that same cohort would achieve the same marks if sent to a state school, Prof Plomin argues.Speaking at The Hay Festival, he said: “Do differences in the quality of school make a difference in outcomes like GCSE scores or getting into universities? “There’s a correlation there – kids who go to selective schools have a GCSE score that is one full grade higher than kids who go to comprehensive schools.“But if you correct for what the schools selected on, there’s no difference in GCSE scores. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy. If you select the very best kids academically, yes they go on and do well. But have you added value? The answer is no. ‘So why send your kids to Eton? Don’t. If all you’re doing it for is educational achievement. Schools matter, kids have got to learn all this stuff. But do they make a difference? The answer is no.”Eton currently costs more than £40,000-a-year and 19 of Britain’s Prime Ministers were educated at the school. Prof Plomin accepted that parents may want to send there children to fee-paying schools to mix with the ‘right sort of people’ but said they shouldn’t expect the institutions to improve their grades.Private schools may also instil confidence, leadership skills or connections which improve job prospects in later life, he conceded. Although just seven per cent of children in Britain attended public school, over a third of MPs, half of medical consultants and two thirds of high court judges had a private education. But he added: “Differences in GCSE results for selective and non selective schools are not an index for the quality of education the schools provide. “Even though schools have little effect on inidual differences in school achievement, some parents will still decide to pay huge amounts of money to send their children to private schools in order to give their children whatever alight advantage such schools provide.“I hope it will help parents who cannot afford to pay for private schooling or move house to know that it doesn’t make much of a difference in children’s school achievement.”Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

We have a long tradition of open swimming and we don’t need overreach from a relatively new sport who doesn’t really understand.”20 of Britain\u0026#039s best wild swimming spotsThere are currently 30 UK venues who have Sh2out accreditation, where the operator has been recognised as reaching a minimum safety standard for enthusiasts wanting to swim there.Many organisers of open water swimming sessions seek their professional guidance and benefit from their venue appearing  more secure to the public after they have been approved.However, a sense of unease over a blanket safety standard that does not factor in the different conditions of inidual sites and swimmers has been voiced by many.There is concern among organisers that an increasing number of private venues will feel pressured to adopt the accreditation in reaction to their competitors doing the same.Kate Rew, from the Outdoor Swimming Society who has seen her group\u0027s membership grow from 300 in 2006 to 70,000 members today, added: “Everybody wants people to be safe, but there’s no absolute danger in swimming under 10 degrees that  means it shouldn\u0027t be allowed in a public venue. “It is completely arbitrary to pretend there is a temperature that is safe or not safe to swim- it entirely depends on the inidual and how well acclimatised they are and what their physical health is.”Sh2out dismissed claims that the guidelines will lead to a fall in open water swimming, pointing to the rise in participation rates since their introduction two years ago.A spokesperson  for the Sh2out partnership said: “Whilst we would always encourage swimmers of any age or ability, to take sensible precautions before they swim, it would be naïve to think that anyone could ‘police’ or restrict the desire of someone determined to swim anywhere they chose, through Sh2out or by any other means.“Sh2out is not designed to be a ‘one size fits all’ approach as in practical terms, this simply isn’t possible but rather, Sh2out aims to provide a framework of advice, guidance and support for venues, who want to maximise their water assets and increase their leisure offering, to the communities they serve, however they see fit.“Sh2out is designed to facilitate open water swimming for the benefit of everyone, making it accessible, safe, affordable and inclusive. Swimmers who see accredited venues as ‘restrictive’, ‘regulated’ or ‘killjoys’, are free to swim where they feel better suits their needs.”Want the best of The  direct to your email and WhatsApp?

Ms Merkel has said she would not stand at the next German federal elections, and that she would instead hand over the reins to a new chancellor. She has also quit her party leadership, which is now occupied by her protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer – widely referred to as AKK.“I assume the SPD will undergo a succession in short order without hindrance to the functioning of the grand coalition,” Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer.“In the CDU we believe that this is not the time to play politics.

Here we explain when Ramadan is, what happens during the religious month and when Eid al-Fitr is in .Ramadan started on the evening of Sunday, May , this year and will continue for  days until Tuesday, June .The beginning and end are determined by the lunar Islamic calendar – meaning it will depend on when the new moon is sighted.Hilal, the crescent, is usually a day or more after the astronomical new moon.The night of power or night of decree is considered the holiest night of the year, as Muslims believe the first revelation of the Koran was sent down to Muhammad on this night.Its thought to have occurred on an odd-numbered night during the last ten days of Ramadan - the , , ,  or th.The holiday of Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan and the beginning of the next lunar month.This annual observance is regarded as one of the Five Pillars of Islam.A common greeting is Ramadan Mubarak, which means have a blessed Ramadan.The word Ramadan comes from the Arabic root ramiḍa or ar-ramaḍ, which means scorching heat or dryness.Fasting is obligatory for adult Muslims, except those who are suffering from an illness, travelling, are elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating.The fast is from dawn to sunset, with a pre-dawn meal known as Suhur and sunset meal called Iftar.Muslims engage in increased prayer and charity during Ramadan.Ramadan is also a month where Muslims try to practice increased self-discipline.As well as fasting - abstaining from eating and drinking during daylight hours - Muslims are encouraged to read the entire Koran throughout the month, before the holy festival of Eid al-Fitr.Ramadan is seen as a time of spiritual reflection, improvement and increased devotion and worship.Muslims are expected to rigorously follow the teachings of Islam and this includes fasting - which teaches people how to be more self-disciplined and have empathy for those less fortunate.The pre-dawn meal before the fast is called the Suhur, while the meal at sunset that breaks the fast is the Iftar.In addition to abstaining from eating and drinking, Muslims also increase restraint, such as abstaining from sexual relations.The act of fasting is said to cleanse the soul by freeing it from worldly activities, in addition to the abolition of past sins.The eating of dates usually breaks the fast at sundown.After that, the usual practice is to adjourn for prayer and then the main meal is served.Eid al-Fitr  will be celebrated on Wednesday, June , .It is celebrated on the first of Shawwal after the month of Ramadan.Eid al Fitr is a festival when Muslims thank Allah - and it is forbidden to fast on this day.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Instead they smear just over half the country as backward-looking and beyond help.Even Michel Barnier seems to think it’s because we’re pining for the days of Empire, rather than to take control of our laws and borders.If the Second Referendum crowd really think Britain is about to change its mind — despite the huge number of votes for the Brexit Party last week — they need to think again.Every time people like Wheatcroft open their mouths, they give one more reason we’re better off out.IT is naive to think education is free.So the idea that you could deliver university courses without somebody paying just isn’t realistic.Tuition fees are necessary. The way they are paid back means youngsters who are bright enough can afford it in the long-run, without ever truly crippling them with debt.But nobody should be arguing that those who don’t go to university should be subsidising those who do, any more than they already do.There are some universities charging full-whack for sub-par courses, and because almost everybody is charging the maximum students don’t have much choice.

Always apply sun cream when you’ll be in the sun. Don’t forget to wait  mins before venturing out. You can burn on a cloudy day too so wear sunscreen evenits not sunny. Reapply, reapply, reapply. You can burn in the UK too. Make sure youre using the correct SPFOver half Brits admitted they regularly miss areas of the body when applying sun protection.These are the areas that people are most likely to miss when applying sun cream, and how many of us dont apply sun cream to this area while outdoors.. Soles of the feet -  per cent. Bottom -  per cent. Hairline parting -  per cent. Lips -  per cent. Eyelids -  per centLauren Mackenzie, head of medical aesthetics at The Hospital Group, said: “Skin cancer is one of the biggest killers in the UK, so it’s quite shocking to see the risks Brits are taking when it comes to failing to protect their skin from sun damage.It seems from our research that most people are seriously underestimating the protection needed and aren’t giving sun cream application the appropriate time and attention.“Spending an extra five minutes applying sun cream and waiting for it to start working before jumping in the water on holiday are really simple changes to make, but will certainly save your skin in the long term.Practices like this can protect you from premature ageing and more serious damage that the sun can have on your body.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boris rev up leadership campaign","story":"Having kept a low profile for the past few days, he will unveil his most senior supporter yet, with Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, set to endorse him.The Boris campaign will also unveil a slew of MPs backing him, which will put him ahead in the endorsement stakes.But just as signicant as the number supporting him is the fact that Boris’s old enemies are beginning to make peace with him. I understand that ious MPs have been to see him to say that while they won’t vote for him, they would accept his leadership.One MP who won’t be endorsing him, though, is Amber Rudd. She and Boris sat down on Thursday. But ultimately the dferences between them over Brexit policy are too great to make any kind of dream ticket work.I understand that Rudd pushed the former Foreign Secretary to budge on his commitment that the UK would leave the EU on October  with or without a deal. Johnson would not. Rudd felt that she could not support someone holding this position.Another complication was that Johnson and Rudd’s dferences on Brexit made it very hard for them to agree on a joint governing agenda. Johnson, though, should still have more votes in the first round than any other Brexiteer candidate.He needs to finish  votes clear of Dominic Raabhe is to establish himself as the clear Leave choice — Raab is more likely than him to pick up support as the second tier Brexiteer candidates drop out.As one of those backing Boris puts it: “He’s got to get as close as possible to a third on the first round.” The support of a third of MPs guarantees you a place in the members’ run-off.The problem for the former London Mayor, as this supporter acknowledges, is that “ there’s ever a perception that Boris was falling back then that would be compounded”.On the Cabinet side of the contest, Sajid Javid is attempting to reboot his campaign by today setting out his plan for how to deal with the Irish border issue.One of those backing him tells me it is “not just how you voted in the referendum, but your ability to implement no deal or negotiate with the EU” that matters. This supporter argues that Johnson and Raab aren’t going to get anything out of Brussels, while Javid might.The Cabinet side of the contest is becoming increasingly fractured. I understand that the Cabinet Ministers most opposed to No Deal have privately agreed to back either Matt Hancock or Rory Stewart in the first round. Both are running interesting campaigns.Stewart is out doing social media walkabouts, while Hancock is making arguments that the other candidates are being forced to follow. I’m told that next week he will propose a levy on betting companies to fund treatment for gambling addiction.The energy of these campaigns is causing trouble for the more established Cabinet contenders. I understand that backers of one of them are now warning MPs: “Go to bed with Hancock, wake up with Boris.”But Jeremy Hunt’s biggest problem is the sense that, in the words of one senior Tory, he is a “completely wasted place” in the final two as it is hard to see how he could beat a Brexiteer candidate.This is why a growing number of Tories think the party is “heading to the destined psycho-drama” of a Boris Gove run-off.BATTEN down the hatches, hurricane Donald is blowing into town. As his interview in this newspaper demonstrates, Donald Trump won’t be governed by the normal diplomatic conventions on his State visit.He is more than happy to make known his admiration for Boris Johnson, despite the Tory leadership contest. Though some of the rival camps think Trump’s blessing will be a double-edged sword.It is the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who will greet Trump on his arrival, which will give Hunt the chance to burnish his statesman credentials. Hunt will also be involved in Tuesday’s Downing Street talks between Trump and Mrs May.Penny Mordaunt, the Defence Secretary, who is expected to throw her hat into the leadership ring, will meet with the President’s daughter, Ivanka, to discuss female economic empowerment.Trump is not an easy President to deal with. But he is the leader of our closest and most important security ally. UK politicians must also realise that on ious issues, including China and the role of Huawei in G networks, the Trump position represents the new political consensus in the US.The UK would be mad to endanger its most import- ant intelligence relationship over this issue.THE next test for Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party comes on Thursday, with the Peterborough by-election.If Farage’s party can win, it will show how Brexit has redrawn the political landscape. It will give the Brexit Party a toe-hold in Parliament and a chance to become a formidable political force.Butthe Brexit Party can’t take a seat which voted heavily for Leave in the aftermath of its Labour MP being sent to prison, then its current momentum will be checked.CABINET on Tuesday has been cancelled. This is surprising given that it didn’t meet this week as Parliament was in recess. The official reason for it not taking place is that there is too much on with the Trump visit and D-Day commemorations.But as one minister points out to me, it is hard to believe that Cabinet would have been cancelledit hadn’t been for the fact that Theresa May is resigning as Tory party leader at the end of the week.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is the Cabinet.It is not only Theresa May who let down Conservative Party voters, members and supporters.She was abetted and supported by her Cabinet. In this country we operate a system of collective responsibility and it is not good enough for Cabinet members now to claim they held a dferent view or would have done things dferently.How can it be right that Cabinet Ministers, who were complicit with the failed Brexit polices of Chequers, the Withdrawal Agreement and the subsequent betrayal of Brexit, credibly seek to claim they are an acceptable choice for this role They were sat around the top table when decisions were made and must take responsibility for them.I would sup with a very long spoon indeed with those who are complicit but now claiming they can offer the Party new leadership and direction.The British public are not stupid and our Party members know what they are voting for.They wont be fooled by those born-again ‘Leavers’, who trumpet their devotion to Brexit even though they have done nothing for the last three years to advance theof British sovereignty.The British public and our long suffering Party members know where the responsibility for the greatest breach of trust in our democratic institutions lies.After three years of being repeatedly told that ‘nothing has changed’, the time has come for ‘everything to change’.The British people are desperate for our country to leave the EU on st October. They are crying out for leadership which will put the country and our people first.The European Elections clearly reflect that and anybody who has knocked on doors or engaged the public in recent times knows that.We simply must move on and move out of the EU and fast.And in doing so we must move into a trade negotiation as has been outlined through numerous proposals over the last  months.Unfortunately Theresa May’s Cabinet showed themselves unwilling to listen to detailed proposals which would have a delivered the genuine Brexit the public voted for.So now the priority is to exit the European Union and move forward to negotiating a future relationship with protects British interests and keeps open the global prizes and benefits of Brexit which the British people voted for.Ministers who claim they are pro-brexit have failed to stand up for the . million who voted to leave and make that robust case to deliver the referendum mandate.The people were promised we would have left the EU months ago and that ‘no deal was better than a bad deal’.Having danced to the tune of the tune of the EU, spent billions of pounds on ‘no deal’ preparations, our country must just get on and leave the EU.Too many people in our political class lack confidence in our country and trust in the public. They have sought the comfort of the EU making our laws rather than making the decisions themselves. No wonder the British people feel betrayed.They expected the UK to leave the EU on th March as they were promised. Every day longer we remain in the EU adds salt to that wound.The governing class has broken trust in our politics.The British people voted to take back control and for Britain to be free, independent and self-governing again.

I take them at their word - so on that basis the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead.Instead, I have a pragmatic three-step plan - a plan to deliver Brexit in a way that protects citizens of the UK and the EU, delivers certainty to businesses, and maintains the integrity of our United Kingdom.No more preicating. No more fearmongering. And no more limbo. Just compassionate and decisive action that demonstrates leadership.My first step will be to take sensible measures to enshrine certain agreements into law, and to protect our people.I will immediately introduce key legislation to address this.First, I will introduce a citizens’ rights bill. EU citizens who have built lives here, and UK citizens who have made their homes in the EU must have the weight of uncertainty lted from their shoulders.Second, I will introduce a bill that locks in the mutually beneficial measures that have already been agreed between the UK and EU.This will cover areas like citizens’ rights in Gibraltar, our sovereign bases overseas, security and intelligence-sharing relationships, transport, data, and medicines.It is in everyone’s interest to put these agreed arrangements in place, and I believe many MPs would support this, regardless of how they voted in the referendum.The second step is to give businesses and industry the confidence and certainty they need to plan for a managed exit. I want them to be able to invest, hire, and innovate with renewed optimism.So we will ramp up preparations for our managed exit, focusing efforts on delivering alternative arrangements for the Northern Ireland border with the EU.Our continued strong bond with Northern Ireland will be protected.There are some sensitive sectors that rely upon ‘just-in-time’ supply chains, like automotive and aerospace. I know how important these are, and we will propose specic regulatory agreements with the EU for these.For other industries, like medicines and agri-foods, we will seek specic customs agreements on tarfs and non-tarf barriers. This will protect trade in the most vital goods and services but allow us to embrace new free trade deals around the world.At the core of this work will be open communication to Parliament, the public, and EU colleagues about progress, to build an environment of confidence and certainty. Parliament will receive regular updates, and households and businesses will receive communication from government that provides clear information about our managed exit.Transparency will be at the heart of everything I do - it’s what parliament expects, and it’s what the public deserves.The third step will be to lead a delegation of UK Ministers to meet with the EU Council and the proposed new EU Commissioners, to talk directly about the wide-ranging preparations we are making for a managed exit on October .Discussions will culminate in a UK EU summit, in September, in Belfast and Dublin, where the EU Council and proposed Commission will be invited to agree which measures we will all accept, to ensure a properly managed exit.As Prime Minister, I will not advocate an extension of any kind, and it will be clear that in all circumstances the UK will leave the EU at the end of October. With comprehensive arrangements in place, we will be prepared for any eventuality.We owe it to the country, and to our strong democratic tradition, to fulfil the instruction that our voters gave us.I am a passionate, pragmatic and positive believer in Brexit, and with my three-step plan, we can decisively leave the EU. We can demonstrate to the world that the UK remains a beacon for opportunity, fairness and democratic leadership. We can restore that vital trust between politics and the people.It’s not too late to take advantage of the opportunities we hoped for in voting Leave.

A few like me survived but many didn’t.”Radio operator Alan, from Eye, Suffolk, and his crew had caught the last ship heading out to France from Gosport, Hants, after their Sherman tank was among several that broke down on the way to the harbour.He remembers watching General Bernard Montgomery drive past the convoy of stranded tanks waiting to be repaired and recalls: “Monty was in a vile temper as he went by in his car.”Then, after a night spent bucking and rolling in the choppy English Channel with no rations or sleep, a Naval officer stuck his head around the corner of the ship’s metal corridor and said: “Oh you poor buggers, you’re going now.”Just after am, as the tiny Landing Ship Tank  approached the Normandy coast, it looked asJuno Beach was on fire.At .am the battleship HMS Warspite launched a broadside – the starting signal for the assault.Alan recalls: “There was a small infantry ship alongside us which was hit by a German shell. It sank and the soldiers were thrown overboard.“The men were all in the water, thrashing about. Some were dead, some were injured. Others were trying to save themselves.“The ship went over the top of them and they were all chopped up into bits by the propellers.“As we went in, legs, arms, bodies and heads floated along in with us on a rising tide. It was a terrible sight.”The landing ship was carrying a lorry which was also hit by a shell and burst into flames. Alan says: “The lorry was blazing like mad and the tank behind it rammed it off the ship. Four tanks blundered off on to the shore.“The beach masters were shouting at us to fire this way and that but because the tank had been so heavily waterproofed, we couldn’t turn the turret or fire the gun.“Then they were shouting, ‘Get off the beach, get off the beach!’“So we went hell for leather across two roads, out into the countryside where we found a big depression where the Germans had been digging soil to make defences. We got into the hole to try to scrape off some of the waterproofing.“Shells were going one way, bullets the other way. I was terried.“The radios were no use. The British dialects were so strong you couldn’t understand what was being said, especially when they started swearing. It was a shambles.“Our officer, Goodwin his name was, said, ‘I think I’d better go and see what is happening’. But Jerry spotted him, dropped a mortar and he got hit in the back with shrapnel. He went back on the same ship he came in on.”Separated from their regiment and with no orders to follow, the crew of Alan’s Sherman made their own way until they found other tanks.He says: “There was a scream overhead and word went round that there was a German Tiger tank in the woods ahead. An officer came up with what they called a tank destroyer.“It had a bigger gun than what the German tank carried but it had no armour at all. It took a direct hit and bits flew everywhere.”Later, they found themselves leading a convoy, and Alan’s tank was hit as it climbed a railway embankment.Infantrymen managed to drag the crew out. As they waited for the Sherman to be repaired, they caught their first sleep in days.Alan says: “The only thing we did have in the way of food was cans of cocoa or soup.”After smashing through “Rommel’s asparagus” – wooden poles strung with wire to entangle British paratroopers and gliders – they fought German Panzers near Pegasus Bridge.Later, they were ordered to attack a chateau near Sannerville being used as SS headquarters. Alan, who worked as an engineer in Suffolk after his military career ended, says: “I looked through my periscope and I saw a German stand up as calm as can be with his bazooka.“Bang, off went our left-hand track. Shells were coming in all ways. Our tanks were being blown up right, left and centre. In his memoirs Monty said, ‘We lost a few’. We lost nearly  tanks in one day.”On July , Alan’s crew was still in the thick of the action north of Caen when the tank commander, Cpl Louis Wilkes, dropped down from the turret, blood pouring from his head.Alan says: “I ed under the gun and held him in my arms while we got him to a field dressing station, where the medics laid him out. I had lost my best friend. He was  years old and married with two children.“We rolled him up in his blankets and buried him in a grave we dug ourselves in an orchard, placing his tin hat to mark where we laid him.”Forty years later Alan found his friend’s grave had been moved to the military cemetery at Cambes-en-Plaine.Alan’s story features in a new book A Time To Fight, by Robert Anderson, published by Unorm.Read the remarkable stories of the ing veterans from our superb souvenir pulloutLes Reeves, Corporal, Royal Armoured CorpsIT was pm on D-Day before tank driver Cpl Les Reeves, who was attached to  Royal Armoured Corps, landed on Juno Beach.A veteran of El Alamein, he had already been in combat many times but was still extremely nervous.Les, who will be  on June , says: “Those who said they weren’t nervous were either fools or liars.“We hit the sea and we were submerged before the beach appeared in front of you. Our first hit was a German pillbox, which we blew up from  yards.“We were firing two- pounders, which were like pea-shooters against the Panzers which were equipped with mm guns.“The Germans had superior arms. The best pistol in the world was the Luger. They had the best machine-gun of the war, the Spandau, and, of course, they had the Tiger tank.“How did we win the war  We steamrolled them but would never have wonthe Yanks hadn’t come in.”Les drove his Churchill tank through Normandy, survived the carnage at Arnhem in the failed Operation Market Garden and the Battle of the Bulge before pressing on into Germany. Near Osna-bruck, the first tank in a convoy of three was hit.The next thing Les remembers is waking up in hospital in Oxford nine days later. The rest of his tank’s crew had all been killed. Les only survived because a metal plate attached to the tank’s turret protected him from the blast.But a piece of metal lodged in his head, leaving him blind for six months and paralysed down one side.Les ed home, to Walsall, West Mids, was married for  years to Della and ran his own business selling frozen food and commercial fridges.After the attack, it was another year before movement ed to his right hand, arm and leg.Les added: “It seems to me that sadly anyone under  doesn’t even know what D-Day was. They don’t know about Operation Market Garden.”Les has a severely autistic relative and was recently informed by a council official that a meeting about their welfare had been arranged for November .He says: “I told the woman, who was in her late thirties, ‘We can’t do that – it’s Armistice Day’.“She replied, ‘It may be important to you but not to me’. I was disgusted.Leonard Emmings, Coxswain, Royal NavyLEONARD “TED” EMMINGS was the ­coxswain of a Royal Navy landing craft bringing soldiers on to Juno Beach on the morning of D-Day.Carrying a platoon of  from the Queen’s Own Rles of Canada, Tedsteered his landing craft toward the shore.He says: “Our mission was, ‘Whatever you do, you’ve got to get your troops off’.“We were told, ‘It doesn’t matter what is going on around you – it’s your job to put the soldiers on the beach’.”Arriving under a hail of gunfire, Ted’s craft hit an obstacle and his crew had to kick its ramp down.Despite the damage, Ted’s crew were able to get all  troops out and on to the beach.He recalls: “We were one of the first lot to hit Juno Beach – the first wave.” But what Ted, from Guildford, Surrey, saw that day will never leave him.He says: “You got in as far as you could. You dropped your ramp and that was the signal to come out. That is when they were picked off.”The landing-craft coxswains spent days at the Normandy beaches in the initial assault, bringing more and more troops to further the Allied advance.Les says: “We were one of the first waves in but when we came back later on during the day, you could see all the blown-up landing craft and the bodies of the guys in the water – both dead and the ones slowly moving.” At one point, Ted’s craft hit an obstacle which detonated a mine.He says matter-of-factly: “We sank and got picked up out of the water. We didn’t have time to be scared.”Having survived that day, Ted saw many Canadian friends, who he had spent months training with, perish on the Normandy beaches. He says: “They came over here, trained over here, died over here. They never made it across the beach.“People should be told about it. I feel so sorry for the Canadians. I wonder how many of those got back to Canada one way or another.”Having lost so many of his mates, Ted has not missed a memorial since.The -year-old says: “I always go to Bayeux cemetery because two of my crew are there.”After the war, Ted worked for the Forestry Commission until he retired – but losing all those friends will always haunt him. He says: “We won the war in the end but whether it was worth it I don’t know.“I feel so sorry for the Canadians, as a lot didn’t get to go back home.”Ted Cordery, Torpedo Operator, HMS BelfastA VETERAN’S tears of grief for his fallen friends,  years after they died at ­Normandy, showed the nation just how raw the wounds of D-Day remain.In February Ted Cordery, , moved viewers when he wept on Good Morning Britain and said: “I lost shipmates I served with. I’ve seen their ashes go over the side.”He added: “I’m not the hero – they are the heroes.”As an able seaman on HMS Belfast on D-Day, Ted helped as dozens of wounded soldiers were brought off the beaches.He told viewers: “These soldiers could have been wounded a mile or two inland.Most of them never made it. They were taken to sick bays where most of them died.”He added: “It’s such a waste of a young le. I try to imagine how they ­suffered from a mile inland until they were lted on to the ship.”Ted was  when he ­volunteered in , choosing to join the Navy because his four brothers were in the Army. He already knew the harsh realities of war. At , he had seen his home in West Ham in East London bombed.He joined HMS Belfast and became a torpedo operator. When the ship was brought in to support the D-Day landings, Ted opened fire on the enemy. He said: “We were firing from the Belfast with the help of a spotter plane to provide support for the initial landings and provide cover fire for the troops.“The sight of all those troops being lowered into the water from the ships, some you knew would never make it to land, was just astounding.“It’s a memory that sticks with me – all those small boats full of men trying to get up on to the beaches . . . and the sight of those that didn’t make it.”Ted added: “When I landed on the beaches I saw the devastation. A few days later, out of nowhere, a local Frenchman passed on a bike, spat at my feet then carried on.“I was so angry and started to go after him. Luckily, my commanding officer told me to calm down and I stopped.“I thought, ‘He doesn’t know who I am and what I’m doing there. He could have lost his home, same as me’.”After the war, Ted worked as a Fleet Street printer. He married and lived in Oxford.Percy Lewis, Signalman, st Battalion Black WatchSIGNALMAN Percy Lewis was  on D-Day. His ­regiment suffered huge losses on Sword Beach and in the days that followed he ended up serving with the st Battalion Black Watch in a unit made up of men from other regiments.He said: “We were advancing through Holland. There was a bit of expected scrapping but after a week or so we advanced on this small village near a forest at night.“The way you advance, one platoon goes forward, then two platoons come up and you stop. And then they go through you. You are leapfrogging all the time.“We didn’t know where we were and I was told to send a signal back that we were all right because it was quiet. I couldn’t get through so was sent back on foot.”On his way back, Percy was captured by German paratroopers. He was taken into a building where he found a fellow soldier on the floor, covered in a blanket, begging for help for his hand.Percy said: “There was hardly anything of his right hand. It was all bleeding and two German medics were doing nothing.“I took out his field dressing and started bandaging it up. I put the tourniquet on and askedhe was all right. I’d just got him some water when someone dragged me up from behind.”A German officer with a rle pushed Percy up a flight of stairs where he was greeted by gunfire and the sight of a Panzer tank. He had been captured by the German th Parachute regiment and was handed over to the nd Panzer Grenadiers, shackled and placed in a makesht cell in the cellar of a nearby castle.Percy, from Windsor, Berks, said: “There were three beds with two blokes lying on the other two, but the beds were just the raw springs. The other two men were asleep but covered head to toe in mud, and they stank.”For the next ten days a German commander interrogated him daily about his mission, ision and unit as the number of men in the cell grew from three to .Eventually he was released, and after the war Percy ed to carpentry, the trade he learned before war broke out.He has ed to Arromanches in Normandy to remember his fallen friends almost every year since .He said: “When I first joined the Normandy veterans, Surrey branch, there were  of us.There was so much noise with bombs dropping everywhere – you couldn’t hear yourself talkCommando, Royal MarinesBOY soldier Joe Corless lied about his age to sign up at  – and marked his th birthday battling enemy fire at D-Day.Joe, , says: “A lot went in as boys but you came out a man – a lot wiser.”The son of a Boer War veteran, Joe adds: “On my th birthday I cycled  miles to Plymouth with two friends and we volunteered for the ­Marines. We told them we were  and we got away with it. They needed young men.”Recalling D-Day itself, Joe, from Bridgend, says: “On landing, all we saw was water and about , ships.“We were driving the boat in and out all the time.“On the initial landing, the blokes had to go over the side and swim. After that, you’d drop your ramp on the beach and the blokes would run ashore.“We would go to and fro bringing people in off the dferent ships.“We had sailors, commandos and shallow-water ers – or frogmen – whose jobs were to cut the barbed wire and disarm explosives.“The naval ships were shelling and there were bombs dropping all over the place. You couldn’t hear ­yourself talk.“Instead, we communicated by ­semaphore.”Joe landed at Lion-sur- Mer on Sword Beach – under heavy enemy fire. He says: “We didn’t know where they were, but they had guns up there ­damaging us.“There were six-inch anti-personnel shells. They would scatter their shrapnel and make holes in your boat. I was just standing there and lucky nobody shot me.”Instead, Joe – armed with two Lewis guns on his craft – managed to take out an enemy plane. He says: “These two ­German e bombers came in and we all had to open fire and we hit one and destroyed it. A report came over the tannoy, ‘Well done, Marines!’.To align his craft, Joe was given a map reference of a house up on the hill.Years later, he ed to Normandy with fellow former Marine George Davis, who recalls: “We found the house, and when we saw the front, Joe ­recognised it. He was absolutely thrilled to bits this house was still there.”Joe became an engineer after the war, working in power stations and chemical plants. But he never forgot the friends he lost in battle.He says: “You had mates going in but you didn’t have them when you come back. But it was what we trained for – and I have never gloried in it.“The survivors are all getting older now but D-Day should never be forgotten – like those close friends we lost.”Albert Price, Tank Operator, Royal DragoonsHAVING watched his friends die during a training exercise six weeks earlier, Albert Price was one of the first men on to Gold Beach.At  years of age, he had been part of Operation Smash, the largest live-ammunition practice of World War Two.It was supposed to herald the success of the new DD Valentine tanks which could “sail” on the sea then drive on land. But instead of a ­successful preparation for D-Day, five tanks sank and six men perished.Albert, , who now lives in Solihull, West Mids, says: “I managed to get out when my tank started to go down but other men weren’t so lucky. We knew we had to do it again in Normandy so we put it behind us and focused on the task in hand.”Albert had joined the th th Royal ­Dragoon Guards in  and he says of June , : “When we set off I think all of us felt very proud, but none of us knew we’d be taking part in something that would go down in history.”After landing, Albert’s unit happened upon an enemy building in the distance and groups of retreating soldiers.“There were lots of German infantry marching away,” he recalls. “I remember how archaic their columns looked – there were no tanks or armoured vehicles.“There were horses pulling things and what looked like ­furniture vans. We fired upon them and while I didn’t care about the German loss of le, the horses being killed really stuck with me.” But Albert’s D-Day ended after a skirmish with the th Panzer ision on day two.He says: “I had my head on the tank telescope. I heard a loud blast and someone shouting, ‘We’ve been hit’. It was like a sheet of red came across my entire face.”With blood pouring from a head wound sustained from the telescope, Albert fled out of the tank.He says: “There was machine gun fire all around us. I was shot in my left foot and a ricochet hit my right shoulder.“A fire was raging so I backed away as best I could. I was still trying to move when a black figure walked past me.“I barely recognised him as our driver because he was burned so badly.”Albert was eventually rescued and taken back to an aid station.He says: “My tags said I was ­Catholic even though I wasn’t and the padre came and gave me my last rites as I waited evacuation.”After the war, Albert lived in Canada for  years. He ed to Britain and worked in insurance.Recalling ato Normandy, he said: “I found the graves of the men I served with but I ­prefer to remember them as the men they were, not the men buried there.”Marion Loveland, Wren Third Officer, Royal NavyMARION LOVELAND was working in the Navy pay office on D-Day.But she remembers June  for all the wrong reasons because her fiancé, marine commando Alec Aldis, died serving his country on Sword Beach.Marion, , from Southampton, recalls: “Alec and I hadn’t told anyone about us. I read in the lists he’d been killed and from then on I lost my love of ­service and left the Navy.”Marion was familiar with Forces le, as her father was a colonel in the Royal Marines and her mother was a Wren during World War One.Marion says: “I grew up on a barracks so it was a le I already knew. I’d got a job at BP in London but then war broke out so I signed up to serve.”The -year-old was posted to ­Eastney Barracks, Hants, where her father served, and it is there she met Alec, a signal officer in  Commando Royal Marines. She says: “He was very reticent to pursue ­anything because of who my father was.”With the war ratcheting up, Marion was posted to The Old Naval College in Greenwich, far from her fiancé. She recalls: “The last time I saw Alec, a few days before D-Day, he asked me to marry him at Christmas when he got back.”But Alec landed on Sword Beach, which had very little cover, and was killed. Marion recalls: “I was at work and saw a report saying he’d been KIA. It affected me badly and after that I wanted to leave the Navy.”While her engagement had been a secret, Marion’s parents knew she had suffered a loss. She says: “Dad didn’t know the details but they knew I’d been hugely affected.”Marion ed to her job at BP and met her husband Stuart, who she married in .While she will pay her respects today to those who lost their lives, she will also be celebrating her th birthday. She says: “It is D-Day memorials first then maybe lunch in a restaurant.”On her birthday in , she recalls: “I went to ­dinner with friends and saw planes flying over.“It didn’t even cross my mind that Alec wouldn’t come back.”Christian Lamb, Plottings Officer, Royal NavyWHEN teenager Christian Lamb joined the Wrens, one of her main concerns was what type of hat she would wear.But her skills landed her in Churchill’s office in Whitehall making top-secret maps for the D-Day invasion.Now, , Christian, from Battersea, South West London, recalls: “I joined the Wrens in  at . I discovered I was going to be a rating, so I wouldn’t have an officer’s hat. Disaster!“I had to have the worst hat instead.”Christian was offered a job at head office but says: “I had joined to be surrounded by naval ships full of luscious- looking sailors. So I said, ‘No thanks!’ ”Transferred to Plymouth as a plottings officer working on the radar covering the Atlantic, she would enjoy nights out with submariners ing from the Med.She says: “We all had great fun and parties on board the ­submarines.” Later transferred to Belfast, Christian met John Lamb, a First Lieutenant. She recalls: “We got engaged in ten days. We were ­married for about  years with three children and seven grandchildren.”Christian was transferred to Churchill’s Whitehall office in  where she helped prepare maps for the Normandy landings under total secrecy.She says: “There were many of us working on inidual pieces of the ­jigsaw but none of us knew what the ­others were doing. My brief was to ­pinpoint everything identiable that could be seen from the bridge of an approaching landing craft.“The large-scale Ordnance Survey maps showed all those roads, churches, castles and every possible feature that would be visible.“Anything notable, I put on my maps. It had to be accurate.“Churchill had an office upstairs and we used to see secret people doing all sorts of exciting things.”Christian was then posted to Falmouth to join her husband, who had ed with a convoy.She says: “When D-Day came, I remember hearing reports on the radio.“It was absolutely ­thrilling. They probably used my maps to make a base for their plans.”Tom Hill, Coxswain, Royal MarinesAFTER spending  days on Sword Beach, Tom Hill believes he was ­fortunate to survive.Tom, , from Purley, Berks, was  when he signed up to the Royal Marines in .“To join other regiments you had to be ,” he recalls with a smile.Working as a tool setter – a protected profession – Tom gave up his job to serve his country.“We had no idea D-Day was happening,” he says. “We were on a ship in ­Portsmouth and we would often pick up Army soldiers and take them to Scotland, so we presumed it was a ­normal day, a normal job.”But when -year-old Tom, a landing craft coxswain, saw the soldiers handling French money, he suspected something dferent was about to happen.On the SS Empire Battleaxe, Tom was part of a flotilla that landed at Sword Beach. He and his crew of four had to ferry soldiers in Landing Craft Assaults, or LCAs, from the main ships into the shallows at Sword to fight.Tom says: “I could see other LCAs with their doors blown off.“There was one beside me. The sergeant had one engine and couldn’t fire the other. The body of one of our troops was wrapped on the propeller.”Tom and his crew ferried in hundreds of troops and supplies to advance the attack.“One day we were eating when I had an urge to gun the LCA’s engines. As it lurched forward, a shell landed where we’d been a few seconds earlier. I can’t explain it to this day.”Just days after their narrow escape, Tom’s craft was delivering letters when a captain told them to stay over on one side of the boat. Intrigued, Tom’s team rounded on the ship only to realise a shell had gone down its hatch, ­killing every soldier inside.Tom and his crew continued their work, but on their th day they were hit and their LCA sank.“We swam to an American tugboat,” Tom recalls. “The captain told us they were ing to America and did the four of us want to come.“But we rejoined a British ship and were given five days’ survivors leave.“My sister came to Portsmouth to visit me for the day.”When he rejoined his unit after leave, they started an -month commission all over the Pacic.Tom, a school caretaker for  years before he retired, says: “While I’ve been fortunate to marry, have children and live a long le, it is never easy being one of the lucky ones. So many good men I served with didn’t get to see the world in peace.Ian Forsyth, Trooper, th Armoured DivisionFOR Ian Forsyth, D-Day was only the start of an -month odyssey.He went on to survive being blown up in his tank and ­liberate the Bergen- Bn ­concentration camp.Ian, from Rosehearty, Aberdeenshire, was a -year-old trainee teacher when he took part in the ­Normandy Landings as a radio operator.He said: “As well as operating the wireless it was also my job to load the gun.”The trooper’s th Armoured Division broke out of the Normandy beachhead and harried Hitler’s Nazis all the way back to Germany.They headed to Northern France and then Belgium where they captured Antwerp. By March , they had also captured the German city of Lubeck.Ian, , recalls: “It was a constant ­battle. You got brief periods of respite before you were on the go again.“We lived and slept inside those tanks and they were not built for comfort. They were claustrophobic and very warm.”Three times Ian was in a tank that was hit by shells – but he says: “The worst that happened to me was losing my front teeth and suffering an injury to my hand.“It all depended which side you were on when the shell hit.“Sadly others weren’t so lucky. There were only three of us left at the end of the war from a troop of .”In April , Ian and his troop arrived at Bergen-Bn.The Brits were un- prepared for the sight of , emaciated sick prisoners – and more than , corpses. Tears fill Ian’s eyes as he recalls: “I couldn’t believe what I saw. The smell from the decomposing bodies was unbelievable.“Prisoners were looking at us through the barbed wire. We disobeyed orders and threw food over the fence.“But the folk at the back crushed ­forward and trampled to death the folk at the front. We made a bad, bad ­mistake but we didn’t know any better.”Ian’s war didn’t finish until the surrender of Hitler’s successor Admiral Donitz on May , .Returning home, he finished his ­training and went on to teach ­engineering. He now lives in Hamilton, Lanarks.The grandfather of five had two daughters with his we Margaret, who passed away in  – and he also has three great-grandchildren. Memories of the war stay with him.He said: “I thought I was going to help to change the world – it wasn’t long after D-Day before I lost that dream and I was fighting to ­survive.”John Bell, Bomb Aimer, Bomber CommandWHEN the war started in , John Bell was  and took his father’s advice to leave school and get a job “because the war won’t last long”.He started work as an office boy at an accountancy firm in the City of London but, inspired by hearing the Battle of Britain overhead in , he joined the RAF as soon as he was .John, now  and living in Worthing, West Sussex, said: “I was ft in and was told I was too tall to be a pilot, so I signed up as an observer-navigator and had gun training in South Africa. In  I was assigned to Lancasters as a bomb aimer.”A member of  Squadron, John and his crew flew all over France and Germany in the months before D-Day as part of the RAF’s Bomber Command.With crews expected to perform  ops before going on brief leave, John and his six fellow airmen spent the first few months of  flying over Northern France.He said: “There were targets and we didn’t know at the time but they were all ­connected to the invasion – ammunition dumps, factories and the like, all targets that could have had an implication on the success of the invasion.”On June , John’s crew were told the invasion would happen the next day and they would have a pivotal role.The squadron of  Lancasters was split into groups.Taking it in turns, each group would fly two miles apart, at mph, for a minute and  seconds before flying back on themselves for one minute. Every three seconds, each plane dropped aluminium strips known as chaff to jam German radar signals.John, who is originally from Storrington, said: “Every hour we’d be replaced by another formation who would do the same thing. It was to make the Germans consider whether they had enough reinforcements on the beaches orthey needed more in the skies.“We were excited, andany of us felt nerves then no one said anything.“It was a great feeling and we were proud to take part.”As the end of the crew’s  operations approached, John recalled: “We believed we’d survive. Our rear gunner had a we and child and was a few years older than the rest of us.“He’d tell us we’d have to get home, and we believed him.“If you’re flying through bullets, someone will always survive.”After the war John saw service in Cyprus, Singapore and Washington DC before finally leaving the RAF as a Wing ­Commander in .Patricia Davies, Special Duties Linguist, Women’s Royal Naval ServiceAS a schoolgirl recovering at home from tuberculosis, Patricia Davies passed the time by chatting to the ­Austrian cook and housemaid who had been hired to help her mother.By the outbreak of war, she was  and fluent in German – making her the perfect recruit as a Wren translator.Now , Patricia, from Chiswick, West London, said: “I joined in the spring of , aged , and I was a special duties linguist, trained to intercept German naval radio signals.“We were based on an isolated little radio receiving station on top of the clf in Dover.Churchill visited five times in order to be seen in the area as part of ­Operation Fortitude – to make the Germans think we were going to land at Calais.“I’d been on night duty and came out of this building at eight o’clock in the morning and there was Churchill coming up the clf path and I think Monty was with him and a lot of staff officers.“I thought, ‘What on earth was the Prime Minister doing on top of our isolated clf at eight o’clock on a spring morning ’ Of course, he went to look at the coast opposite and no doubt intended to be seen in the area.”She continued: “We were all intensely aware D-Day was going to happen.“Our Wren officer went on June  to Dover Castle to get sealed orders, but the invasion was postponed because of the weather, so we were all on edge.“Then at about four the next morning, one of the Wrens who had been on duty came rushing round all of our ­bedrooms, saying, ‘It’s started, it’s started!’“We got dressed and went out on top of the clf, but there was nothing you could see from where we were.“There was always a lot of shelling of Dover – which was known as Hellfire Corner.They shelled the town and also tried to hit these convoys that passed by right underneath the clf.“We saw one little ship hit directly by a shell and it exploded and caught fire. That was very sad.”Patricia added: “My st birthday was a week after D-Day and I was very unsure whether we would be able to celebrate but we did.“Our friends came to our Wrens’ ­station and we had a proper party.”After the war, Patricia became a BBC producer, working on The Sky At Night.She said: “I still keep in touch with two of my ­colleagues, both well into their nineties, and we did go back to Dover last spring for our firstto our station on top of the clf.“The house is now a luxury hotel – slightly dferent inside from when it was full of radio sets and bunks.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their task is to capture two vital bridges at Ranville and Bénouville and cut off Hitler’s SS Panzer isions which could threaten the ­invasion.On the way, Cockney Infantryman Wally Parr, , leads the singing with Abby, Abby, My Boy, while Private Willy Gray wishes he hadn’t drunk so much tea and rum before take-off.The men gently tease their leader, Major John Howard, about his airsickness – askinghis ­stomach is OK. Howard laughs it off.With the towlines cast off, the first of three gliders descends in the darkness.Landing is so rough that Parr and his comrades are knocked unconscious and the pilots are thrown through the windscreen.They come to after a few ­minutes and spot the bridges through the plane’s portholes.They are less than  metres from their target – and the second and third gliders arrive ­seconds later.Eighteen-year-old Private Helmut Roemer – guarding BenouvilleBridge on the Caen canal in Normandy – has been expecting a quiet night.He hears a “swishing noise” and suddenly finds himself facing  British paratroopers with blackened faces who open fire – the first ­German soldier to face the Allied invasion.He runs for his le. Roemer surrenders the next day after cowering under bushes.Around six minutes later, ­Lieutenant Den Brotheridge, , leads the charge across the bridge.A random flare lights up his ­position, and he is hit in the neck by machine gun fire – the first Allied soldier to die in action.Wally Parr runs to his side and realises “Denny” has died after just minutes of action. Brotheridge’s only child, Margaret, is born two weeks later.Read the remarkable stories of the ing veterans from our superb souvenir pulloutGerman General Erich Marcks receives an alarming phone call at Corps headquarters in Saint-Lo.The commander of the German th Division in Caen has received reports that paratroopers have landed in the area.American paratroopers are dropping in and around the strategically important town of Sainte Mere-Eglise on the main road to Cherbourg.Around , regroup close to the town with the intention of capturing it from its Nazi occupiers. After a few hours of fighting it becomes the first town in France to be liberated.However, some paratroopers never make it this far. They are dropped at the wrong location and drown in the deliberately flooded countryside before they can offload their heavy kit.Among those fighting is the youngest soldier to land in Normandy – -year-old Private Robert Johns, serving with the Parachute Regiment.He has run away from home aged  and joined up. It is only after he is killed by a sniper weeks later his ­comrades discover his age.Allied warships open fire on the German defences along the Normandy coast.Commandos have been advancing inland on bicycles to relieve the airborne ision fighting at the bridges.They find a badly wounded paratrooper on the way – and he’s not in a good mood. “Where the f*** have you been ” he demands.At am, Paratrooper Pte Emile Corteil and his army dog Glen – a German shepherd – have landed amid fierce fire on the Allies’ left flank.As they make their way along a country lane to join the rest of their comrades, they are mistaken for German by an RAF Typhoon fighter-bomber – and killed instantly, side by side, as they were in le.Corteil and Glen are later ­buried together – and Glen’s name inscribed on their joint grave.The battleship HMS Warspite fires a broadside – the starting signal for the British and Canadian assault on Juno, Sword and Gold Beaches.GENERAL Field Marshall Bernard “Monty” ­Montgomery ­commanded all ground forces during the ­Normandy invasion.Eisenhower respected the -year-old hero of El ­Alamein, but many American ­critics blamed him for the high casualty rate on June ­, .D-Day expert Col Jeremy Green says: “The campaign chewed up lives with terrible remorselessness.“Normandy became a war of attrition where you had a one-in-seven chance of surviving two weeksyou were an infantry platoon commander.“The Americans have not got over a -year hissy fit about Monty, who was a truly great general.“The real truth of Normandy is that the forces of a mighty coalition entered the continent of Europe and struck a telling blow at its occupiers.“They deserve our gratitude.”American soldiers land on Utah and Omaha Beaches, facing waves of machine gun fire from German forces. Many of the troops are now powerless, leaderless and scared.Survivors who have made it to the top of the beach are huddling together, watching dead and dying comrades.Some tanks have made it ashore and are shooting at ­German positions.Commandos land at Sword Beach, led by the flamboyant Scottish ­aristocrat Lord Lovat.With his personal piper Bill Millin by his side, playing Road To The Isles, Lovat leads his men through the heavy enemy fire.He later recalled with relish: “They moved like a kne through enemy butter.”In total, , troops have crossed the Channel destined for five target beaches – Utah and Omaha for US forces, and Gold, Juno and Sword for the Brits.Captain Douglas Render is surprised to find himself in Normandy. The day before, he was ordered to oversee the loading of tanks on to a landing craft. He said: “The next thing I knew, the ship was at sea.”As the craft arrives at Gold Beach, the front loading  lowers and the first tank drives off – but vanishes in an unseen underwater trench and sinks with the loss of all crew.The seas are rough and infantryman Robert Coupe, landing on Sword Beach, is so relieved to be on dry land that the enemy fire doesn’t bother him.The meat stew rations that the troops have eaten back in Britain don’t help the nausea. He said: “We were all so seasick.“I didn’t care whether I got shot or not. I just wanted to get off that landing craft and get my feet on the ground.“The Navy boys brought us as close to the beach as they could and then we waded to shore with water up to our armpits.”The dire situation on “Bloody Omaha” Beach – which saw , US troops killed or wounded on D-Day – improves as Allied ships come in close to shore and can attack ­German positions at point-blank range.General of the US Army Omar Nelson Bradley, who has considered abandoning the assault on Omaha, receives a message that “things look better”.Weary paratroopers who have been fighting for hours inland at the bridges believe they can hear the unlikely sound of bagpipes in the distance.They tell their comrades, but are told they are simply hearing things. The bagpipes – above the sound of gunfire – appear to be getting louder.Suddenly Lord Lovat’s piper appears – with reinforcements behind him.GENERAL Dwight D Eisenhower was the man who made the final decision to secretly send in the biggest invasion armada the world has ever seen.Known as “Ike”, the then -year-old Supreme ­Commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force ­postponed D-Day on June  for  hours because of bad weather.The next day, despite choppy seas, he was told the conditions “were probably sufficient” to go ahead.With time running out, just after am on Tuesday June , , Eisenhower decided: “OK, we’ll go for it.”Later, Ike stood on the clfs above Portsmouth and watched the aircraft and ships set off on what he would later call The Great Crusade.In his wallet was a handwritten note he had prepared in case it failed: “If any blame or fault attaches to the attempt, it is mine alone.”After ceaseless heavy fighting, the ­commandos have reached the bridges to finally help the beleaguered paratroopers.Lord Lovat, leading the way, shakes Major John Howard calmly by the hand and apologises politely for being two-and-a-half minutes late.The scene is later immortalised in the  Hollywood movie The ­Longest Day.At midday UK time, Prime Minister Winston Churchill addresses the House of Commons.He tells MPs: “During the night and the early hours of this morning the first of the series of landings in force upon the European continent has taken place.”At around the same time, Adolf Hitler holds his daily military conference at his headquarters in the Baian Alps.In a rather upbeat mood, he thinks the weather is on the ­Germans’ side. Hitler is convinced that the Allies will be driven back into the sea on the following day.All five landing beaches are now crowded with activity as thousands more ­soldiers come ashore.The wounded are receiving treatment amid the wreckage of the morning’s fierce fighting.Allied planes concentrate bombing runs on German reinforcements around Caen because enemy tanks and infantry there are threatening the Allied beach-head.The first sections of two Mulberry prefabricated portable harbours for unloading cargo on the target beaches head across the Channel.A German armoured Panzer ­ision attacks British forces in a pitched battle between Juno and Sword landing zones.The British th Division, which landed at Gold Beach, is still three miles from retaking Bayeux but has joined up with Canadian forces, who landed at Juno.As night approaches, fighting ­continues and more troops arrive by glider. More than , Allied troops are now ashore along  miles of beach but it will be days before all five beaches are linked up.A few German units are still defending the beaches, but the invasion has been a success.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We will mostly likely have to delay flight until morningthis happens.”The messages were sent in an internal server for employees.The flight attendants are understood to have decided to stay on the flight – despite working longer hours than they should have.But they complained to Delta bosses and said they would be “tired and hungry”.An attendant listed as “flight leader” voiced her complaints in correspondence seen by Huffpost.“Since we are deciding to stay although y’all are trying to trap us on the plane, and now our layover has been shortened and we will be past our duty day, hungry and tired. It would be nice to have a deadhead at some point tomorrow.”A ‘deadhead’ is a crew member flying in a passenger seat. They are not a part of the working crew and are often being repositioned by the airline.A later message said: “We are ready to walk literally, Doing the operation a huge favour.”Delta is following up with the team involved to address the situation.“Operating an airline is a team effort and the guidance shared in this exchange does not reflect the respect and collaboration we expect of our employees when making operational decisions,” a spokesperson told SunOnline.“Delta’s unique culture is built on supporting one another and that didn’t happen in this case. We have followed up directly with the team members involved to address this situation.”Delta said that the door on the flight was opened after the maintenance work was resolved and flight attendants could have walked outthey wanted to.The flight attendants received additional pay for working longer hours."},{"url":null,"title":"d day veterans anniversary jump","story":"Harry Read, , and John Hutton, , will take off from Duxford, Cambs, in a Dakota aircraft before making tandem jumps over Sannerville.The great-great-grandfather said the forthcoming descent - after which he will visit fallen comrades in cemeteries - will be tinged with sadness.Former Royal Signaller Harry, of Bournemouth, said: “In my heart I’ll be thinking of my mates.”Mr Read said: I will enjoy the jump.

Katie Bourne was diagnosed with the deadly disease in February and was told that, without treatment, she would only survive about  months. Months before she had visited the doctors reporting her concerns but she was too young for a smear test and doctors initially diagnosed her with Crohnaposs disease.But the -year-old, halfway through her chemotherapy, is remaining positive about her future, reports Teesside Live.   She is determined to live the rest of her le - however long it may be - to the fullest, making special memories with those closest to her. Top of the list is marrying her partner of four years Leighanne Prior. The couple had planned to get hitched in Las Vegas within the next few years. But following Katieaposs diagnosis, they agreed to bring the date forward and will wed in July at Middlesbrough Registry Office. This will be followed by a dream honeymoon in the Males in January. On her breaks from treatment, Katie has enjoyed several days away and short breaks.. She recently spent a weekend away with Leighanne in Newcastle where the pair enjoyed relaxing spa treatments and drinks on the town. Katie is still compiling her list of ambitions and laughed when she revealed one of them is to finish all the Real Housewives series!

I want to make memories with my nephew Jackson - heaposs my best friend - and I canapost wait to meet my baby niece who is due on July , she said.    Iaposm going to Scarborough with Jackson and Leighanne for two nights and then we have our hen weekend so weaposre really looking forward to that. To be honest the only day I feel really down is the day before my chemotherapy. I have a little bit of a wobble but I donapost think about it all the time. I can go days without thinking about it. And I have a massive support system - we have a party of people at each chemo session! But despite staying positive about the future, Katie does get frustrated - as she believes her cancer should have been detected earlier. NHS England and the Clinical Commissioning Group is looking into Katieaposs case. A spokesman for the CCG said they cannot comment at this time as an investigation is being carried out.    She said her symptoms had pointed towards cervical cancer but referrals for smears were turned down because of her age. Women are invited for cervical screening from ages  to . Cervical screening is not recommended for anyone under  due to a belief that it could lead to unnecessary treatment for younger women. Katie believes the minimum age should be lowered to save the lives of more young women. She said she started to experience stomach pains in July last year and went to the doctors in the November. They took some swabs and said I was booked in for a smear, she said. But when I went back they said they werenapost going to do the smear and I was diagnosed with Crohnaposs Disease. The pain never went with the medication they gave me for that. My oncologist has said I never had anything wrong with my bowel or I wouldnapost have been able to go on this type of chemotherapy.    In February, Katie collapsed in pain at Next where she works and spent three nights in hospital. Because of my age I was still declined a smear and when the pains went they sent me home, she said. My GP had sent two gynae referrals in the December and January but both were declined. All my symptoms have always been the same. And when I Googled them they always brought up cervical cancer. The third referral was accepted, she said, and the results of a subsequent smear and scan brought Katieaposs world crashing down. She was told she had stage three cancer which had spread to both sides of her pelvis. When they said cervical cancer I canapost remember anything after. I just remember getting home, she said. It was all a blur. So when the oncologist later ran through it all with me I thought aposI donapost want to have this conversation againapos so I made sure I took everything in and understood it all. Chemotherapy treatment began mid-April and she will undergo six sessions. I was told the prognosis was  months but that is without treatment, she said. As everybody is dferent they canapost really say.  I could take fantastically to the treatment or it might not work. So each scan will tell us more.   Katie and Leighanne met four years ago through friends at a Halloween party.Leighanne has taken time off work to cope with the news and take care of her partner.

A report by the Sun claimed Andrew and Fergie are back in a romantic relationship that friends say makes them friends with benefits.Neither is dating or pursuing anyone  romantically, the report claims. It is said Prince Philip has removed his objection to the relationship, with friends saying he doesnapost care any more, the report added. But Charles is adamantly opposed to the idea of Fergie becoming a royal again and believes she will look for ways to make money off her royal position, it is claimed.  A royal source claimed: Charles is not OK with Fergie. He can’t stand her in reality. “He thinks she’s brought embarrassment to the Royal Family in the past and his relationship with his brother has been strained as a result. There’s so much baggage because he feels she sided with Diana over Camilla all those years ago. However, another royal source denied the claims, telling : It is not correct to say thatare back together. Fergie recently joined Andrew on a trip to Bahrain with daughter Beatrice and her boyfriend, property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, fuelling rumours that their romance was back on. However, the Duchess of York has denied claims that sheaposs back with her ex-husband.  Her spokesman said: “The Duke and Duchess remain good friends as they have been for many years, and nothing has changed.” A spokesperson for Andrew declined to comment at the time. The Queen, meanwhile, has a personal relationship with Fergie, inviting her to Balmoral for summer visits. Fergie has also told recently how she joins Her Majesty for tea at Ascot and Windsor Castle.She also attended  Prince Harry  and Meghan Markleaposs wedding in May last year. However, she doesnapost get an invite to the Queenaposs estate in Sandringham, Norfolk, when Beatrice and Eugenie join their father and the rest of the royals for Christmas.The Duchess of York landed in the  Royal Familyaposs  bad books as the couple went through a dramatic and public separation in  before orcing in .The scandal led to her being shunned for years before relations began to thaw as their children grew older. Behind it all, Sarah and Andrew have remained close and they reside together at Royal Lodge in Windsor. Rumours of a reconciliation have continued to follow the couple and Fergie revealed in November last year that people keep asking herthey will remarry. She said at the time that she and Andrew were happy with the way we are right now and the happiest orced couple in the world.

The -year-old graduated with a first-class degree in international business strategy in  but felt claims in the universityaposs prospectus that it was a aposrenowned centre of excellenceapos that offered a aposhigh quality of teachingapos were untrue. Anglia Ruskin University, which has campuses in Chelmsford, Cambridge and London, strongly disputed her allegations.    But they have now agreed to pay her a £, settlement plus £, towards her legal fees. She had been seeking £, in damages plus her legal fees. Experts believe that her success could tempt others who are unhappy with the quality of teaching they received at university to take legal action. Ms Wong, who now lives in Hong Kong, told The Sunday : The payout means this is a victory for me, despite the university strenuously fighting my case and denying any responsibility.apos She added: In light of this settlement I think universities should be careful about what they say in prospectuses. I think they often make promises which they know will never materialise or are simply not true.    Speaking ahead of the settlement last year, she said: Although I graduated with a First Class degree in , it is a Mickey Mouse degree. I hope that bringing this case will set a precedent so that students can get value for money, andthey donapost they get compensated. She argued that it had proved useless in her efforts to secure aposa rewarding job with prospectsapos. Anglia Ruskin, which holds a mid-ranking in UK university league tables, said that because the settlement was out of court, nothing had been proved in law. A spokesman said: Ms Wongaposs longstanding litigation... has been settled at the instruction of our insurers to draw a line under these matters and to prevent a further escalation of their legal costs. The claims were wholly without merit and resulted in cost orders made against Ms Wong by the Central London County Court on two occasions. In , the Advertising Standards Authority upheld complaints against six universities – Leicester, East Anglia, Strathclyde, Falmouth, Teesside and the University of West London.  It said that universities had to be able to prove claims that they made about their status.

A post mortem examination found no signs of congenital abnormality or infection, with doctors ruling her mumaposs use of anti-depressant during pregnancy unlikely the cause.    Senior Coroner for Lincolnshire Timothy Brennand said that none of a number of theoretically possible potential natural and unnatural causes of death could be established on the balance of probabilities. Mr Brennand, who reached an open conclusion, said: The full extent of options as to the medical cause of death is limited by the fact that the placenta had been removed. United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust will respond in  days setting out a programme of responses following a serious incident review where a number of suboptimal findings had been made. Mum Sharna said in a statement read to the inquest that she had many unanswered questions. She said: I want to find out who was watching my daughter. Why did no-one find her [unresponsive] before. We were told she was the healthiest and fittest baby in ICU but she needed to be there because she was premature. She added: I found it extremely hard to cope after losing Betsy. I keep thinking that one day the door will open and there will be Betsy. I will never ever get over losing our baby.  Itaposs not something any parent should have to endure. A spokesman for United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust said: “We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family of Betsy Teft.

Researchers travelled theof the loch and took water samples from three dferent depths. The scientists collected DNA left by creatures from their skin, scales, feathers, fur and faeces. Samples were then sent to labs in New Zealand, Australia, Denmark, and France to be analysed. Professor Neil Gemmell of the University of Otago, New Zealand, said the results were “surprising”. He is an expert in genomics, ecology, population, conservation and evolutionary biology.    The professor says he hopes full details of the study’s findings will be released next month. But he hinted that one of four popular theories about Nessie ‘might’ be correct. One is that the monster is a long-necked plesiosaur that survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct. Another more likely explanation is that Nessie is in fact a sturgeon or giant catfish living in the loch. Prof Gemmell said: “Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising. “What weaposll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in some level of detail. “Weaposve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say arenapost right and one of them might be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"man slept over 2000 women","story":"NewsMan slept with over , women as he battled sex, drugs and alcohol addictionJames Davenport from Salford is producing a film about his le called The Making of an AddictShareByMilo Boyd:,  JUN NewsShinny has battled with booze, drug and sex addiction \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA reformed drug dealer who has slept with , women has spoken candidly about his battles with addiction. James Davenport is a man who threw himself into his passions. The former boxer, better known as Shinny, calculated that he slept with , women from the age of  to . Whether it was girlfriends, one night stands or prostitutes, the -year-oldaposs appetite for sex was near intiatbale. But it wasnapost enough.    Alcohol, drugs, sex - anything. The quick, instant gratication was what I wanted, the Salford man said. “From the age of about  or  when I went fully into sex, up until I was about , I calculated that I probably slept with about , women. “I picked up prostitutes, women from clubs, anywhere. I could have between five and  women over the course of a weekend. But it wasn’t enough. “I even started questioning my own sexuality at one point.” Shinnyaposs appetite for sex and alcohol started when he was just ten-years-old. “I would manipulate older girls to perform sex acts on me,” he said. “I was very mature at an early age, my thinking was like a teenager. I knew it was wrong, but it excited me. I couldn’t help myself. “Addicts become experts at manipulating and we will do anything to get what we want. For me it was simple to manipulate a girl older than me and convince her it was OK to do what we were doing.    “The alcoholism started around the same age. I remember drinking alcohol at my grandparents. It was some form of lager in a tap barrel in their spare room. I loved the way it made me feel.” Shinny can pinpoint his compulsive behaviour back to when he was seven and experienced addiction for the first time. “I used to steal it and drink it out of the bottle,” remembered Shinny, who now hosts a recovery talk show in Youtube. “With vinegar, I think I got a kick from it, a bit like with a chilli. “I also remember drinking out of a dirty puddle, and have only recently found out, during my recovery, that it was also part of the addiction. As I drank it I remember thinking - I have made my own decision to do that and no one knows what I’ve done. “Along with that my behaviour was up the wall. I used to wet the bed and was scared of the dark when I was younger. I always felt like an outsider looking in. Through my addictions and behaviour I was trying to escape my own thinking.” By high school Shinny - who also struggled with bulimia for  years - was snfing aerosols, smoking weed and doing harder drugs.    He would go on to sell drugs and become involved with Salford gangs. Sex, drugs, rock and roll, violence and criminal activity was my le,” he said. “Alcoholism has nothing to do with alcohol as such, it’s the feeling that it gives you. Anything that excites me - Iaposm in. “Later on I became involved in criminal activity. I wanted to be the most successful, hardest drug dealer. And the most handsome. I can go to bed thinking about myself, dream about myself and wake up thinking about myself. Addicts are very self-obsessed people.”    Shinny believes some of his issues stemmed from his relationship with his alcoholic father, who wasnapost present during large parts of his upbringing. He had the chance to forgive him for his absence for he died seven years ago. The father of two hit rock bottom when he began planning out his suicide, only to pull himself back from the edge by thinking of his eight and -year-old children. “I planned how I was going to do it, and how. It’s so sad to think that it can get that dark. When my partner left and I could not be with my children anymore, that was what I needed to sort myself out. “I went into detox in . Since then I have had one relapse, but as of June , I will be two years clean.” Despite a relapse in , Shinny has turned his le around with the help of Alcoholics Anonymous’ -step programme, and the support of his partner Nicole Evans. Now two years clean he has used his experience to help educate people about addiction through a documentary called aposThe Making of an Addictapos.   A -minute teaser of the biopic, directed by Chris Green, was screened Saturday morning at HOME and is available to view on Shinnyaposs official Facebook page.He now aims to make the full movie, which he then hopes to take round schools as an education tool for young people. “I want this film to be the new Kes, I want it to be an education to children in schools,” he explained, talking of the  film by Ken Loach. “I have channeled my addictions into getting well and helping others, and want to show others that it can be done. If it wasn’t for my girlfriend Nicole I wouldn’t be where I am today. She’s a massive part of my le. “This disease is always going to be there. You can either wallow in it or fight. My first thought in the morning is always negative, but I quickly change that into a positive and pray to a higher power greater than me to keep me clean and sober for one more day. “It’s a  hour reprieve.

As the children of migrants, what do they think about the impact of immigration  “I think it’s quite good,” suggests Karina. “We have a lot more cultures now.” Looking back down the wrong end of the telescope, they seem shocked I had to wait until I was  to vote and that  was the second EU referendum, after we voted nearly two to one in  to stay in the then Common Market.    It is disarming to see how young people come fresh to le. They’re both sensitive people, “and with sensitivity comes understanding,” says Karina. And where would they like to be in  years  We’re talking in the busy Daily Mirror newsroom, which appeals to them. Yasmeen says: “I’d like to write about mental health. It’s been neglected.” Pretty soon my half-hour is up, and I ask them to ask me a question. Yasmeen asks: “What political party do you support ” That’s easy. I’m Labour, old Labour in fact, but not a Corbynista. Karina asks what I think about today’s society. That’s harder to answer, but I believe the Thatcherite ­revolution atomised society, exalting ­iniduality over collective identity. Talking across almost  years of experience, it’s not easy to express this without sounding preachy at best and arrogant at worst. But we must try. We can’t expect young people to respect uswe don’t respect them and listen to their views. Schools should give students a chance to hear it from the old nag’s mouth, so to speak.at Mirror BritainTalks "},{"url":null,"title":"smiling boy one month help","story":"NewsSmiling boy has one month to get help in US before organs failMilo Poblocki from County Meath in the Republic of Ireland is hoping to fly out to Philadelphia in the US for treatmentShareCommentsByLouise WalshMilo Boyd:,  JUN NewsMilo Poblocki is known around town as the boy that keeps smiling\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe family of a little boy with a le limiting condition are fighting to get him an operation in the US before his organs shut down. Doctors have told Milo Poblocki that he has just a month to get treatment for his le limiting condition. Mum Alicia Sokolowska, , and dad Eric Poblocki, , are desperately trying to raise £, to take the eight-year-old to Philadelphia for an appointment at the Children’s University Hospital on July .So far they have raised half the sum, the Irish Mirror reported.Postponing the consultation is not an option for Milo, his mum said, because progressive Mitochondrial disease and Leigh Syndrome have taken a lot of my son already.”    Little Milo, from Kells in County Meath, Republic of Ireland, cannot walk, talk, move or sit but is known around the town as the little boy who is always smiling, despite being in constant pain. Mitochondria create % of energy needed by the body to sustain le and support growth. If they fail less energy is created in the cell, causing cell injury and even death. “Milo is a huge warrior. Since he was born, he’s been struggling with a le-limiting condition that has taken a lot of him away already,” said Alicia.    “His organs and body systems are slowly shutting down. He is also in constant pain and vomits so much that he has to have a gastric vent and drain. “He is in a wheelchair and has lost the ability to talk and eat himself. He has to be fed through a special pump. “This disease affects everything from temperature to cardiac regulation and his metabolism. It kills more kids in early childhood than any cancer. “There is no cure and doctors told us that he would deteriorate after the age of six when his large organs of his brain and stomach would start shutting down first.    “For those of you who have a child that you would do anything for, think about the prospect that they may not be able to survive to learn what le is or how beautul it is. It’s frightening.” Despite the pain he is in Milo keeps smiling and manages to go to school three times a week. “He tries to smile every day and send around his enormous and amazing positive energy that infects everyone around him, Alicia continued. The disease hasn’t yet robbed him of his smile.”    If the family manage to get Milo out to the US he will receive experimental treatment which has stalled the conditionaposs progression in some children. The insertion of a special cocktail of vitamins and supplements has allowed some children to walk, talk and eat independently again. “My baby is a prisoner in his own body, but could be liberated thanks to proper treatment and therapy, she continued. We have a chance in Philadelphia and we have to give Milo that chance.    “We can’t wait another year. Every minute he gets worse and his immune system decreases which means he gets bad infections and won’t be fit to be accepted. “We have to act quickly as Milo’s organs are slowly breaking down. The date of the first consultation is set for July th and the entire amount must be paid in full before arrival. “We need the help of people. So many have already done so much and we are so grateful but we are pleading for any help to get remaining funds before July.To view the fundraising page for Milo click here."},{"url":null,"title":"students very rude message donald","story":"NewsStudents VERY rude message for Donald Trump on Stansted flightpath ahead of visitThe President of the United States will see the phallic greetinghe looks out of Air Force OneShareCommentsByMilo Boyd:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video donald-trump-s-what-happened-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe President of the United States will be welcomed to the UK by an enormous penis mowed into a field.

In a field not far from the airport an outline of a penis with the words oi Trump can be clearly seen from above. A separate, nearby field bares the words aposclimate change is realapos beneath a large polar bear.    The message is the inspired work of Bishops Stortford A Level Art student and Upcycling entrepreneur Ollie Nancarrow. “Donald Trump and his denial of climate change are not welcome, he said. “I want him to be fully aware of that when he flies in to Stansted tomorrow.”    Mr Trump has previously shown he is not above a immature penis reference, jovially claiming he is well endowed in a  speech. The climate issue may be more of a sticking point however. In May the UK government declared a climate emergency following two intense weeks of protesting by Extinction Rebellion. While the coalition has been accused of mincing words but not taking action in the month since - Friday seeing the most ever planes flying in UK airspace for example - Mr Trumpaposs unabashed opposition to climate change may rankle.    He has openly mocked renewable energy, promoted the controversial and still highly polluting clean coal industry and decided to pull the USA out of the Paris Climate Accord. It is unlikely flying in his , person entourage along with two identical limousines tomorrow will do much for the Presidentaposs green credentials.

The woman, only identied as Kate, kicked the men out onto the street at am after claiming she felt aposunsafeapos in her home, according to one of the guests, Meshach Cisero. Mr Cisero, who is owner and executive chef of The Cage Bird in Washington D.C, shared a video of her standing over one of the men as he was packing his bag.We arrived to our @Airbnb, and we were harassed several times before being thrown out at  am, Cisero said on Instagram . Her reasonings were because she felt unsafe, we were going to steal and destroy her property, and then told us to “Get the f*** out of her house immediately! We cooperated and began to pack our things to leave. She is also seen in the clip telling them they were not allowed to bring in pets just before a dog is seen running into the shot - however it is not clearthe animal belongs to the men. The clip goes on to show Kate arguing with Mr Cisero about how many the space can accommodate, with the host asserting that it says four.  It says four and a couch, so thataposs five. You have that on your Airbnb description the chef declares.  Kate retorts: Which monkey is going to stay on the couch  prompting the men to yell at her: Your mum. The group start to question whether she actually said that as she quickly turns around and heads downstairs.  Mr Cisero, three friends and his twin brother had checked into the apartment in Manhattanaposs Upper East Side last night shortly before the row erupted. He claimed Kate asked them to leave so they started gathering their things to leave. But he claims that as they were packing, she burst into their room. They asked her to respect their privacy - as one of them had just got out of the shower - but she continued to film, he said.  Cisero added: She became so angry, rude, and disrespectful that we had to call @NYPD because we weren’t sureshe’d attack us while trying to leave. In the video Kate is seen standing over the group telling them they had five minutes to get out and said she would wait for the police here before asking them to come o the first floor. They then apologised for being loud but she replied: After I asked you three times.. It said no pets and no parties. The chef concluded the post stating that the group were able to find a hotel and had somewhere to sleep for the night. Mr Ciseroaposs post on Twitter quickly went viral and Airbnb responded on the thread to share that they were apossorryapos about the incident.An Airbnb spokesperson said: The language used in this video is unacceptable and has no place in the Airbnb community. We have a strict nondiscrimination policy, which we are enforcing to remove the host from our . We are supporting Mr. Cisero and his friends in getting them a new place to stay through our Open Doors policy. We’re thankful to them for bringing this to our attention so we could take action. Mr Cisero later posted: I am glad that we can shed light on this and hold these people accountable, we can hold our hostaccountable and we can hold Airbnb accountable for these services that they offer us but are not living up to our expectationsapos he said in the video. I am also placing myself in the shoes of what could potentially be someoneaposs little sister or brother, or someone who doesnapost have the means to figure out their situation right away and get out of it.

Trent, who works at Xero Australia shared his little trick while speaking on the business podcast The Venture with entrepreneur Lambros Photios. He said: I will always take you for a walk down to one of our kitchens and somehow you always end up walking away with a drink.  Then we take that back, have our interview, and one of the things I’m always looking for at the end of the interview is, does the person doing the interview want to take that empty cup back to the kitchen  You can develop skills, you can gain knowledge and experience but it really does come down to attitude, and the attitude that we talk a lot about is the concept of aposwash your coffee cupapos.  And he claims that this trick works, and the kitchens in their office are always very clean. He goes on: If you come into the office one day inside Xero, you’ll see the kitchens are almost always clean and sparkling and it’s very much off that concept of wash your coffee cup. It’s really just making sure that they’re actually going to fit into the culture inside Xero, and really take on everything that they should be doing.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

Many visitors also took a seat around the #have-a-go# table to learn more and make their own pompom caterpillar or plant, take up a bit of cross stitch or find out about the art of decoupage – a staple of the immensely popular activity of upcycling, while others took advantage of the opportunity to sit outside the hall enjoying delicious home-made cakes washed down with tea or coffee.Co-organiser Ruth Tott commented: #The idea of the craft day just grew and grew, with one thing leading to another. One of the many fun attractions, our popular ‘scarecrow’ knitter, came about by accident after an old rusty garden chair was donated then renovated with the aid of brightly-coloured spray paint, after which it was simply crying out for a body to sit on it.#Plans are already afoot for next year’s event – surely a must following such a success.Another one of the organisers, Val Whale, added: #We’re holding a post-mortem with the craft group members this week to discuss what worked, what didn’t work, and what we can do better next year.#Many from the community have already pledged their support, showing how crafting is so much more than just a hobby and can help forge friendships as well as passing on what can become a lelong skill.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

The weather was a challenge in itself due to the bitter cold, but the young people rose to the challenge and coped admirably.The climax of the weekend was the presentation of six Gold Chief Scout Awards to group members who have been working hard for four years to gain the highest achievement possible for a Scout. All six Scouts who gained the award have now started their careers in the Explorer section of the group.In late March members of the Scout and Explorer section joined with the Heart of Argyll Wildle Organisation to undertake an Earth Hour Camp.

The car had a new engine and gearbox and the pair aimed to spend the day testing and setting up the new car.After setting a second-fastest time through stage four # only four seconds from Greg#s father Alistair # they were looking for a promising finish. Going into the final stage they had to find five seconds to secure third overall. Their rival had, however, spun only two corners from the start line, leaving Inglis and Parker to power through the finish line to third overall. This meant that the half of the podium was made up of members of the Inglis family, as Alistair and Colin came home with first place.The Fell Motorsport team of George and Lois Fell from Campbeltown were back after  months of preparing their immaculate new Clio.

That was the purpose of a meeting of farmers, teachers and others interested in the countryside on May .Organised for the Edinburgh-based charity by the local branch of NFU Scotland, -plus people came along to the Inveraray Inn on a bright, chilly May evening.Making the journey west to spread the word were RHET chairman George Lawrie and executive officer Katrina Barclay, who outlined the structure and potential benefits of RHET.With its headquarters at Ingliston, RHET acts as an umbrella body, co-ordinating the existing dozen Countryside Initiatives around Scotland . Each CI is set up as a charity in its own right, with help and support from Ingliston.The point of each regional CI is to bring children closer to farming, forestry, aquaculture and other rural industries.Working with partners, the charity would deliver learning opportunities for young people aged three to  around the Scottish agricultural environment and the countryside.Examples of the activities undertaken by RHET include farm visits for schools classroom speaker talks by volunteer farmers providing free educational resource materials for schools outdoor education events across Scotland competitions and projects for schools and training farmers and teachers in the delivery of information relating to food and farming.Regional CIs are supported by co-ordinators, who will liaise with schools and nurseries, organise visits, carry out health and safety checks and make sure everything is in place for events like farm visits.Present at the meeting was Argyll and Bute Council#s Head of Education Anne Paterson.#I am really encouraged to hear about the work of RHET,# said Mrs Paterson.Emphasising the the importance placed on outdoor education by the local authority, she added: #We have a good history of farm visits in Argyll and Bute, but on a more informal basis. As an education service we encourage schools to be outdoors.Mrs Paterson concluded: #We are really keen to make it happen and to work in partnership with RHET.#George Lawrie, who has been involved with RHET for around  years, said: #What I find most rewarding in working with the young people is just seeing the smiles on their faces.#If you want to find out more, whether as a farmer crofter, education provider or are involved in any other land use or rural industry, contact Lucy Sumsion by email at lucy.sumsion@nfus.org.uk to express an interest.PIC:From left: NFUS Argyll and the Islands region chairnman John Dickson with George Lawrie and Katrina Barclay of Royal Highland Education Trust. _aRHETmeetingKatrina Barclay addresses the sizeable audience in the Inveraray Inn as George Lawrie looks on. _aRHETmeeting"},{"url":null,"title":"fynefest celebrates turning 10 with a beer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFyneFest s for , celebrating hitting double figures with as much flair as ever.Beer, food and music: what more could anyone ask for  And there#s going to be plenty of each at this unique event, held over four days from Friday May .As usual, the field will be filled with trucks serving everything from pizza to curry and cupcakes.

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

brother as part of a Preston Athletic Youth FC group that had travelled to the park in Yorkshire for a weekend football tournament.However, as reported in last weekrsquos Courier, the entire group of  people were asked to leave a day early after several incidents involving adults and young players.Flamingo Land took the decision to evict the group after a couplersquos domestic altercation at the

park.The family had made the trip south as Sophiersquos brother Kaden, , was playing in the May - football tournament.Mr Carruthers said that he, along with most of the group, woke up on the Sunday morning totally unaware of the events of the previous evening which resulted in the group not allowed to remain at the park, where they were due to stay another night, after their football tournament at nearby sports pitches ended.ldquoIt was all very upsetting, he said.ldquoWe didnrsquot really know what was going on. To kick everyone out after a few incidents seems to me really unfair.ldquoThere were young kids there who were very upset and humiliated.ldquoAs I understand it, the people responsible for what happened had offered to leave so that the rest of us could stay. It seemed cruel to kick every single one of us out.ldquoWe were on the bus when members of the security team came on and cut the childrenrsquos wristbands off [for entry to the park] which was really unnecessary.ldquoMy daughter was crying, it was disgusting behaviour.ldquoWhen it came time for us to leave after packing up our stuff, we had to walk to the place of pick-up and wait for the buses, watched by security guards the whole way.ldquoWhen we got to the place we were getting picked up from, we then found out that they werenrsquot going to allow the buses into the park. My daughter had her walker with her instead of her chair and was already struggling at how far she had had to travel there was no way they could ask her to walk another fair distance to the buses.ldquoIt was after what felt like ages, and I had kicked up a bit of a fuss, they finally let the buses come down to us to collect us.

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship. The human race isnrsquot over yet."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9918363.jpg?type=article-full","title":"a-guide-to-some-of-scotlands-best-beer-gardens","story":"Relaxing with a cold drink and enjoying the sunrsquos rays is a rare but welcome treat for us Scots.

Over the years we have tried to get the playability up but retain the enjoyment and the new hole has already proved tremendously popular with all the members.The total yardage for the par- course has reduced by eight yards to ,, while the standard scratch for all levels remains the same.Coupled with other initiatives such as rough reduction, the course changes have also helped Barassie to grow membership in these challenging times.The club, which was founded in  and the course finally laid as  holes in , now has a total membership of over ,.Claire Middleton, General Manager at Kilmarnock , added: ldquoWe are thrilled with the new par- th hole. Paul Kimber and his team managed not only to meet our budget and a tight schedule but, even more importantly, meet membersrsquo expectations.ldquoWe look forward to another great golfing season and our members and visitors enjoying the course changes.Barassie, which also boasts a -hole layout, counts former Amateur champion Gordon Sherry and fellow ex-Walker Cup winning players Jim Milligan and Jack McDonald among its current members.The club also offers improved facilities in the clubhouse and professionals shop, run by Gregor Howie.Visit the website to find out more.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Lochranza CentreWelcome to Arranrsquos oldest and youngest tourist attraction.The Vikings called Arran the mysterious Island, sometimes there, sometimes not depending on the weather.

Although results at Higher have fluctuated from year to year there has been a signicant overall increase in the proportion of pupils achieving Highers since , when the model was introduced.Nearly  per cent of school-leavers secured at least one Higher this year compared to  per cent six years ago and over the same period pupils achieving five or more Highers has risen from  per cent to  per cent.The schools approach puts an interesting spin on the current debate over whether CfE has led to a restriction in subject choice rather than the greater breadth that was promised.There has been much wringing of hands over a reduction in the number of National  qualications on offer in many schools, but the example of Hillhead demonstrates an approach which does just that, but makes sense for those pupils who will be judged primarily on their Highers.The current debate centres on the fact that under previous curriculum models pupils would routinely sit eight or nine Standard Grades in S before identying the five Highers they would take in S.As CfE was being designed, one of the questions posed was whether cramming for a repetitive cycle of examinations was a worthwhile pursuit. Did it prepare pupils with the skills required for a rapidly changing world and was it something pupils found meaningful, relevant or even enjoyable As a result, the so-called Broad General Educationwas designed for the first three years of secondary school, essentially delaying the start of study for formal qualications from S to S, but allowing pupils to develop a range of additional skills in a less pressured environment.What that has meant in practice for many schools is that pupils only have one year to study the National  and National  qualications that replaced Standard Grade, leading to a reduction in the overall number of subjects.The Scottish Parliaments education committee is currently holding an inquiry into the issue and has received evidence that appears to show a signicantly reduced choice, at least of traditional subjects.Figures from the Reform Scotland think tank show a majority of schools now only offer six subjects in the fourth year of secondary school. Others schools, with a dferent interpretation of the curriculum, are still offering eight or nine, although this usually means choosing subjects earlier than CfE envisaged.Chris Deerin, director of Reform Scotland, said: \"We are in real danger of opening up a new type of attainment gap in Scotland - one where children who are allowed to sit eight or nine National s or s will have a distinct advantage over those restricted to five or six.\"The Royal Society of Edinburgh is also concerned, arguing the impact of reduced subject choice is felt most keenly by learners who leave school at S with fewer qualications than previously might have been the case, typically those from more disadvantaged backgrounds.An RSE paper on subject choice added: \"Reduced course choice at S can also constrain learners options in S and S since it will be more dficult to progress to Higher level without the pre-requisite learning at National  level.\"With English and mathematics seen as essential, the narrowing means particular subjects are now in decline in S. Research by Professor Jim Scott, from Dundee University, identied these as German, French, art, drama, music, computing studies and some sciences.The Scottish Association of Geography Teachers is deeply troubled by the trend saying widespread narrowing of the curriculum has reduced choice for inidual pupils \"thus limiting their career opportunities too soon and restricting the opportunity to change career pathways further into the senior school\".However, John Swinney, the Education Secretary, argues in an interview in the Herald tomorrow that looking at one particular moment in the senior school experience is a mistake because CfE allows pupils to secure qualications and other skills and achievements in a more flexible way.\"Young people are remaining engaged with education and participating in education for longer than was the case when I was at school which is a very signicant change. Wherever I go I dont see a narrowing of choice in Scottish education. I see a blossoming of choice,\" he said.Mr Swinney also said he was relaxed about the dferent curriculum models adopted by schools, with the study of six subjects just as valid as nine, as long as the school had the support of pupils and parents.Nonetheless, curriculum and inspection body Education Scotland has concerns about schools which still have a focus on a traditional qualications structure. And they have gone further than most in suggesting that some subjects may not be relevant to some pupils.Gayle Gorman, Scotlands Chief Inspector of Education, said: \"The aim ... was to change the focus of study in the senior phase from the model that many teachers, parents and others will be familiar with.\"That may well mean young people taking fewer qualications, particularly at some levels ... and that the curriculum design may look dferent from school to school.\"We are still seeing some schools where the focus is on a one year qualications ladder, with a drive to the next batch of National , National , Higher or Advanced Highers, and too often in the traditional subjects that were studied by those of previous generations, but may not always be the best fit now within a st century skillset.\"Young people, preparing for a very dferent world of work than their parents or teachers, are telling us that there is still too much focus being placed on traditional qualications at the expense of more innovative pathways.\"The Educational Institute of Scotlandteaching union believes the structures in secondary are mostly unchanged, despite the introduction of CfE.An EIS statement said: \"While the qualications themselves have changed, the ways in which young people undertake them much too closely resemble the experiences of senior students a decade and a half ago.\"Indeed, it could be argued the current arrangement is poorer as the compression of qualications into one year rather than two has required a reduction in the number of subjects chosen and also a signicant time pressure in delivering these courses in a single year.\"Parents are also concerned. Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect, said they were aware of schools where pupils still chose subjects at the end of second year and began work on their National qualications in third year.She said: \"We are still pushing many youngsters through National  when they could be going straight to Higher. The flexibility of CfE in relation to dferent pathways rather than going through the assessments associated with National  and National  has not been embraced across the board.\"And Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, urged schools to embrace the idea of flexibility.She said: \"More and more of our young people are staying on for the full three years so the focus should be on the qualications that they leave with, not the order in which they sit them.\"There is no point in creating a mental health crisis in our young people, which we hear is happening, by making them just sit and learn things.\"Resolving the tension between specialists who see the quality and longevity of their subjects underpinned by formal qualications in S and beyond and those who argue for less pressure and more alternative choices is not easy.Mark Priestley, professor of education at Stirling University, believes a review of CfE is important to try and establish some fundamental principles about what schools should deliver.He said: \"Fundamentally, we need to consider the worth of qualications. The system as it currently stands tends to encourage an approach which is about passing exams rather than the state of being educated. Both are important, butwe over-focus on qualications then we are selling young people short.\"The controversy about the narrowing of subjects has been largely determined by what people think education should be, based on the way it used to be. At some stage we are going to have to review CfE to determine what schools are actually for.\"*See tomorrows Herald for the full interview with John Swinney."},{"url":null,"title":"swinney-to-announce-crackdown-on-nitrite-meat-after-herald-on-sunday-campaign","story":"Swinney is expected to back maximum legal limits for meats such as ham and bacon at lunch times, and support a restriction on the use of products which contain nitrites.Meanwhile, Glasgow city council - the largest local authority in Scotland - has confirmed its schools are planning to go nitrite free by the end of the year.A World Health Organisationreport from  placed processed meat in the same carcinogenic category as asbestos and tobacco.Experts found that a g portion eaten daily - the equivalent of two rashers of bacon, or a single sausage or hot dog - would increase the risk of bowel cancer by %.Herald on Sunday campaign: time to dump nitro meat from schools and hospitalsThe health risk occurs when nitrites - a preservative which helps turn meat pink - is heated and produces cancer-causing nitrosamines.

It won nearly % twenty years ago in , Labour collapsed to %.Then Richard Leonard took over as leader and his party crumbled to % at last monthrsquos European election. Within days, MSPs Neil Findlay and Daniel Johnson quit the shadow cabinet. Scottish Labour is on le-support.In an interview with the Herald on Sunday, Leonard, the partyrsquos first left-wing leader, reflected on Scottish Labourrsquos worst ever result, spoke candidly about the mistakes that were made during the campaign, and insisted he is staying on.ldquoI am absolutely clear that I have got no intention of stepping down. I am going to lead the Scottish Labour party into the elections of , he says, in a meeting room in the partyrsquos Glasgow headquarters.: Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsLeonard was quick to accept last week that his partyrsquos European election strategy had failed. Even though Scotland voted Remain in the Brexit referendum, Leonard had echoed Jeremy Corbynrsquos lsquosoft Brexitrsquo message that was designed to appeal to both sides in the EU debate. He succeeded only in haemorrhaging votes to the SNP and the Lib Dems.Post-drubbing, he has changed his mind and positioned his party as being unequivocally pro-Remain. He also says he will campaign around Scotland for the UK to stay in the EU.However, it is important to understand some of the root causes of why his European campaign bombed. The SNPrsquos election communication included a picture of Nicola Sturgeon. The Scottish Tories put Ruth Davidson front and centre of their literature. Scottish Labourrsquos main leaflet, by contrast, had a picture of Corbyn. Leonard was nowhere to be seen.ldquoIrsquove had conversations with Mark Drakeford, the First Minister of Wales, and we both agree that that was a mistake, because his picture wasnrsquot on the leaflet in Wales either, he says.Given that one of Leonardrsquos main problems is a low profile, such a decision by the UK party seems unforgivable. But it could have been even worse.ldquoThe leaflet that you describe originally had a text which didnrsquot recognise that wersquove got dferent challenges facing public services in Scotland. And so we had to re-write the text, Leonard says.Revealed: SNP ministers former staff received thousands in secret exit paymentsI put it to him that the picture decision was made by Corbynrsquos office, with the finger of suspicion being pointed at communications director Seamus Milne.ldquoI wasnrsquot involved in the negotiations about that, he says, weakly.This reply sums up the last twenty years of Scottish Labour. If Leonard is the leader of an autonomous party, he should not have to ldquonegotiate to have his face on his own partyrsquos leaflet. Little wonder critics hurl the branch office jibe at him.ldquoI accept that, as much as possible, the election should have been used as a  to promote me, he says.Leonard and Corbyn are political allies, but the Scottish Labour leaderrsquos colleagues believe the pair are too close. Colin Smyth, a member of Leonardrsquos shadow cabinet, said last week that he had to become his ldquoown man. Is Smyth correct ldquoI donrsquot accept this narrative that I am simply there as Jeremy Corbynrsquos man in Scotland, he says. ldquoI accept that I need to present myself, and make it absolutely clear, that there is a distinctive Scottish Labour party position on things.He also believes that Scottish Labour may need more autonomy: ldquoThere is still work that needs to be done, some battles that need to be re-fought, to establish the importance of having a distinctive Scottish Labour presentation to the people of Scotland.An area of potential reform is party discipline. One racism case relating to a Scottish member has dragged on for over eighteen months, but the investigation is handled at a UK level. Leonard is sympathetic to this changing:ldquoThere has been a debate about whether the current disciplinary process inside the Labour party...is fit for purpose. And I think that there is a case to be examined around that.:SNP councillor raises questions about partys poundk indyref fundraiserHowever, Leonardrsquos dficulties as leader did not start with the European election campaign. After he defeated moderate MSP Anas Sarwar to succeed Kezia Dugdale in , his allies believe he has been undermined by a relentless series of briefings, leaks and sniping.ldquoOf course I get frustrated when things are leaked, but in the end wersquove got to try and focus as a party, not on ourselves, but on all those people, in all those communities, that need a Labour Government, he says.ldquoThe Scottish Labour party will only succeed when we are outward looking and when we talk about the things that are important to the people we need to appeal to.Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, a leading Corbyn critic, recently wrote on WhatsApp that Scottish Labour is full of ldquothugs and incompetents. It was then leaked. What did Leonard think of these comments ldquoFirst of all, I dismiss the allegation. And, secondly, I just donrsquot think it is constructive or helpful.He also points out that Murray is a member of Labourrsquos governing Scottish Executive committee :ldquoHe is part of the leadership of the Scottish Labour party. If hersquos got views, he should express them, but he should express them in a more measured way.Sarwar, who Leonard sacked from his shadow cabinet last year, also piped up with an analysis of the partyrsquos woes last week. The Glasgow MSP said the leadership ldquomust decide whether they speak for a clique or faction, or ldquowhether they speak for all of our party.Leonard does not appear impressed with his colleaguersquos comments: ldquoI donrsquot recognise the description that the Scottish Labour party is some kind of clique. We are a party which embraces all the traditions of the Labour movement.I askhe believes Sarwar was loyal to him when he served in the shadow cabinet:ldquoHe was somebody who, I think, performed well in the Parliament, but when the year was up I decided to review the shadow cabinet and had a reshuffle. That is code for no.Picture: Leonard and SarwarCuriously, however, he seems to talk about the devolution of extra powers in the context of a post-Brexit UK, which since last week is an outcome he says he is opposing:ldquoIf Brexit were to happen, then areas of decision-making that currently rest with a Commission in Brussels, a European Parliament that convenes in plenary session in Strasbourg, thatrsquos subject to, in the end, decision-making by a Council of Ministers, and is overseen by a European Court of Justicehellip. we withdraw from the European Union we will no longer be part of these institutions.

A majority of his MSPs voted for Sarwar and group meetings are said to be brutal. Some of Leonardrsquos allies want the partyrsquos SEC, which has a left wing majority, to hand pick some of the candidates. Such a move could lead to a cull of serving MSPs and a civil war.Would he be in favour of the SEC being able to rank some of the candidates, rather than members  ldquoThat will be up to the SEC, comes the reply.I repeat the question and he again defers to the SEC. He is clearly thinking about it. ldquoIn each dferent Scottish Parliament election, from  onwards, there has been a dferent system employed for selecting people for the List. So we shall see, he says. I half expect him to wink at me at this point.Leonard, perhaps improbably for a man who has just led his party to fth place, is focused on coming first at the next Holyrood election. He has a dig at predecessors who have racked up a tally of defeats.ldquoOne of my criticisms of the Scottish Labour party in times past has been that our ambition was simply to be a strong opposition. If we donrsquot believe in ourselves, why should we expect anybody  to believe in us and vote for us He adds: ldquoThere is no reason why Scottish Labour canrsquot win those elections in , because we will be offering the most radical programme of economic, social and environmental change in the history of devolution.His problem will be convincing the voters. Some Labour policies are undoubtedly popular, but the same judgement cannot be made of his party.ldquoPeople may have lost their faith, or seen their faith diminished, in the Labour party, he concedes. ldquoBut I donrsquot think their faith has diminished in the values of the Labour party.

MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.\"A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: ldquoSettlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employeesrsquo right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.Some politicians have raised concerns about the use of non-disclosure agreements by elected officials.Labour peer Lord Foulkes said: ldquoThis is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs and the way they are used to gag people.ldquoI am surprised they would be used by any elected member.:Richard Leonard in row over plan which could cull Labour MSPsA Scottish Conservative spokesman said: ldquoWith the allegations against Joanna Cherry still unresolved, this is a really bad look for the SNP.ldquoI wonder how quickly Nicola Sturgeon will describe Ash Denham as an lsquoassetrsquo to the SNP government Traditionally NDAs have been used by corporations to prevent those employees leaving the business from disclosing confidential information or trade secrets, which could hinder their former companiesthey move to new job.The controversial element comes from when they are used to settle employment disputes. If a member of staff claims they have been wrongfully dismissed or discriminated against, employers have been found to settle the disputes to avoid any negative publicity, by paying staff and asking them to sign a non-disclosure or confidentiality agreement.By signing the agreement, employees are effectively legally bound not to repeat or discuss any of the allegations again in public, leading to the agreements being commonly described as gagging clauses.The use of non-disclosure agreements and clauses specically in discrimination cases, is currently under review in Westminster, with hundreds of submissions received in the past six months.It comes following revelations that employees of businessman Sir Phillip Greene signed NDAs when they accused him of sexual and racial discrimination.The Topshop tycoon was accused of making racist comments to black employees, groping female staff, and of being aggressive towards both male and female workers - all of which he denies.Westminsters Women and Equalities committee have heard evidence from business leaders, human rights campaigners and lawyers about their views on the use of NDAs in discrimination cases.Scottish employment law firm Thompsons solicitors were among those which submitted evidence.In its submission in November, the firm states thatthe clauses were banned altogether \"this would ensure that the true extent of sexual harassment and discrimination claims within the workplace was much more widely known.\"\"In addition, it would prevent serial offenders within a workplace having their conduct so easily ldquohushed up by their employer.\"Surely,there were several employees who all had their sexual harassment claims settled, in circumstances where the employees could discuss what happened to them, questions would need to be answered by senior managers in regards to what action,any, they were taking to address the perpetratorrsquos conduct.In addition, we believe thatwomen were able to speak about what happened to them in the workplace it is more likely that other women who have suffered similar acts of harassment or discrimination may come forward due to having a collective voice and therefore there being more likelihood that they would be believed.\"The flip side of banning NDAs is that it may prevent employers from settling employment claims. A confidentiality clause can have huge value for an employer whose reputation means a lot to them, their customers and their business. Therefore,NDAs were not permitted, an employer may be more likely to run sexual harassment cases to Tribunal in order to seek to prove that the harassment didnrsquot take place.\"The firm suggested that one way of controlling their use would be to force companies to publish how many they use in any given year, similar to the practice of publishing annual figures on the gender pay.SNP MP Hannah Bardell has also spoken previously about having to sign an NDA before becoming an elected politician, and welcomed the suggestion by the solicitors firm.She added: \"I think thats a very good idea. I dont knowit would work in the public sector or in politics, but certainly for the private sector I think it is a good idea.\"In my own experience having been through it myself in the private sector, I signed one because I felt pressured and I havent had another option.\"The reality is there are legitimate uses and illegitimate uses, and getting into the complexity of that is very dficult. Good employment practised for members and for staff, and support for staff and members is absolutely vital.\"They are all things that, whatever parliament we are in need to be constantly reviewed and addressed to make sure that everybody gets adequate support of there are any employment issues.\" Having looked into technical points of NDAs it is clear there are helpful uses but they are massively open to abuse as well, and I can only speak from a business perspective on that, from my own experience.\"Finding a way to stop the misuse is very challenging and I dont think anyone has been able to answer that question yet.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9933256.jpg?type=article-full","title":"outdoor-play-gets-funding-boost","story":"But for many it has been seen as an option only for the middle-classes and those able to afford the expensive costs of private daycare.Now children from disadvantaged backgrounds are to be given the same opportunity to spend their nursery years learning outside thanks to a Scottish familyrsquos donation of half a million pounds to create new outdoor nurseries in some of the most deprived communities.The pound, gt has been made anonymously to the charity Inspiring Scotland with a view to establishing a new social investment fund and social enterprises to run the nurseries.:Never mind the weather, let children go out and playThere are currently only  fully outdoor nurseries in Scotland, but the fund will support up to , children over a five-year period to access outdoor play and learning, concentrating on disadvantaged areas where there is limited or no outdoor nursery provision.The fundrsquos use of a social enterprise model to set up outdoor nurseries in deprived communities is designed to have a major impact on the le chances of children from some of Scotlandrsquos poorest communities.Research from around the world demonstrates the enormous benefits to childrenrsquos health, wellbeing and development of getting outside to play and learn.The right to play is enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, while the Scottish Government has issued guidance titled Out to Play designed to offer advice on building new outdoor nurseries, as well as encouraging indoor nurseries to get children outside more often, whatever the weather.:Playground politics as Presiding Officer fights for school greenspace#Celia Tennant, Inspiring Scotland Chief Executive, said: ldquoWe are delighted by the generosity of this donation to support the health, wellbeing and development Scotlandrsquos children.ldquoWe believe that playing and learning outdoors, being active and having fun is a crucial part of a childrsquos development, and we want all children in Scotland to be able to do that.\"This funding will allow us to create daily le-enhancing outdoor experiences for children from some of Scotlandrsquos most deprived neighbourhoods.\"She added: \"This new private funding is testament to a growing movement in Scotland to embrace outdoor learning and of a deepening understanding of the huge physical, mental, social and emotional benefits of playing outside from an early age.Initially, the fund will select and invest in five organisations to set up as social enterprises to run outdoor nurseries in dferent deprived communities.

He had to escape from a box that was completely filled with gravel.As time ticked by and he failed to appear, health and safety workers approached the box, before hanging back as he suddenly dropped out.The stunt terried the audience, which included pop star Cheryl, while Magician X drew gasps from the judges and audience when he took off his mask to reveal he was actually previous contestant Marc Spelmann.He had performed in a hood and white mask throughout the series.But he revealed his true identity at the end of his performance.Out of all those performing, though, Mr Thackery earned a standing ovation for his moving rendition of Love Changes Everything.As his song came to an end, the crowd chanted his name.\"What a magic moment you have created on this show,\" Walliams said. \"I think tonight you are unbeatable.\"Holden said she knew the pensioner was not taking part because of the fame and glamour.\"I know that this is because you served your country and I hope tonight that they serve you,\" she said.Magician X said it felt \"amazing\" to be runner-up.He said: \"To come second to someone like Colin, who has given his le for us ...

Nobody can say they are happy with our main civic space as it is.ldquoResidents and visitors understand that we canrsquot just leave it as it is. It is important that we donrsquot impose something on the city.ldquoWe wonrsquot repeat the mistakes of the past but equally we do have a set of principles for what the square needs, it needs to be accessible, it needs to be clean and it needs to be focused on people.:: Basque dancers get folk festival under wayldquoA place where residents and visitors want to spend time and that the city genuinely feel belongs to them.ldquoSo letrsquos start this discussion and hear what the residents want for a space that has had an important role in its history and will play an equally important role in its future.There will also be local consultation events planned across the city.Previous attempts at making big changes to George Square have not gonedown well and there is a recognition at the council that it did not get it right before.Previous plans for George Square sparked controversy.In  an international design competition was launched for a revamp of the square, which included removing the statues and the raised grassed beds to create a bigger flexible space for events.Plans for new lighting and a water feature were central to the redesign which was expected to cost around poundm.More than  design and architect firms from around the world expressed an interest in bidding for the work.It is understood that any new proposals put forward will be considered before the council then instructs a design company to draw up plans that will then go out for full public consultation.There will be no international design contest this time.At this stage there is no proposal or preferred option from the council.George Square was a central part of the Connectivity Commission recommendations which wanted to ensure the city centre was a space where people were prioritised over vehicles.It could also be the location of an underground train station for a tunnel linking the rail networks north and south of the city centre in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"how-a-book-of-verse-is-helping-junior-doctors-cope-with-stress","story":"But now junior doctors are being prescribed poetry to help them cope with the stress of their frontline duties.The medical profession is gting a book of poems, titled Tools of the Trade, to all doctors graduating in Scotland.It is a collection of poems ndash some written by doctors ndash that speak to the experience of being a junior medic with themes such as tiredness, compassion and worry, and breaking bad or good news.At a time when both junior doctors and general practitioners face increasing challenges, the book is being published by The Scottish Poetry Library and Polygon, and has the support of the Medical and Dental Defence Union of Scotlandand the Royal College of General PractitionersScotland.Dr Lesley Morrison, who edited the book along with Dr John Gillies, Samuel Tongue and Rev Ali Newell, said: ldquoIn order to look after patients, we need to look after and be kind to ourselves.The editors offer the poems, some of them written by doctors including Dannie Abse, Rafael Campo, Glenn Colquhoun, and Martin MacIntyre, as ldquotools to help connect with your patients, your colleagues, yourself.Poetry was a comfort and inspiration for Dr Morrison, now a university tutor, when she practised as a GP, and gave her the idea for poetry aimed at doctors.She took it to the Scottish Poetry Library and the first edition was published in , and it is now updated with new poems for the next generation of doctors going into hospitals and general practice.ldquoRobert Burnsrsquo poetry helped me hugely ndash the way he talks about humanity and being able to see the good in everyone, that is what being a GP is all about, she said.ldquoIrsquove always been interested in how the arts and humanities can improve the experience of being a doctor, and transform the work we do for patients, she said.ldquoPoetry gives you a wider perception of peoplersquos lives and helps you be a better doctor.ldquoItrsquos a great privilege to be a doctor and be allowed intimate access to peoplersquos lives, but it can be overwhelming at times.ldquoI hope this book will offer support to new doctors after a night of mayhem when they donrsquot know what to do.ldquoWhen they feel terrible, they can reach for this book and find a poem that makes them feel better.The poems are ided into five sections to help new doctors in dferent situations: Looking after Yourself Looking after Others Beginnings Being with Illness Endings.Doctor and writer Gavin Francis, who wrote the introduction to the collection, said: ldquoJohn Keats, who trained as a doctor, counselled that the best poetry should strike you as lsquoa wording of your own highest thoughtsrsquo.ldquoWhether you hated poetry at school or keep volumes by your bedside, yoursquoll find something here to appreciate now and in the years to come.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Families have told of their experiences on Universal Credit\"  Universal Credit in Crisis: These people want you to hear their stories of le on the problem benefit before it is rolled-out even furtherviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Tesco colleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme this weekend\"  Inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"charity dog walk to be held at haddo","story":"Employees of Nicol of Skene will be hosting a charity dog walk at Haddo Country Park in July.The event will be held on Sunday, July  at .am.The idea for the event was created through the love for dogs Nicol of Skene employees have and, their partnership with the cancer care charity, Friends of ANCHOR.The charity is one very close to many at Nicol of Skene.Richard Stott, Managing Director at Nicol of Skene, said: “Friends of ANCHOR are a very important charity in the North East of Scotland and unfortunately, many lives have been affected by cancer, our staff included. “The dog walk is a fantastic opportunity to have a great day out to raise money for a worthwhile cause.”Tickets for the charity dog walk cost £ per adult, £. per child and all dogs go free.The cost includes a sandwich, a bottle of water and all dogs participating will receive a free doggy goody bag.

The Charter lays out the unique approach, achievements and impacts of Fair Trade and illustrates how inclusive economic growth, fair wages and better working conditions can be achieved while empowering women and ensuring opportunities for the next generation.Aberdeenshire became the seventeenth Fairtrade Zone in , contributing to Scotland becoming a Fairtrade Nation.The area’s current Fairtrade Zone status continues until May , and one of the points in the Council’s Environment and Climate Change Policy states a commitment to develop an approach to ensure that local environmental, social and economic issues relating to the health and fair treatment of people are considered while also strengthening Aberdeenshire as a Fairtrade Zone.Following its decision last week, chair of Aberdeenshire Council’s Sustainability Committee, Colin Pike, said: “Pledging support for the new International Fair Trade Charter further demonstrates Aberdeenshire Council’s commitment to the global Fair Trade movement.“We as a Sustainability Committee and as a Council fully endorse the aims and refreshed vision for Fair Trade in the ever-changing world we live in, and in line with our Environment and Climate Change Policy.” Vice chair, Isobel Davidson, added: “Aberdeenshire Council has been committed to the Fair Trade movement for a number of years now in ious capacities, and pledging our support for this new International Charter is a further demonstration of our continued advocacy going forward.”Aberdeenshire Council is also a member of the Scottish Fair Trade Forum .

When Samaritans first started, for example, homosexuality was illegal.“But people still face the same challenges they did when that first call came in.“When there is no-one  to talk to, we’re there. That’s what is at the heart of the Samaritans – the power of human connection.”Founded on the principle that trained volunteers should answer calls, that has not changed either.And it’s something that strikes very many callers who use the service.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Members of Aberdeenshire Councils Sustainability Committee: Cllr Martin Ford, Cllr Iain Taylor, Cllr Victoria Harper, Cllr Isobel Davidson , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  , Cllr Sarah Dickinson, Cllr Colin Pike , Cllr Sandy Wallace, Cllr Anouk Kloppert, Cllr Neil Baillie\"  Council pledges supportto International Fair Trade Charter viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"That’s the equivalent of  days of listening in one year alone. James said: “I’ve spoken to numerous people who have used the service. “Many of them have said that knowing a volunteer is giving up their time to help them at their lowest ebb is incredibly powerful.“When people are struggling, eventhey have family and friends close by, it can be hard for them to open up and talk about what is troubling them.“That’s particularly true of Scottish men who have a reputation for being stoic and unlikely to talk about their emotions.“However, that is also now changing and the ratio of men to women calling the Samaritans is almost  .“Men are more inclined to pick up the phone nowthey are worried or sad about something as they know that they can talk to someone at the Samaritans in the strictest confidence.“When callers phone in, it’s completely anonymous. “We can’t see your phone number or where you are calling from and you don’t even have to give your nameyou don’t want to.“All of that means people can have conversations in a way they wouldn’t normally.”Men and women contact Samaritans for a wide range of reasons including isolation and loneliness, problems with mental or physical health and worries about family and relationships. Just under a third of callers also express thoughts of suicide.Volunteers also run hundreds of community events and awareness sessions, working with a wide range of organisations including schools, colleges, foodbanks, community centres, support groups, youth groups and health and emergency services.These events help spread the message that Samaritans is there for everyone.The charity also works with a range of national and local partners to ensure suicide prevention is a priority. Samaritans runs a Prison Listening Scheme, training inmates to become listening volunteers and provide peer-support.And through its work with National Rail, it has trained thousands of rail staff in suicide prevention.Of course, operating  hours a day,  days a year means the charity needs ever more volunteers to help provide its services, which now include email and text messages too.So in this diamond anniversary year, James is hopeful of recruiting an additional  volunteers.“We have up to  volunteers, more than  of whom answer calls, emails text messages and letters,” said James. “What our volunteers do is pretty demanding – when you pick up a phone, you’ve no idea what someone is going to say to you next.“Being non-judgemental is the most important quality we look for in volunteers.“Many of our callers thank us for our advice but our volunteers don’t actually give advice – they are trained in active listening, encouraging people to share their story and work through their own problems.“We are often referred to as the fourth emergency service and demand across the UK is substantial.“That demand is not going to go away and we want to make sure we’re here for people now and in  years.“But there’s a natural turn-over of volunteers so we always need to recruit more.“We could be there for even more peoplewe had more volunteers.“So we’re looking for people of all ages and from all backgrounds to get on board.“We’d love to hear from younger volunteers as we’re looking at new technology, such as webchat, to respond to people too.“In the s and s, most people came to our branches for face to face chats now almost  per cent of our contacts are via the phone and you don’t need credit on your mobile to call us.“We can’t do online chats now but we want to make sure we’re accessible to future generations so we hope to set them up soon.”John Lawrie has been a volunteer at the Edinburgh branch for  years and has witnessed many changes.As long as his hearing remains intact, the -year-old plans to continue.Initially, though, the retired investment manager had his doubts.He said: “I never thought I’d be able to do it. But in the early s, a mini series was on TV about the Samaritans and I started wonderingit was something I could do.“So, almost on the spur of the moment, I applied. “After an initial chat, I was invited to do the training.“The intervening  years have been immensely rewarding. That might sound strange but speaking to someone in a terrible state and them ringing off  minutes later, feeling better, can be really rewarding.“I’ve not changed their le they are still in the same boat as when they first called. But talking to someone  can often help them see a way forward.“It’s a privilege to be the person that they’ve opened up to.”Some calls are, of course, harrowing but volunteers are there for each other and also debrief their manager at the end of each sht.John said: “I have spoken to people who are suicidal – we’re not there to talk them out of it. “However, we do ask them to talk about why they’re feeling so bad. “The fact they’ve called the Samaritans might mean they’re not quite as certain as they say they are.”John also enjoys visiting schools. “I often worry they’ll think I’m terribly old, which I am!” he said. “But I like to think they get on better with their grandparents.“I always end my talk by saying: “I hope you never need our service but,you do, I hope you never hesitate to use it.”Someone contacts the Samaritans every six secondsToday Samaritans has grown to become the leading charity for suicide prevention with  branches across the UK and Ireland. Someone contacts the charity every six seconds.In Scotland, volunteers were contacted more than , times last year and spent more than , hours providing emotional support to people in distress and crisis.People can contact Samaritans by phone, email, text, letter or by visiting their local branch. And in the coming years, the charity will be introducing new methods to provide emotional support including webchat.Today – just as  years ago – every call for help is answered by a volunteer. And to meet demand, the charity needs to recruit at least  volunteers in Scotland in . Anyone can contact Samaritans for free,  hours a day,  days a year.

We now have policies like minimum unit pricing and a new alcohol strategy that acknowledges the scale of the challenge we face in Scotland.Yet despite some positive advancements in Scottish Government policy over the last decade, alcohol harm is costing Scotland £. billion annually and is still contributing to the death of people we know or love, every single day. People like -year-old Gerry from Lanarkshire – my dad – who died fouryears ago.Growing up around alcohol has a big influence over us, especially for the ,+ children in Scotland living with a problem drinker.The statistics bring home the scale of the challenge. I know, because my family has been one of them and I’ve seen first-hand how “social drinking” can spiral into full-blown dependency and destroy relationships, careers, health and happiness. During my time in Parliament, speaking up about Scotland’s relationship with alcohol has been a personal priority.I’ve raised the issue of tackling stigma directly with the First Minister and as Co-Convenor of the Cross-Party Group on Drugs and Alcohol Misuse. Addiction is an illness and problem drinking in Scotland is a public health emergency. Social stigma and corporate influences are strong, so our decision-makers need to have courage.That’s why the collaboration between the Children’s Parliament and Alcohol Focus Scotland is exciting. Young people talking openly about alcohol and how it affects them in their everyday lives is a powerful message to politicians.So, with young people pushing for change, like those in the Children’s Parliament that I’m looking forward to welcoming to the Scottish Parliament soon, I am optimistic about our future and the progress that is possible. Communities need more services and investment and that’s why Scottish Labour is committed to a social responsibility levy. The legal provision already exists for this additional tax on alcohol sales. We simply want the Scottish Government to enact this and reinvest the funds in communities and recovery programmes.A public health approach that protects young people and changes our attitudes to alcohol can make Scotland a healthier and happier nation.Monica Lennon is Scottish Labour Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"life re injected into edinburgh international film festival alistair harkness","story":"The programme launch of the Edinburgh International Film Festival has been a dispiriting affair in recent years, with too few films of note to get excited about and far too many unknown quantities proving they were unknown quantities for a reason.Opening with Edinburgh director Ninian Doff’s properly funny coming-of-age comedy Boyz in the Wood, however, the rd edition of the festival proves there’s le in the old dog yet.There is the UK premieres of Jim Jarmusch’s recent Cannes-opener The Dead Don’t Die, Joanna Hogg’s Sundance-winning The Souvenir and — headlining a commemorative retrospect — Varga by Agnès, the final film by the late, great Agnès Varda.

Having been extracted in the lab, the DNA has been sequenced and compared against known species, creating a near-definitive list of everything that lives in the loch for the first time.The results of the study were supposed to be published in January, but cataloguing the extensive range of micro-organisms and bacteria has taken longer than expected.The team has found around  dferent species of fish and up to , species of bacteria, some of which will have been deposited in Loch Ness by animals using connecting rivers.Prof Gemmell said he hoped to announce the full findings of the study at a press conference in Scotland next month.“Is there anything deeply mysterious  Hmm. It depends what you believe,” he said. “Is there anything startling  There are a few things that are a bit surprising.“What we’ll have achieved is what we set out to do, which is document the bioersity of Loch Ness in June  in some level of detail.“We’ve tested each one of the main monster hypotheses and three of them we can probably say aren’t right and one of them might be.”Although Prof Gemmell would not confirm which hypothesis might be right, the two main theories about the monster is it is a long-necked plesiosaur that somehow survived the period when dinosaurs became extinct, or it is a sturgeon or giant catfish.Prof Gemmell admitted that part of the reason for the delay in publishing the results was due to a series of failed attempts to film a television documentary.Negotiations with a series of production companies ended without a deal.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu election results find out who won all of the seats for scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...With almost all the results in from Scotland, the SNP seems likely to win three of the six Scottish MEP seats, with Scottish Labour losing its two MEPs.window.twttr Results from the  councils across Scotland showed the SNP, who fought the election campaign on a strong pro-European , had polled . per cent.The partys previous best Euro election result was . per cent in .: EU Election results: Scots reject Brexit as Labour and Conservatives humiliatedMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Formal declaration to come, but clear now that @theSNP has won the Euro election emphatically - we are on course to take  out of  seats.

The first seats declared on the night saw former Scottish Tory MSP Brian Monteith win a seat in the north-east of England for the Brexit Party, which took two seats in the region, while Labour took one seat. The Brexit Party’s  per cent share of the vote wasdouble the  per cent racked up by Labour.: Scottish Parliament’s Presiding officer on tour for anniversaryLabour’s shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry blamed the lack of clarity about the party’s position on Brexit for its poor showing.“We went into the election where the most important issue was what was our view on leaving the European Union and we were not clear about it.“We were not clear on the one single thing that people wanted to hear and sent people out to campaign on that and unfortunately we just weren’t clear enough.”She said the party must now come out clearly in favour of a second vote on leaving the EU.The misery for the Tories continued just days after the announcement of Theresa May’sdeparture as leader, as the party was left heading for about  per cent of the vote. The omens were bad for the big two when the first results of the night came through in Leeds and saw Brexit claim victory with  per cent of the vote. Labour slumped to  per centwhile the Tory vote was down by  per cent. Tory leadership contender Boris Johnson tweeted a link to hisarticle, adding: “The message from last night’s results is clear. It is time for us to deliver Brexit and set out our positive plans for the country.”Other results in ares like Sedgmoor in Somerset and Newcastle in the north-east saw big wins for the Brexit Party. Turnout was up considerably north of the border by  per cent in some places, despite a lacklustre campaign, suggesting that Scots have been prompted to turnout by the recent Brexit turmoil. Edinburgh recorded a . per cent turnout, an increase from . per cent in the  vote.It was a similar picture across the EU, where the traditional parties had a bad night, while the far right enjoyed a surge in support. The Greens also fared well. In France, president Emmanuel Macron looked poised to suffer defeat to Marine Le Pen of the National Front.Seventy-three MEPs will be elected to represent the UK, but they may only be in office for six months with the UK still poised to leave the EU in November.

The former member of staff resigned and started official proceedings after finding an email detailing their personal health problems had allegedly been sent to another SNP MSP.In  and , the National Union of Journalists represented other employees of Ms Denham who had complained about their treatment.One staff member is said to have been given a £, compensation payment as part of a settlement agreement, which included a non-disclosure clause, after complaining they had been discriminated against on the grounds of disability.In another case, an employee was given more than £, as a “goodwill payment” when they quit their post.The person cited bullying and victimisation from within the MSP’s office – not by the MSP.An SNP spokesman said: “We do not comment on employment matters. “MSPs, in common with all employers, are able to let \u2028staff go in line with HR advice, guidance and legal requirements where their employment is no longer required.” The Scottish Parliament last year removed the non-disclosure clause from its standard settlement agreement.However, that does not rule out the use of gagging ordersboth parties agree to it.The settlement agreements used by Ms Denham for two of the cases contained non-disclosure clauses.A Scottish Parliament spokesman said: “Settlement agreements are a legitimate means of facilitating the ending of an employment relationship on mutually agreed terms and do not affect former employees’ right to make a protected disclosure such as whistleblowing.”But Labour peer Lord Foulkes told The Herald on Sunday: “This is certainly not transparent. I have a number of concerns about NDAs [non-disclosure agreements] and the way they are used to gag people.

Even though that lead evaporated in the latest Opinium poll , they’re still celebrating a first UK top spot in nine years.: Dani Garavelli: ‘I disagree with Jo’ moment a bad start for SwinsonThe good news for the Lib Dems is that English Remain voters have either forgotten their part in imposing university tuition fees and austerity or decided there are bigger Brexit fish to fry. Whatever the reason, the party most used to losing deposits is riding high. But will they be able to capitalise on this opportunity without the weel kent face of Sir Vince Cable at the helm  : Jo Swinson: I will take on ‘independence obsessed’ SNPThe battle to replace him as leader at the end of July is a modest affair compared with the Tories’ -strong line-up. It features just two candidates: Sir Ed Davey and Jo Swinson. Nominations close on  June, the day Theresa May bids a tearful farewell. But at that point the Lib Dems must decide what kind of party they really are – nasty or nice Tory-lite or genuinely radical a one-trick, anti-Brexit pony or a vigorous and serious potential government. It won’t be as easy as it looks. The party’s moment in the sun may finally have arrived but beyond “Bollocks to Brexit” it’s not clear the party has a winning slogan, distinctive policies or a new leader capable of commanding the UK stage.Take Sir Ed Davey, whose radical credentials are surely damaged by taking a gong from the Tories in consolation for losing his seat after the coalition debacle. Sir Ed’s record as energy minister is underwhelming from a Scottish perspective. Subsidies for community hydro and solar  were cut and vital subsea connectors to the Northern and Western Isles vetoed because islanders wouldn’t knuckle down and build vast wind farms tode-risk the project and simply the budgeting process. Even though Alistair Carmichael was Scottish Secretary at the time, the long-awaited Northern Isles cables weren’t built on the Lib Dems’ watch. Mind you, Sir Ed did approve connectors to Norway and Ireland instead. Nice. He also introduced contracts for dferencein place of subsidies for onshore and offshore wind plus marine renewables. Somehow Scots firms have won only a handful of these contracts and a new island-shaped CfD was only introduced last week. Soon after losing his seat in , Ed was knighted and joined the PR firm that represents EDF Energy. EDF had just been awarded the contract to build Hinkley Point C nuclear power station by… Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Ed Davey. Oh, yes, and Sir Ed supports fracking too. This is what passes for a radical record on tackling climate change in England.Anyway, back to Brexit – doubtless the Lib Dems’ strongest card. Sir Ed wants to use “the Cooper-Letwin process” so the Brexit default is Revoke rather than No Deal on \u2028 October. Whoop, whoop. When the crowd-funded Revoke Article  legal action failed its first hurdle in February , Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine promptly quit. Happily for MPs, all are now legally entitled to press the Revoke button, thanks to the tenacity, vision and co-operative capacity of the original petitioners in the Green, SNP and Labour parties. Without their constancy when the going got rough, Ms Jardine’s colleague Lib Dem MP Tom Brake would not have been able to join the posse in the latter stages and give the Lib Dems a democratic name-check. Poor.Meanwhile Sir Ed’s sole opponent, Jo Swinson, announced her candidacy on last week’s Question Time, taking a pop at the SNP’s failure to close the educational attainment gap. The MP for East Dunbartonshire cited figures from the Scottish Index on Multiple Deprivationwhich suggests only  per cent of children in Govan go on to higher education. This immediately provoked a social media storm, not least from Govan High’s headteacher who cited more recent figures which show the school’s actually doing pretty well. Was this an own goal or just plain baffling  Well, it would be usefula Holyrood statistician could explain how such wildly dfering stats can attach to roughly the same educational cohort. It would also be pointless to maintain that income doesn’t play a shamefully large part in determining access to opportunity in Scotland. But that’s why roughly half the population supports Scottish independence so all policy decisions, tax levers, benefit levels and income streams are under Scottish control, all ability to offload responsibility are at an end and a truly concerted sht of resources can tackle Dickensian levels of poverty, generated by David Cameron’s Con-Dem coalition government. Just for the record, both Sir Ed and Ms Swinson were members – she voted  times for the bedroom tax, five times against raising benefits in line with inflation, seven times for disability cuts and  times for general welfare cuts. But bygones…Even though the SIMD figures do exist, the statistical basis of her Question Time rebuke was dodgy, the “Milngavie air of superiority”was snfy, the “forced breeziness” a little wearing and the choice of First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s seat as a target was negative and predictable. If Ms Swinson aims to outdo Ruth Davidson with high octane attacks on the SNP’s record in office, good luck. The SNP isn’t perfect. But politicians in glass houses shouldn’t throw stones. And thanks to the Lib Dems’ disastrous involvement with the Tories, shatterproof glass only covers them south of the Border for the single issue of Brexit. Even there, they must share the honours as second vote champions with the UK Greens. In Scotland, the latest poll puts them in fourth on just  per cent. And this despite winning a seat in recent European elections.If it’s too late to bring on a fresh face, the Lib Dems must find a fresh approach. Otherwise, it’s not just the big two parties that face political oblivion – ultimately, the big two-dependent Lib Dems will become political casualties as well. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"new benefit for low income families for cost of sending children to school","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Low-income families are now able to apply for a new benefit to help cover the costs of sending a child to school.Applications for the School Age Payment can be made from today for eligible families who have a child old enough to be starting school this August.The payment will provide £ per child, paid in the year the child starts school.The application process will be open until  February next year, while parents who have deferred school entry so that their child starts school in August  are also encouraged to apply in the current window.Following the introduction of the payment, the Scottish Government is now delivering four new benefits - the Best Start Grant Pregnancy and Baby Payment, the Early Learning Payment, the School Age Payment and the Carer’s Allowance Supplement.The payment is part of the Best Start Grant, a package of three payments for families in receipt of eligible benefits - including Universal Credit, income support, housing benefit and tax credits - to help at key stages in a child’s le.The Best Start Grant package also includes the Pregnancy and Baby Payment, which has been open for applications since December , and the Early Learning Payment, which launched in April.Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: “Covering the costs of a child starting school puts pressure on family finances, and we have created this new payment to help ease that burden, putting more money into the pockets of families at a time when they need it most.“We are committed to doing all we can to make sure Scotland is the best place for a child to grow up. We want to increase financial support to families, bringing equality to children by giving them help towards a fairer start.“We also want to encourage everyone who is entitled to a payment to apply, so will be working with services to promote the benefit to ensure as many people as possible are aware they can access this new additional support.”Scottish Greens parliamentary co-leader and social security spokeswoman Alison Johnstone MSP encouraged all eligible families to apply for the grant.She said: “Greens have been calling for expansion of income maximisation schemes that raise awareness of social security entitlements and offer support to apply for them.“One such scheme, Healthier, Wealthier Children, which is putting millions into the pockets of families when it would otherwise go unclaimed, is being rolled out across Scotland because of Green action.“We should be building a new Scottish social security system that doesn’t simply wait and hope people will apply, but actively reach out to make people aware of what support they are due and ensure that gets to them.“Making families aware that children starting school can get this new help is an important part of that.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"tory leadership candidates split over brexit direction","story":"Confusion over the future direction of Brexit deepened after candidates in the crowded Tory leadership contest split over whether to delay the UK#s exit from the EU, or accept a no-deal departure.Health Secretary Matt Hancock released a Brexit strategy that allows for a further delay to the UK’s exit date, joining Michael Gove and Rory Stewart in effectively ruling out no-deal.Home Secretary Sajid Javid also refused to rule out extending Britain’s departure from the EU beyond the end of October, although he claimed he “cannot envisage the circumstances” where he would do so.But Andrea Leadsom, the former leader of the House of Commons whose resignation brought down Theresa May, insisted that what she called a “managed exit” without a deal can be delivered.It came as a th candidate entered the race to lead the Conservatives and become Prime Minister, with the former minister Sam Gyimah joined the field as the only candidate to support a second EU referendum.: SNP warned against dictating wording of indyref questionFormer Tory grandee Ann Widdecombe, who quit the party and was elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party, said the number of candidates showed the Conservatives had “gone mad”.Unveiling his Brexit plan, Mr Hancock said that the “real choice is between leaving with a deal and no Brexit,” adding that “no-deal Brexit is not a policy choice available to the next Prime Minister”.Pledging to be “honest about the trade offs as we leave the EU”, he said it was impossible to have complete control over the UK’s laws while maintaining frictionless access to trade.Mr Hancock said that as Prime Minister, he would “immediately” enshrine the rights of EU citizens living in the UK in law, and set up an “Irish Border Council” to resolve the most dficult issue in Brexit talks.Modelled on multiparty negotiations to secure the peace process, the council would also include representatives from the Republic of Ireland and the EU to develop a solution to the border issue that is acceptable to all sides.However, he also said he would seek a time-limit to the border backstop element of the UK’s Brexit deal, something that the EU has repeatedly rejected.Meanwhile, appearing on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Javid said the Irish border was “the tail that wags the dog” on Brexit and said new technology could avoid the need for the backstop, which would keep the UK under EU trading rulesno solution for the border is found.“We need to make sure we can do more to build that goodwill in Ireland and build their confidence,” the Home Secretary said.”What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border.“I think it could be done in a couple of years, but I think we could cover their costs.”Mr Javid was asked whether he would ask to delay Brexit beyond the end of October, and said: “I’m clear that my plan would be to leave on October . I want to leave with a deal butI have to choose between no-deal and no Brexit I would pick no deal.”But pressed again, he added: “That’s not something I would do, but we are a parliamentary democracy and what we’ve seen in the last few months is Parliament has taken on some extraordinary powers to initiate its own legislation soit’s statute,it’s the law, I would not break the lawI was prime minister, of course I would observe the law.”In her own interview on the Andrew Marr Show, Ms Leadsom unveiled a “three-step plan for a managed exit” which she insisted was not the same as leaving without a deal.“I think it’s based on the premise that, number one, we have to leave the EU at the end of October, and, number two, the Withdrawal Agreement Bill is dead - the EU won’t reopen the Withdrawal Agreement and the UK Parliament won’t vote for it,” she said.Meanwhile, in a series of posts on social media, Mr Stewart said no-deal Brexit was a “recipe for further delay and uncertainty” that would undermine the UK’s “ years of reputation for economic competence”.The International Development Secretary received a signicant endorsement from within the Cabinet as David Gauke, the Justice Secretary, said Mr Stewart’s unconventional style had “real strengths” and could win an election.Mr Gauke also said he would not be able to serve in a cabinet which pursued leaving without a deal as its “objective”.“I don’t think you can completely take it off the table because the European Union might refuse any kind of extension and we might find ourselves in that situation,” Mr Gauke said.“So I accept that we should prepare for it butit is an objective in saying ‘no-deal is the right answer’ I wouldn’t support that policy, I wouldn’t be able to serve in a cabinet that pursued that policy.”Mr Stewart also won support the former Chancellor and Father of the House, veteran pro-EU Tory Kenneth Clarke, while former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said she would back Mr Gove.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"west lothian cat owner catches incredible moment tiny mouse fends off cat named tom","story":"A photographer captured a real-le Tom and Jerry battle as a tiny rodent survives an epic encounter against its feline tormentor - called Tom.The extraordinary pictures, taken by Gordon McBrearty, , show his pet tabby Tom toying with the tiny mouse in his garden.The pair faced a y  minute standoff as the intrepid mouse squared up to the tabby in an unbelievable face-off.The curious cat seemed to forget the pair are supposed to be sworn enemies as she sat back and watched the mouse stand on its hind legs to clean its whiskers.At one point the mouse even appears to jump up and down in a bid to scare the cat away.During the set-to Tom, a two-year-old female, picked up the feisty rodent in its jaws before dropping it - as the relieved creature escaped and ran off.Gordon, from Uphall, West Lothian, watched the brave standoff from his kitchen window and couldnt believe it when the mouse survived the encounter.He said: \"It was in the morning I was in the kitchen and looked out and could see the mouse was still alive.\"I photographed it over a period of ten to  minutes.\"The mouse escaped into a woodpile then my we saw the mouse again, hiding under a plant pot.\"We heard a magpie making a hell of a racket, it mustve been wanting a piece of the action.\"\"Tom would walk over to me almost showing off and as the mouse tried to run away, she would run over and jump on it.\"Every now and again the wee mouse would sit up on its hind legs and clean its whiskers.\"Its the type of thing a lot of people see but rarely photograph.\"With the light it worked incredibly well.\"For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Schiller was surely making a typically Enlightenment-era appeal for people everywhere to enjoy brotherhood or solidarity, irrespective of the irrational isions imposed on us, saying that joy in this reunites us. He knew it was chance that saw us on one side or another of any nationalist driven war, and wanted to emphasise the need for healing and togetherness.It’s a concept of course that also is captured by Robert Burns ten years after Schiller in: For a’ that and a’ that, or Trotz alledem und alledem, as it also became in .

Napoleonic Wars were certainly consequential in the rationale behind the companies formation. Particularly the Peninsular war.It wasn’t of course ever a one way street. Garve, a contemporary of Schiller and Goethe, did a great to broadcast the gains of the Scottish Enlightenment by translating and accrediting the works of Smith, Hume, Ferguson, Hutcheson, Reid and others, to the extent that Goethe himself, though perhaps before his heyday, said there was nowhere in Europe that could hold a candle to what was happening in Scotland. It would be unreasonable to suggest Burns did not become familiar with the thoughts of Kant, Rousseau, Locke, and other European philosophers, directly or indirectly, in the salons of Edinburgh. It would similarly be a nonsense to suggest that Haldane had no exposure to all this. His inspiration cannot be orced from the earlier flourishing of inspirational ideas of brotherhood and equal worth that happily live on yet. Shetland, after the Napoleonic era, seems to have been quite a radical place to a degree, as the later broken-promise legal challenges possibly demonstrate.

Students have learnt about the aquacultures along the tidal zones of Skye and food practices that can support them.During the summer, three graduates of the course have been awarded a Climavore apprenticeship in restaurants across Skye and Raasay # Edinbane Lodge, Raasay House, and Scorrybreac Restaurant.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Since then the McVeigh family has raised funds for Leukaemia and Lymphoma NI and the Anthony Nolan trust,with a range of events. Walter McVeigh during his playing days. “My hope, on behalf of my family, “ said Margaret, “is for everyone to have a great day and to raise money for the two charities that are very close to our hearts, who save many lives.“Our family and friends have been working tirelessly during the fundraisers on the lead-up to the main event. “The communities of Dromara, Gilford, Limavady, Belfast and beyond have really got behind us during our big breakfast, ballots, craft mornings, sponsored walks and discos we can’t thank them enough.”Son, Ryan, added: “Just like our dad, Blake and I have been involved with Dromara Football Club most of our lives. It’s great the club are helping us to create a special day that will be remembered forever, with funds going to two worthy charities.”Walter visited Old Trafford many times and dreamt of taking his children to see United play, but it wasn’t to be.When the family began thinking about what they could do to honour him, on his th anniversary year, it felt right, they said, to invite Manchester United Legends to play at Dromara a select team of Walter’s old frends, teammates and his children. Walter’s son Blake added: “I know how much my dad would have loved to have been involved in a game like this, playing alongside his idols, as well as Ryan and I.”The family’s thanks go to DVFC for the use of its ground on match day and for continued support over the years also to local councils for help on launch day and for support provided. In the run-up to the big day, many United Legend Players have been released, including Brian McClair, Keith Gillespie and Bryan Robson.

They get to meet the young ones and they’ve prepared lunch for the kids so they’ll get to sit down and have a meal together where the young ones can learn about the service provided here.”She added: “The garden is looking impressive with all the dferent colours. The young ones are putting their mark on the garden, which is great.”Michael McAllister from Leonard Cheshire Disability commented: “It’s good to get the guys involved in this project.“This is the third day we’ve been here and we’re getting ready for the barbecue next week. It’s been good fun, but it’s a good opportunity for the young people to get involved with Rosemount House.“It’s a good education for them. It’s also about creating more awareness in Belfast about homelessness. This is a real positive project for the young people to be involved in.”Michael Bradley, who lectures at Belfast Met, said: “Partnering up with Leonard Cheshire gives young people the chance to give back to the community. They’re also developing teamwork skills and communication skills. They’re able to help the community, but it’s also part of their qualication too.”He added: “One of the residents came in one day and spoke to the young ones about the choices that he made that led him here. It had quite a big impact on the students, because they could relate to it in some ways. It’s really striking a note with them.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"largest tv in ireland on sale in west belfast electronic store","story":"CUSTOMERS in Noel Grimley Electrics did a double take on Wednesday afternoon as the latest in TV technology was unveiled.The ” Samsung QLED, the first in the north, was unveiled – just in time for Saturday’s Champions League final between Liverpool and Spurs.“It’s great to see the TV displayed in the store,” said owner Eamon Grimley, “we are a big Samsung dealer and were the first in the north to sell the K TV. That’s what we are here for, to showcase the latest in technology. People in West Belfast want the latest, most up-to-date technology available,” he said. “The QLED is the screen quality, it’s giving you the best in picture quality.

It’s basically two and a half times brighter than a standard LED TV and there are over a billion colours that come through on the screen.“The two main things with the TV is that it has Apple TV.

PIPS came to the house for the wake and I got talking to them,” she said.“They offered me the chance to come for some therapy sessions and to get involved in the family group. I went and thought at the time it was all too much. It just wasn’t for me.“A few years later I thought about it and went back. I met the other members and we have been best friends ever since.“The thing is we know exactly how each other feels. You can’t explain it to anyone  how it feels to lose a child.“There is one woman in the group who lost three sons and another who has lost two.”Anne joined the group six years ago when her son Brogue died.“For me, the group provides great friendship for me and I enjoy coming every week,” she explained.“When it is my son’s birthday or the anniversary of his death, sometimes I don’t feel like leaving the house but I would never miss a group meeting on a Wednesday night.“Really, without this group I don’t think I would be doing as well as I am today.“Every week, I look forward to a Wednesday night to come along and meet with people I now class as my friends.”As well as exchanging their own personal stories of heartbreak and loss, PIPS Family Group is much more than sharing their loss.Every year, members save up to fund a four-day holiday abroad with previous destinations including Amsterdam, Malta and Portugal. They also have regular days out, shopping trips and an annual Christmas dinner.“I think the social aspect of the group is very important,” added Patricia. It is not all miserable and we all enjoy our holidays and day trips to just get away from it all. We have all become really good friends.“We work closely with New Lodge Arts doing things like arts and crafts and doing social things with them really gives us all a bit of a lt.“Losing a loved one is dferent for each person. I understand the group might not be for everyone.“We all just sit and chat. We can talk openly about our loved ones we have lost and it helps us remember the good and happy times.”Due to renovation work at PIPS Antrim Road offices, the family group recently got good news of a room available in Tesco in Cityside, Yorkgate, where their weekly meetings will be held for the foreseeable future.Despite the success of the group, Patricia would like to see a similar group set up for men so that men can talk to each other about the subject.“The suicide rate in North Belfast is terrible. It is an epidemic,” she said.“We badly need a similar group like ourselves, but for men so that they can too talk to each other.“We have welcomed men before but some felt it just was not the setting for them.“I wish a man out there would do something. Men need to be talking.“As for our group, it is great to have this new room in Tesco. It is a good size and a lovely room.”PIPS Family Group are open to welcome new members.

In April, he took up the head chef post at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where he had previously worked as a Senior Sous Chef before a seven-year spell working abroad. Although his new role may be viewed as a veritable homecoming, it could well be his most exciting challenge yet.Liam first started his career in the industry working as a waiter in the Europa Hotel – a summer job that would soon see him step behind the line in the kitchen. Reflecting on those early days, the Clonard man said: “The passion of the chefs had for food, the flavours and the way they were plating stuff up really inspired me. It was good to see that buzz in the kitchen.“Yes, it is a stressful environment, but the guys all have fun. They all work towards one goal and they’re all one big family. It doesn’t matter what kitchen you go into, they’re all family –one person goes down they all go down, which just shows the teamwork. When I first watched the guys in the Europa it just bit me and I wanted to be a chef after that.”Liam’s flair for cooking and his desire to learn inspired him to gain chef’s qualications, and garnered further opportunities including the chance to work at the inimitable James Street South.He later went to work at the Malone Lodge Hotel, where his skills brought critical acclaim in  he became one of six finalists in prestigious European Chef of the Year Awards. Liam was the only chef in the finals from a non-Michelin starred restaurant and eventually picked up a bronze award for his five-course menu that showcased the best local and seasonal produce. His passion for seasonality and high-quality produce is something that has stuck with him to this day.“I like to stick to the classics,” he explained.“Classics are classics for a reason. Sometimes I’ll twist it as best as I can, but I always try to keep the flavours clean and seasonal. It’s basically just good food that everybody can enjoy. It doesn’t matter what your dietary requirement, we can cater for it.“We’ll always try to make a dish that is gluten free or dairy free so that we don’t have to tell people they can’t have it. We’ll twist a classic dish to more clean or refined flavours so that everybody can enjoy it.”When Liam left Belfast for Guernsey seven years ago he felt it may well have been for good. His move brought success, of course – he headed the team at Guernsey’s most popular restaurant, the Slaughterhouse – however, when the Malone Lodge offered him a new opportunity it was a challenge he could not pass up, and one he is meeting with his typical enthusiasm for food.“I’ve been bringing seasonality back into the restaurant. I’ve been making Macklin’s Bar back into a bar where people can come for a few pints and have chicken, ribs – bringing back real pub grub,” he said.“We’re making sure the lobby is buzzing again with people enjoying scones, teas, coffees and paninis – just having a bit to eat and drink and relaxing.“We’re bringing the restaurant back to what it was a nice hotel restaurant that is there for families, kids, and everybody so that they can have a nice sit down meal. It’s not just for customers who are staying in the hotel – it’s for the people of the area, people from all over Belfast, or people just visiting.”He continued: “The response has been very very good. I’ve come in at a crazy time with tour groups coming in, we’ve had holy communions coming in, but the feedback has all been positive. People like what they see happening and what they’re getting, and they like that they are getting good value for money.”Although Liam felt he might live in his home city again, he insists hiswas the right move. With Belfast’s ever growing food culture and tourism industry, it could not have come at a better time.“Belfast has always been a booming city – it’s basically like a mini London,” he said.“It is always evolving and the food is always evolving. We have some amazing chefs. You have people like Stevie Tolman, who is a Michelin starred chef at OX – I worked with him in James Street South – I think it’s amazing what he does. Every chef bouncing off each other is the whole point of it.“I think it’s brilliant for Belfast’s tourism and the city as a whole. We’re able to show how we’re moving forward to a better place. You can actually go out now and enjoy a nice meal. When I was younger you maybe went out for your communion and you were luckyyou got a steak. People are now trying dferent things, they’re experimenting with food, and they are opening their minds to the dferent things you can eat. There are a lot of Asian restaurants and a lot of other multicultural restaurants in Belfast, which brings a lot of passion and a lot of enjoyment for everybody.”He continued: “I’m happy that I’ve been asked to come back and take over the kitchen. It brings a lot of pride because I was here when it was the old restaurant and then I was here when it got done up.“It’s good to be able to show these guys in the kitchen where hard work gets you and what we can do together. I want to give a bit of guidance and teach them things that I’ve learned and the stuff that I’m still learning. I’ve been away for seven years, but I’m proud to be back. I would have come back maybe once a year, but I’ve always missed Belfast and I’ve always been a West Belfast boy, so I’m glad I got the opportunity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid would make grand gesture to irish government by covering costs of new digitised border in ireland","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr Javid continued: \"In my departmentat the moment Ive got border force and weve done work for months on what an alternative to that arrangement could look like and whats missing is that good will. \"What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. \"I think it could be done in a couple of years but I think we could cover their costs.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38163421.ece/9197d/AUTOCROP/w620h342/plaza.jpg","title":"belfast benefit centre staff spat out of windows and hurled objects onto the street below","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is clear to us that the Northern Ireland political parties wish to see the institutions of the Belfast   Good Friday Agreement restored, but operating on a more credible and sustainable basis. \"While broad consensus has been reached on some issues, other areas remain to be resolved.\"The Secretary of State and Tánaiste believe that there is a genuine but narrow window of opportunity to reach agreement in the immediate period ahead and that it is essential to continue and intensy talks to this end.\"As Prime Minister and Taoiseach, we will continue to monitor this progress closely.  \"We believe it is imperative that the parties now move without delay to engaging substantively on the shape of a final agreement.\"The DUP and Sinn Fein have so far been unable to come to agreement on a series of issues, including same-sex marriage, language rights and legacy issues.Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald said: “We are now at the end of this phase of the talks. All parties and both governments have shared their positions and all agree on the need to re-establish the power sharing institutions of the Good Friday Agreement.“The next phase of talks must move from the aspiration to re-establish the institutions to actually reaching an agreement that delivers for all. “I believe that progress is possible and necessary. It will be found in implementing our existing agreements, respecting the equality of all and recognising the rights of one section of the community does not diminish the rights of others.\""},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Seoul’s spy service has said it could not confirm Friday’s report of a possible purge, while the presidential Blue House cautioned against “hasty judgments or comments”.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters in Berlin that he had seen the report and the US was “doing our best to check it out”.The report came at a delicate time for diplomacy as North Korea in past weeks has tested short-range missiles and issued belligerent rhetoric toward American and South Korean officials.

It is definitely an iconic part of the lough.In the late s, maritime archaeologist Thomas McErlean and a team from Ulster University stumbled upon the worldrsquos earliest known tide mill during an excavation at Strangford Lough.Discovered close to the remains of Nendrum Monastery on Mahee Island, Thomas recalls the signicance of unearthing this medieval tide mill.Thomas says: ldquoThis was a site we got so excited about, we knew we were changing the course of Irish archaeology and indeedhellip industrial archaeology. We were breaking new ground and it was absolutely wonderful.In recent times, Strangford Lough has become an important site for tidal energy research and in  the worldrsquos first commercial tidal turbine was built near Portaferry.The turbine is now being decommissioned and local marine expert Simon Rogers, who is working on the removal, reveals the impact the tide has on operations.

Based on a five acre site at Kennedyrsquos Lake, the retreat has been visited by disabled groups who abide by the ethos of lsquofishing for funrsquo.No lead weights or barbs are allowed. Once a fish is caught and photographed it is released back into the lake.Robert explains that with the help of his close aide and fellow veteran, Nigel Cree, who is a director of Letrsquos Do Veterans Support, the net has been widened and that an invitation is being extended to anyone within the local community who wants to try out fishing.While battling to overcome his disability, Robert discovered there was little or no help for disabled veterans available in his community.Facing an interminable series of bad news on his journey to recovery he viewed the opportunity to be given a role in the British Limbless Ex-Servicemenrsquos Association as his saving grace.Robert said: ldquoWhen I got involved I saw people much worse off than myself. Some veterans had catastrophic injuries. I began to gain qualications in helping other people in the same situation as me. This helped me with my own recovery and give me a focus.ldquoMy house is down by the lake. One evening I was sitting observing how peaceful it was and it got me thinking about how I could put the lake to good use. In hindsight, the idea saved me from myself.ldquoI got a small team involved and before we knew it we had been successful in attracting funding to construct a car park, create fishing stands and a foot bridge, stock the lake with indigenous course fish and install an eco-toilet with disabled access.ldquoThere was no stopping half way through and the gamble has paid off with a successful opening and an encouraging demand for bookings growing each day.Robert describes himself as ldquonot being a lsquotea and biscuits man and doesnrsquot like to stand on ceremony.He continued: ldquoI have been helped by a devoted team of helpers and I would like to pay tribute to each of them and I dedicate this achievement to them and the three other veterans I started with who gave me great encouragement.ldquoIrsquod also like to thank Alpha Concrete, Hamilton Brothers and Cunningham Stone who were exceptional in their work with memorial plaques which have been erected.Robert said he hopes to provide fishing workshops in the near future and to get more people using the retreat.He added: ldquoA lot of time and money has been invested and when strangers visit we would ask them to adhere to the rules. They can contact me to book a session and pay a minimum day fee.For more information on Clough fishing retreat and for other initiatives which Letrsquos Do Veterans Support carry out, visit www.letsdoevents.info or contact Robert on  ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Event marking Men’s Health Week  ","story":"THE St Patrick Centre in Downpatrick is hosting a special event next month to mark Menrsquos Health Week.Between June  and June , the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint will feature an exhibition of art, craft and woodwork by members of the townrsquos Menrsquos Shed.The shedders are busily preparing for the exhibition with visitors welcome to view the work on display and learn about the work of the organisation in the community.The Menrsquos Shed aims to promote positive mental health and wellbeing to men over the age of  with the organisation offering a sizeable, well-equipped workshop at its Ballydugan Road industrial estate.There, shedders make wooden items to order such as garden seats and planters and they also produce items for community and conservation projects, like bird, bat and owl boxes for the National Trust.The Menrsquos Shed also offers opportunities for people to learn new practical skills including art, wood carving, clay, copper and leather work. The shedders also sing, cook and enjoy copious amounts of tea, biscuits and craic.And when not busy making things, the men love to get out and about visiting other Menrsquos Sheds which is a great way to network and exchange ideas.They also take part in day trips and have been involved in a new community engagement programme at Hillsborough Castle. The local shedders have also been given a fantastic tour of the grounds at Castle Ward to see their very own bird boxes being installed.The Downpatrick Menrsquos Shed is open on Tuesdays and Thursdays between .am and pm and on Friday between .am and .pm.For more information about the work of the organisation and how to get involved, telephone   or visit the Facebook Page, @MensShedDownpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Former chairman reflects on year in office  ","story":"FORMER Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin has described his term at the helm of the organisation as ldquoabsolutely fantastic.Mr Murnin mdash who lost his Slieve Croob seat to SDLP colleague Hugh Gallagher at the recent council election mdash served the area for four years, with his term as chairman a particular highlight.Reflecting on his year in office, which took him across Europe, the United States and the Far East, Mr Murnin said he spent almost  nights abroad and that there were many high points over the past  months.Addressing the local authorityrsquos annual meeting last week, the outgoing chairman thanked his party colleagues, fellow councillors and staff for their support.But Mr Murnin said the joy of his year in office was tinged with sadness as a number of people across the district tragically lost their lives, including a council staff member.ldquoThere were many highlights along the way, continued the chairman whose time at the helm concluded with a major charity walk which raised over pound, for Air Ambulance Northern Ireland, Harmony Community Trust and Newry Gateway Club.ldquoIt was great to start off my year with the districtrsquos special olympians and to be with them again near the end of my term in office. They represented the district so well at Irish level and again at world level in Abu Dhabi, bringing home medals.Mr Murnin also referred to the success of the inaugural Be Active Cup involving soccer teams from opposite sides of the council area. He instigated the tournament and hopes his successors will continue with it.He continued: ldquoDuring my year we had the opportunity to salute Dermot Curran, one of our long standing councillors mdash in fact the longest serving in Northern Ireland mdash with whom we enjoyed a fantastic night.ldquoIt was also a pleasure to lead our St Patrickrsquos Day parade in my home area which was really special for me. We then had the Innovation Nation event, bringing many young people from our schools together to see the exciting advances in the business opportunities that are presented to them going forward.Mr Murnin said he was also involved in helping fundraise for brave Bessbrook girl Ellen Treanor and six-year Alfie Pentony from Newry who will both travel to the US for pioneering health treatment.Sadly for the former chairman, rain intervened last August and the annual Festival of Flight international air show in Newcastle was cancelled.On a serious note, he told those in the chamber that a great responsibility comes with being a councillor.ldquoAs you strive to make this district the number one place to do business and set up a home, itrsquos worth remembering that those across the council chamber are not necessarily the enemy mdash you all must work together for the betterment of our district, he said.ldquoDuring my recent visit to New York, I was able to see how investors view the world and it was interesting to see where they see opportunities and risks, in particular.ldquoOne of those was climate risk and the importance of it, with businesses looking at it from an investors point of view. As a district, this is something that we need to take seriously, and not necessarily just rising sea levels.Mr Murnin believes that increased rainfall is going to make a dramatic dference to the way buildings and roads are designed, also highlighting the need to look at alternative energy forms.He added: ldquoBuilding for the future and how a modern city should look like will also be important. One thing that struck me looking out from the observation tower at the One World Center in New York was that the city is surprisingly green as so many of the buildings have roof top gardens and trees. This is something we should look to replicate where we can..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Foster sisters and Alex shine at schools’ event  ","story":"THE Newry Mourne and Down Primary Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships were held in Kilbroney Forest Park last Tuesday.Jodi Foster was first in the P girls and her sister Kari was second in the P girls.

His young  year-old jockey, Sean Armitage, was giving the horse a work-out gallop in preparation for the Sligo race meeting when he suddenly felt the horse jerk.Moments later they saw blood trickling down the neck of the horse and after finding a small hole they realised that a bullet had done the damage. The incident happened near the army camp.Mr Treacey, who lives at Ardglass Castle, reported the incident to police and investigations began immediately. However, they have not discovered who fired the bullet.ldquoThe future of the horse is very much in the balance, said an unhappy Mr Treacey. ldquoThe bullet is lodged close to the horsersquos spine and my vet has suggested a very tricky operation is needed to remove it.ldquoWorse still, it could easily have been my jockey who was hit. He was in the racing position on the horse and had the bullet been six inches higher it would have hit him in the head.A police spokesman confirmed the incident and said that it had been established that the horse had gunshot wounds, possibly from a . bullet.ldquoOur investigations are continuing and we hope to be in a position to establish whether it could have been a ricochet or a stray bullet from the firing range, or a deliberate shooting incident, he said.LEITRIM mdash Road racer Tom Herron, tragically killed at the North West meeting on Saturday, was buried beside Leitrim Presbyterian Church on Monday. The mourners included many of his racing colleagues, who had flown from the Isle of Man to be at the graveside.The funeral service was conducted by the Rev James Johnston, who referred to Herronrsquos many qualities and the determination which had taken him to the top.Herron was the third motorcycle ace from mid Down to die in race accidents.

Fortunately, the action only lasted for a limited period.PORTAFERRY mdash Declan Mackell sailed single-handed out of Portaferry on Sunday afternoon to go round the world. A handful of boats accompanied him out of Strangford Lough after he had enjoyed lunch at the Portaferry Hotel.ldquoYes, Irsquom probably mad, he admitted before he left. ldquoBut I see this outing as something that should satisfy my curiosity in the same way as my transatlantic trip last year.His -foot yacht dipped gently into the Irish Sea as the former carpenter tacked his way out of sight and got his self-steering gear into action for his first night at sea.Declan, who has prepared his boat over the last six months, will take in France, the Mediterranean, the Canaries, Atlantic and Pacic Oceans, Australia, New Zealand, Indian Ocean and Cape Hope before coming back to Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN mdash Castlewellan Library, formerly the Market House, was officially opened by Mr Peter OrsquoHagen, chairman of the South Eastern Education and Library Board, this week.Almost pound, was pumped into covering the building into a library and the Board agree that the expense was worth it.

Those that are successful are provided with financial support for one year only.It is a system that the chairwoman of the Bishopscourtrsquos playgroup is keen to see changed.Mrs Patricia Curran, who revealed that Tiny Toons recently missed out on Pathway funding by a narrow margin, said playgroups did a ldquomagnicent job, particularly in rural area where working parents rely heavily upon them.She said playgroups look after children at the most critical time in their development and need to be provided with financial certainty.A number of playgroups across the district revealed recently that they were organising additional fundraising activities to generate income and were appealing for donations of everyday essentials including toilet paper, wipes, photocopying paper and even bin bags.Mrs Curran revealed that Tiny Toons only found out about the strategic support fund by chance and while pleased the cash will pay staff wages over the summer, fresh funding applications will have to be made at the start of next year to cover costs.ldquoWhile we narrowly missed out on Pathway funding, we have secured other support from a fund which we knew nothing about, she continued.ldquoThe money we have secured will keep us ticking over. We are not saying everything is hunky dory as a result of this particular finance. We have money to pay for  childrenrsquos places from next September which is good. The money secured under the strategic support fund will pay our staff over July and August.Mrs Curran said that had the playgroup not been made aware of the strategic fund it would have been a ldquovery dferent story.ldquoWhile securing funding comes as a relief, it does not provide us with any degree of certainty. We will have to make a fresh application for Pathway funding at the start of next year and go through this process all over again, as we and others do every year, she continued.Mrs Curran said Tiny Toons and other playgroups across the district were operating in a ldquochallenging financial climate.ldquoThe provision of ring-fenced funding is vital for us, she declared. ldquoWhile things are fine for now, we know that come the New Year we will have to start filling in funding application forms again.ldquoRing-fenced funding for a two or three-year period would provide certainty and help playgroups operate in a climate where there would not be a cloud hanging over them.ldquoThe funding issue affects all those in the education sector and I read recently that one headmaster warned that his school could be forced to only open four days a week as it did not have enough money.Mrs Curran said that while strategic support funding has provided Tiny Toons with short term relief, guaranteed ring-fenced financial support would provide certainly and allow future planning.She added: ldquoGiven the current funding model, there is always uncertainty hanging over us. We are voluntary workers and we should not have this pressure on our heads. That said,we did not do this work, who  is going to do it ldquoNot many people want to do voluntary work any more because of the pressure involved.

But it’s not just agriculture in Northern Ireland that is totally consumed by the issue: the same also holds for farmers in Scotland. Andrew Warnock, from Lanarkshire, judged the sheep inter-breed classes at Ballymoney .William Hanna, from Ballymoney, with the Clydesdale yearling and Ballymoney Reserve Clydesdale Champion  - Mac Fin Queen of the Roses“The sheep industry will be every exposed to a no-deal Brexit,” he said.“Flockowners throughout the UK are very dependent on lamb exports to Europe for their survival. If tarfs were to be introduced on our lamb exports to countries like France, it could have a devastating impact on farm incomes here. “Sheep farmers in both Scotland and Northern Ireland would be affected in an equal manner under such circumstances.”Andrew continued: “Farmers just want certainty and many are deeply concerned about the way the Westminster government has mis-managed the Brexit discussions up to this point.”Left to right: Sam Harry McNeilly, Ballyclare, his father Stephen and Sheep Inter Breed Judge Andrew Warnock with the Texel and Inter-Breed Ewe Lamb Champion at Ballymoeny Show Meanwhile, Andrew was having a challenging day in the show rings.“The quality of the sheep entered for the show is exceptional,” he said.“The numbers entered are also very high.

But when, due to unionist influence, that line started to drt across the north east counties of Ireland it was described by nationalists as the mutilation of the Irish nation. So perhaps not as innocuous as Seanán claims. Might home rule have become a stepping stone to full Irish independence  Devolution for Scotland in  has not quenched the thirst of nationalists there for independence.Two peoples one island  John Redmond, the Irish Party leader, regarded as blasphemy the two nations theory — that some in Ireland see themselves as British is considered misguided in certain nationalist quarters. Unionists were forced to arrange partition to protect their own sense of nationhood. Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan unionists reluctantly agreed with this in . This was not an outcome unionists sought. But Irish republicanism was not far below the surface and its dash for glory post  resulted in the full international border we see today. It is not good enough to solely blame unionism for the border in Ireland. It takes two to make a border! When two human perspectives collide over the same piece of earth this is what can happen. I am putting a unionist perspective here which was the point of my initial response to Seanán. Generally we are poor at acknowledging other perspectives. In the last  years nationalists and unionists in Northern Ireland have shared the same history but there is little agreement on it. Would it not make future relationships betterwe could agree a past that both sides can sign up to  Now there’s a challenge.

Ahead of the first episode, Ruth told the News Letter: “I was nervous at the start about it coming on TV. Then whenever I saw the adverts it’s put me at ease a wee bit. Businesswoman and fashionista Shirley“We’ve seen a few clips but we don’t get to see the whole episodes until the public sees them.”While it’s been billed as Northern Ireland’s equivalent as TOWIE and Made In Cha the characters come across as being a lot more down to earth.Ruth, , said: “It’s just the way we are everyday. People in Co Tyrone are very genuine.“It might come across as we all know each other but a lot of the people in the show I hadn’t met until we came together for the programme.Country singer Neil“I’d never met Bobby or Lynda or Audrey or Melvin. We’re all friendly now.“Even when I met them and the cameras weren’t on we got on really well. Bobby constantly had me in stitches. He could have his own show.“We’re from Dungannon. Lynda is Omagh direction, Audrey I think she’s up by Clogher.\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Entry rules for the Downpatrick races are listed Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The way it’s filmed it might seem that we live closer together.”Ruth said she had some dficulties with the cameras to begin with but soon found her feet: “When it was being filmed they said, ‘pretend we’re not here’. At the start I was accidentally looking into the lens. After a while, after the second or third time, you do forget the cameras are there.” Ruth explained how she got involved with the programme which was filmed at the start of last summer: “They went to my friend’s salon and they were giving out flyers trying to find someone who comes from a farming background and is also into the beauty and all. Helen said about me and passed on my details. They contacted me and I said I’d be interested, it sounds like great craic.”Ruth revealed that it wasn’t technically her TV debut: “When I was in primary school I was in school choir of the year, but that was in a choir and I’m a blur.”In one scene, Ruth who is a member of a gun club takes two of her friends shooting: “Hollie had shot once before, Helen had never shot in her le. We just sort of thought we’d go for the craic. That’s the sort of thing that we did for the show. It’s not like reality shows were they make drama for the sake of it.”Ruth described herself as “a part time farmer, part time beautician and a full time mum”. She said: “Maisie is two this week. She’s not in the show but I do talk about her.“I have a boyfriend, we’re not married or engaged. We’ve been going out for three and half years and we’ve been friends since we were .”During her early days as beautician she needed someone to practice on. Cue her dad John: “When I was training as a beautician I had to practice eyebrow waxing. I got my kit and asked dad would he let me practice. I think I got one strip pulled off and he stopped me. He said he’d been in enough accidents on the farm but that was by the far the worst. He ended up with one bushy eyebrow and one normal one.”She added: “My oldest brother John is a full time farmer. He’s won’t be on the show, he’s a bit shy. He works on the farm with my dad and my dad’s friend Billy.“My mumhelps out on the farm before her own job as a classroom assistant in a special needs school.”Ruth appears in the show alongside her brother Neil. As a duo they’re used to being in the limelight together.She said: “Neil’s a country singer. We used to sing together. We were a two-piece band then I went to Australia for a year and he went out on his own.“He started to make it really well on his own so I left him to it. I started a new job as a beautician and helped my dad out on the farm.”So has she got the bitten by the TV bug “It’s was really good craic,” she said. “If there was a second series and they asked me to be in it, I’d definitely say yes. I suppose they’re waiting to see how the first series goes.”She added: “The first night the trailer was on TV quite a lot of people videoed it and sent it to me on Snapchat. A lot of people have taken an interest.”try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing -

First, months of intensive air attacks were carried out against roads, railways and bridges all over France to make it dficult for the Germans to move reinforcements to Normandy.Secondly, an elaborate deception plan had been put in place to convince the Germans that the Pas de Calaisrather than Normandy would be the focus of the Allied invasion.After the invasion the Allies continued this strategy to persuade the Germans that the landings in Normandy were simply a feint so that they would retain signicant forces in the Pas de Calais.Yet even meticulous planning is no guarantee of success. Admiral Sir Bertram Ramsay, the Royal Navy officer in overall charge of the naval dimension of D-Day, confided to his diary: ‘We shall require all the help God can give us.’He added: ‘I cannot believe that this will not be forthcoming.’ That same evening Winston Churchill told his we: ‘Do you realise that by the time you wake up in the morning, , men may have been killed ’The sheer scale of the operation to liberate Europe was staggering: nearly , landing ships and assault craft were escorted by six battleships, four monitors,  cruisers,  destroyers,  escort vessels and  minesweepers.The timing of the invasion was one of the greatest challenges faced by the Allied High Command during the war.Dr James Stagg, the UK’s leading meteorologist, carried an immense burden of responsibility: he had to analyse the complex meteorological data to avoid rough seas, low cloud and bad visibility.Amphibious operations are notoriously dficult. The British were haunted by the fear of failure and a repetition of the grim disaster at Dieppe in August . The Americans, though more bullish, had been obliged to learn many harsh lessons in North Africa, Sicily and Italy.NI athlete Erin McConnell happy to rise before am to achieve Olympic dream Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Hitler believed he could defeat the invasion and knock the British and Americans out of the war and concentrate his attention on the war in the east.The Führer placed great faith in the so-called Atlantic Wall whereas Rundstedt, the German commander-in-chief West, was much closer to the mark when he described it as ‘just a piece of cheap bluff’.There were five landing beaches designatedUtah, Omaha, Gold, Juno and Sword. Utah and Omaha were allocated to the US First Army and the remaining three were allocated to the British and Canadian troops of the British Second Army.Two US airborne isions landed by parachute and glider inland from Utah and one British airborne ision was deployed on the east flank of Sword.Altogether , British and Canadian troops and , US troops were landed on D-Day. There were about , British and Canadian casualties, and , US ones.An unusually high proportion of these were killed rather than wounded.Although the Allies did not accomplish all their objectives on the first day, they had not been driven back into the sea and they had secured a foothold on continental Europe that they gradually expanded with the capture of Cherbourg on June  and of Caen on July .The break-out from the beachheads proved much more dficult and costly than expected. Indeed, the battle for Normandy made the casualties suffered on D-Day appear light in comparison.The terrain of mixed woodland and pasture with twisty side-roads and lanes bounded on both sides by banks surmounted with high thick hedgerows greatly assisted the German defenders.A trooper in the Sherwood Yeomanry told a newly arrived colleague: ‘You’ll get a shock after the desert. We could see the buggers and they could see us. Here they can see us but I’ll be buggeredwe can see them.’Furthermore, the Germans fought with great cunning and ferocity. An American officer bitterly observed: ‘The Germans haven’t much left but they sure as hell know how to use it.’The Royal Ulster Rles enjoys the unique distinction of having both its regular battalions land in Normandy on D-Day, one by air and one on the beaches.A lieutenant in the nd Royal Ulster Rles overheard one of his troops comment on the overhead arrival of their sister unit by glider: ‘I suppose that’s what the st Battalion calls a route march.’The nd Royal Ulster Rles fought their way into the village of Cambes but were forced to retreat by a newly arrived detachment of th SS Hitlerjugend. They had to leave their wounded in a ditch outside the village where they were probably murdered by the Hitlerjugend.After stf further fighting the Ulster Rles succeeded in retaking the village and dug in. When they counted their casualties, they found that they had lost  officers and  NCOs and other ranks.The King’s Own Scottish Borderers came up at dusk to reinforce the depleted battalion just as a sudden mortar ‘stonk’ began.One of the Jocks, taking cover, jumped into the nearest trench, unwittingly clapped the commanding officer of the Ulster Rles on the back and observed, ‘Well, Paddy, you old bastard, we never expected to see you again.’It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of the success of D-Day.If the invasion of Europe had failed, as it might well have done , for example, it had coincided with violent storm of June - , the Red Army might have advanced well beyond the Oder-Neise line and reached not only the Rhine but the Atlantic seaboard.Both the map and history of post-war Europe would have been radically dferent.try catch  TrendingPolice searching for missing N.I. man Ryan Smyth find bodyTT : Ian Hutchinson escapes serious injury following high-speed crash in qualyingN.I. child reported missing -

Erin, , said: “I train about  plus hours a week which includes my swimming, cycling and running. That also includes strength and conditioning classes and yoga. “You need to be very disciplined. It becomes a way of le. It’s not a sacrice.“I don’t know any dferent. Sport has always been part of my le. “To me it’s not giving up anything, it’s about striking a balance. “A lot of the time my friends are going out partying and I can’t partake in that because I need to be in bed early to be up at  to five and be sharp for training the next morning.“It’s all about trusting the process and knowing that triathlon for me is a marathon and not a sprint. I need to be at this for years to come to reach my goals.“The end goal is to get on to the international triathlon circuit, definitely the Commonwealth Games in  in Birmingham. The ultimate goal would be the Olympics, hopefully Paris . It would be amazing to reach that goal.”The former Strathearn pupil, now attending SERC in Bangor studying sport and exercise science, hopes to go to Jordanstown next year.Askedshe got to spend much time with friends and family, Erin said: “I do get a day off here and there and I do make sure I get completely out of sport. Once or twice a year I get a couple of days to go away with my family. I try to see my friends as much as I can. Most of them are very understanding.“I don’t get much downtime but when I do I go out with my friends for dinner or the cinema. I do go out on special occasions. I do have a le outside sport.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

She said: “It has been another great show, and we’ve been very lucky with the weather. “A big thank you to everyone who contributed to the success of our th annual show, especially ABC Council, Translink and principal sponsor ABP. We are also indebted to the many iniduals who give so freely of their time to organise the show.”The cattle and sheep sections attracted a iety of continental, native and traditional breeds.Leading the cattle parade and securing the award for the supreme champion of champions was the Holstein cow Glasson Goldfish Form Erle VG from Philip and Simon Haffey’s -cow herd at Portadown. A second prize winner at Balmoral Show, she calved her third in March and is producing  litres of milk every day. Originating from the noted Erle family at Smiddiehill, her granddam was the ,gns Field of Dreams Formation Erle. The Haffey family have won seven successive Holstein championships at Lurgan Show. Interbreed cattle judge Cyril Millar, from Coleraine, described the overall show champion as a spectacular specimen of the breed. “It’s never an easy task judging beef cattle against dairy cattle, and the exhibitors deserve credit for putting on a tremendous show of quality animals. “Today’s overall winner is a flashy dairy cow with great power and scope. She has a big open frame, a well attached udder, and walks well on sound legs and feet.”Taking the reserve supreme award was the interbreed beef winner, an Aberdeen Angus heer from Richard and Fiona McKeown’s Herd at Templepatrick. This home-bred heer was born in April , and secured the reserve breed titles at Balmoral and Lurgan.  Cyril Millar added: “This heer is a peach of a beast, and a very close second. She oozes breed character from head to toe, and has great conformation and muscle.”Runner-up in the interbreed beef line-up was the two-year-old Charolais heer Summervilla Nikki exhibited by Nigel and Gail Matchett from Portadown.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged. EE is bringing the connectivity to the city from May , alongside London, Edinburgh, Cardf, Birmingham and Manchester. While still at an early phase, with further roll-out a longer term project, EE says it expects customers in Belfast to “experience an increase in speeds of around -Mbps even in the busiest areas”. “Some customers will break the one gigabit-per-second milestone on their G smartphones. The fastest speed possible when EE launched G in  was just Mbps.” Marc Allera, chief executive, of BT’s consumer ision, says: “This is the start of the UK’s G journey and great news for our customers that want and need the best connections. We’ve started with G in some of the busiest parts of the UK, the widest range of G devices in the UK, and plans that give customers the best mobile connection and great benefits. “We’re adding G to the UK’s number one G network to increase reliability, increase speeds, and keep our customers connected where they need it most.  “G will create new experiences with augmented reality, make our customers’ lives easier, and help launch entirely new businesses that we haven’t even imagined. We’re upgrading more than  sites to G every month from today to connect more places to what G can enable.” Suzanne Wylie, chief executive of Belfast Council, said: “Digital connectivity is at the heart of our strategy for the growth of Belfast. G is key to making our ambitions a reality. It will drive our economy forward and enable Belfast to thrive in the fourth industrial revolution. Being one of the first G enabled cities in the UK is an exciting prospect for us, and will bring our businesses and citizens the best mobile connectivity in Europe. “G connectivity will ensure our city remains competitive, indigenous businesses grow and big global brands continue to build their businesses in Belfast and support our ongoing digital advancement.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sign_1.jpg","title":"across the borderline export focus","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business The export market is booming in cross-border areas in and around Newry, but how will things change post-Brexit  Pavel Barter checks out the pulse of businesses in the region As the morning sun illuminates the shores of Carlingford Lough in Co Down, a team of workers carry bags of oysters from the water to the beach. They toss, turn, and grade the shellfish according to size, before ing them to the seabed. Across the Lough we can see the Cooley Peninsula and Co Louth. In the Brexit border debate, this is ground zero.Growing oysters takes three years, says Darren Cunningham, owner of Killowen Shellfish, and he exports stock every week. “It leaves on a Friday evening at around pm, and % is exported to France. It goes through Dublin and Rosslare to the top oyster buyer in Europe. The oysters are in purication tanks in France by Sunday evening. That’s how quick it is.” Carlingford Oysters then travel to restaurants in Paris and other European capitals. How is business  “Very good,” Darren says. “We sold nearly  tonnes of oyster last year. Two tonnes went to China and the rest to France.” Is there much competition  “Not for us. We’re the talk at the minute. We have the best stuff.”Darren and his team work next to Ballyedmond Estate, the family home of the late Edward Haughey, founder of Norbrook, one of the world’s leading veterinary pharmaceutical companies. If you travel further up the lough – past Warrenpoint, home to Northern Ireland’s second largest port – you will reach Newry, where Norbrook is based.Killowen Shellfish and Norbrook, which generated an operating profit of £.m in the year to August , are very dferent businesses, yet both speak the common language of exports. There are around , VAT registered businesses in the greater Newry area and many of them are accustomed to criss-crossing the border.“We have a number of major global players based here in Newry who supply goods across the world,” Colm Shannon, chief executive of Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade says.He name-checks MJM Marine, a leader in the global marine industry, which employs  people in three offices across Europe. “Equally, we have a number of smaller companies who are involved in north-south trade. That’s usually the first step into the export market.”Exports are the essence of business for Re-Gen Waste, a Newry firm established in  by five siblings. Re-Gen began by recycling paper, cardboard, tin and plastics, before graduating to municipal waste and black bin waste. The family developed their own purpose-built facility in Newry, creating a business that generates millions. Its work is spread across Northern Ireland, the Republic and rest of the UK.According to John Doherty, a director at the business, Re-Gen “exports hundreds of tonnes across the border every day. We’re the fourth largest recycler in the Republic.” Its recycled products are exported to almost  countries around the globe. Re-Gen is not alone. Other successful Newry exporters include FM Environmental Group, which has offices in Malta and the Middle East. In , Newry’s BM Steel landed new business, in a deal worth £m, in the Netherlands and Great Britain. Around Noon, a producer of high-quality sandwiches, employs  people and has made acquisitions in Dublin and London. Newry-based construction firm mac-group is another all-island operation. In , it completed a £m refurbishment of River House, a -storey building in Belfast. Simultaneously, it was working the new Barclays headquarters in Dublin. “We employ over  people, across four dferent offices,” Brendan Moley, group interiors managing director at mac-group says. “The Newry office has  full time people. A lot of those staff members support projects in Dublin, London and Birmingham. There’s a lot of commuting back and forth across the border. We are trading in cross border services on a daily basis, but we’re also heavily involved in products and goods.”Although GB is Northern Ireland’s biggest external market, businesses in the Newry region are accustomed to cross border trade due to their geographical location. “We’ve always looked at Newry as being half way between Belfast and Dublin,” Brendan says. “You can get to Dublin Airport in  minutes from here. The talent available within the Newry market, in terms of some of staff, skill-set and knowledge, is extremely beneficial as well.”Some businesses fear that a hard border, in the event of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, will cause delays. According to Darren Cunningham, only a few hundred lorries crossed the border every day in . That number is around , today. “A minute delay can knock everyone back hours,” he says. “My oysters can’t hold their breath forever. They’re a living creature. They only have a certain amount of time. The quicker they get to France, the better condition they’re in.”Re-Gen operates its own transport department. “Currently we send a lorry to Dublin twice in a day to collect materials,” John Doherty says. “If there is a delay at the border, you are likely require a second lorry. The cost of taking everything from the Republic to the north doubles.”Technology, such as unmanned border posts equipped with cameras, would be unlikely to solve the problem, suggests Brendan. “Any type of border control will impact business. Being from the border area myself, knowing how many crossings there are, I think it would be absolutely impossible to police it in any sensible way.”Newry businesses fear they will face mountains of costly paperwork post-Brexit. There may also be compliance issues, such as food traceability dficulties for food producers like Killowen Shellfish, construction product regulations for mac-group, or paper work for Re-Gen’s haulage drivers, whose Certicates of Professional Competencemay not be to be recognised in a post-Brexit EU. The Government has suggested imposing zero tarfs on goods from the EU in the event of no deal. Newry businesses believe this would put them at a competitive disadvantage. “The business community has expressed concerns that Northern Ireland will become a back door into the UK market for goods coming from the EU,” Colm Shannon says. “History tells you when you have iation of tarfs on the border, that’s an opportunity for smuggling.”Staff recruitment is another concern at Re-Gen, which has a -strong workforce. “We’re already finding it dficult to recruit staff,” John says. “Often, the people we’re hiring are seasonal and foreign workers. It’s the same for the agricultural industry, hotels...”But what about the arguments that a managed no-deal could be good for business  Firms would still have access to EU markets under WTO rules. Furthermore, the UK might strike lucrative trade deals in the years to come. Businesses around Newry are not buying this. Certainly not Norbrook, which has “an integrated supply chain, with a global supply base, which relies on frictionless trade,” according to Liam Nagle, the company boss.Uncertainty reigns for export businesses in the Newry area. “The chaotic nature in which this has been managed has restricted companies like ourselves from planning for the future,” Brendan Moley says. “It’s one  dawn after another.”Darren Cunningham, looking across the water to where Co Louth is starting to feel very far away, says: “A lot of people are in complete disbelief and don’t think it’s going to happen. I can’t get my head around it at all. That’s the truth.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jannine_1.jpg","title":"my day jannine waddell","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Jannine Waddell MBE Position: Managing director at Waddell Media .amMy alarm goes off and I instantly check the weatherand have a quick look at emails that have come in overnight.
