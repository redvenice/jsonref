[{"url":null,"title":"PIERS MORGAN Harry Meghan brought negative press yourselves","story":"Share this article I suspect this staggeringly privileged multi-millionaire prince\u0027s main worry each morning is instructing his servants in his palatial home as to how he wants his breakfast eggs cooked.But when you marry a Hollywood actress, then unfortunately, this kind of pathetic woe-is-me-me-me attitude often comes with the territory.In the next part of his statement, Harry really upped the pity ante, invoking the memory of his late mother Princess Diana.\u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027Wow.I understand why Harry dislikes the press after what happened to his mother, truly I do.Her death must have been incredibly hard for him to take as a 12-year-old boy.But let\u0027s be very clear - the press didn\u0027t kill Diana, a speeding drunk-driver killed Diana.And if she hadn\u0027t recklessly abandoned her usual royal protection officers and drivers, she\u0027d probably still be alive today.         Prince Harry, and Meghan pose with their newborn son Archie on May 8 this year. The Duke of Sussex accused the press of \u0027bullying\u0027 and \u0027relentless propaganda\u0027Yes, she was the subject of huge press attention, but speaking from personal experience as a newspaper editor at the time, I can assure you she played the media game just as ruthlessly as we played it with her.She was the biggest star in the world, and would happily and regularly collude with the papers when it suited her – just as Meghan happily and regularly colludes with magazines like People and Vogue when it suits her.But with all due respect to Ms Markle, she\u0027s not in the same league as Diana in terms of fame.So for Harry to compare them in this way is both wrong and slightly distasteful. (And before the inevitable howls of \u0027you\u0027ve no idea what it\u0027s like to lose a parent young\u0027 pour in, let me just point out that my father died when I was very young.)         Meghan was guest editor of September\u0027s Vogue, dedicating it to 15 \u0027fearless women,\u0027 including Jane Fonda, Jacinda Ardern and Greta ThunbergHe added that he has been \u0027witness to her private suffering for too long\u0027 and \u0027to stand back and do nothing would be contrary to everything we believe in.\u0027Hmmm.It was only a few weeks ago that Meghan was telling people at a function that she never reads any press about herself. So how would she know what the press is saying, let alone suffer from it?As I\u0027ve often said, I have little time for Meghan after she ghosted me as a friend the moment she first met Harry. It signified a worrying social-climbing character trait that has seen her ditch many friends and almost all her family if she feels they may threaten her ferociously ambitious rise up the celebrity ladder.But what I think of her personally is irrelevant to the situation that actually sparked this battle with the media, and that is the breakdown of her relationship with her father.There\u0027s no doubt that Thomas Markle made a big mistake in stunting photos with the paparazzi before his daughter\u0027s wedding, as he has admitted himself.But did that really warrant him being banished forever in such a heartless manner?It\u0027s utterly extraordinary that Harry has never met his father-in-law, and that Meghan has now cut him out of her life.         Harry referenced his mother Princess Diana in his statement: \u0027My deepest fear is history repeating itself,\u0027 he fumed, \u0027I\u0027ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.\u0027 He is seen above with her and Prince William I\u0027ve interviewed Thomas several times and found him to be a very normal and nice, if naïve, guy who just had no idea how to handle the massive vicarious fame that instantly came his way after Meghan announced she was engaged to a British Prince.Rather then help him, they savagely punished him for a silly mistake, and his erratic behaviour ever since suggests a father deeply hurt and bemused by losing any contact with the daughter he brought up with such love and care.Thomas Markle gave Meghan\u0027s letter to the Mail on Sunday because he wanted to correct what he believed was misleading criticism of him in People magazine from Meghan\u0027s friends.Judge him all you like for it, but imagine how tough the past few years have been for him too? He has never even met his own grandchild.Thomas has been no angel in this family wrangle, but nor is he the devil.And he should be allowed the freedom of speech to defend himself.Rather than going to war with the press in this absurd manner, Harry should clamber down off his hysterical hothead high horse and repair the real running sore causing Meghan\u0027s distress – by making peace with her father. "},{"url":null,"title":"Whistle blower registered Democrat new leak reveals","story":"Share this articleJake Tapper on Twitter: \u0026quotBreaking — A source familiar with the investigation prompted by the whistleblower tells me that the “indicia of bias of an arguable political bias on the part“ of the whistleblower referred to by the In ..."},{"url":null,"title":"Cricket tournament meant inspire children players kits sport JUNK FOOD logos","story":"Share this article The England and Wales Cricket Board previewed the teams\u0027 kits yesterday, all of which carry brands from KP Snacks. Shirts for Birmingham Phoenix players have a logo for Butterkist popcorn – which contains more than half an 11-year-old child\u0027s recommended daily allowance of sugar in one 30g serving. Caroline Cerny of campaign group the Obesity Health Alliance said the sponsorship would fuel the \u0027tide of junk food advertising\u0027 aimed at children. \u0027These types of partnerships create a really unhelpful association between healthy sports and unhealthy foods,\u0027 she said. Rob Calder, commercial boss of The Hundred, said the contest \u0027will offer world-class cricket for every family and KP Snacks share that vision\u0027. Kevin McNair of KP Snacks said it was encouraging families to be more active. "},{"url":null,"title":"Professional dancer West End Lion King sues Disney 80 000 following injury","story":"Share this article Ms Standish trained at prestigious dance school LABAN and the Bird College of musical theatre after her gymnastics career ended.On an online blog, she describes how, whilst she was a stage technician on the West End production, she landed \u0027a dream job as a gymnast and acrobat on a show in Dubai\u0027.\u0027I was going, the dream was real, then an accident at work caused a major shoulder injury and I was back to square one,\u0027 she said.A trial of the case is set to go ahead next summer over three days.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Cyclist takes BMW driver task parking middle road blocking bus","story":"Share this article The now infamous encounter saw Pickering bark at Steve Middleton \u0027Do you know who I am?\u0027, before yelling his name three times. In this latest motor encounter, Mr Joseph also criticises the BMW driver for using his phone while sitting in his car and holding up the bus - and several other cars. But the motorist hits back: \u0027Am I driving?\u0027 To which Mr Joseph responds: \u0027An officer of the law would tell you, you\u0027re sitting in a vehicle with the engine running.\u0027 Before the motorist cuts in and says: \u0027Are you an officer of the law?\u0027 But Mr Joseph continues: \u0027I know the law and so do you, and you know that what you\u0027re doing here is wrong.\u0027         The BMW driver appears to have been trying to overtake a row of parked cars on his side of the road when he came across the bus - and refused to reverse back to allow it through         The cyclist later commented on the footage saying the BMW driver moved - but only after another person asked him to revers back (pictured, vehicles held up by the motorist)The two continue to squabble with each other, before Mr Joseph threatens to \u0027drag him out\u0027 - and later says: \u0027Do you think you\u0027re a hard man do you?

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

John Lewis, which has about 20 stores in covered shopping centres, said it had resorted to the action to try to get its landlords to help stop the service charge increases.“At a time when we are doing everything we can to reduce our cost base, we have unfortunately been faced with regular increases to the service charges we pay for some of our shops in shopping centres,” John Lewis said in a statement.John Lewis is seeking to get landlords to take on some of the service charge obligations during the fourth quarter, the most critical period of the year for retailers in the run-up to Christmas.The retailer is contractually bound to pay the service charge under the terms of lease arrangements with landlords, and withholding payments could lead to legal action by property owners to recover unpaid bills. John Lewis’s biggest landlords include Hammerson and Intu.Legal experts believe that the dire state of the high street gives John Lewis a strong hand in negotiations as landlords cannot threaten the company with repossession.“This is a very unusual move but it is reflective of John Lewis’s position in a challenging retail market,” said Richard Cressall, partner and commercial property expert at law firm Gordons. “Pretty much no other tenant would be in a position to take John Lewis’s anchor stores at shopping centres in this market or to create the footfall they do, which all but rules out the most severe potential remedy, repossession.”Cressall says landlords are likely to come to the negotiating table rather than face costly, lengthy court action.John Lewis said: “We are investing more in our current shop estate than ever before to do everything we can to encourage customers to grow footfall to our shops and we hope that our landlords will support us in continuing to do this.”Earlier this week, John Lewis Partnership, the parent company of John Lewis and Waitrose, announced a major restructure to merge management of its retail and supermarket operations to save £100m."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8715bbdd30f5cad4f9620a988331183e9cc926c/0_654_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4aed87e913f5a4e624a5c5869a93d69","title":"faces on the ferry an amsterdam commute a cartoon","story":"Artist Rachelle Meyer uses her 12 minute ferry commute from Amsterdam Noord to sketch her fellow commuters and the city’s changing seasonsI started sketching fellow passengers on the NDSM ferry after I moved to Amsterdam Noord, which is separated from the city centre by a body of water called the IJ. The trip takes about twelve minutes, and it seemed like a great drawing exercise for the mornings. I’d loosen up with a speedy pencil portrait on the boat, cycle to my studio, and finish it up with fineliners and markers over a cup of coffee. This daily doodling evolved into an interesting study of how we choose to spend our time. We’re all in this state of suspension on the ferry, floating on the water, in a limbo between destination points. I was particularly drawn to people who were absorbed in reading books. These “dedicated readers” remained quite still through the journey, and it’s a loving testimony to the power of print. This original tiny sketchbook filled up from January to May 2017.When I flipped back through the sketchbook, I discovered that it also told a story of time passing on a larger level as winter opened up into spring. This gave me the idea for the Faces on the Ferry art project, which consists of a film of the original sketchbook and sixteen silkscreen prints extracted from sketches made on the ferry over the course of a year, four for each season. The prints each use a four colour palette, with one colour that carries through to the following season. This creates a flow, expressing the observations I made about time, as well as a series of vivid modern portraits of the erse public of the ferries.The historic city centre of Amsterdam is a charming but well-known tourist destination, and I hope that my art project brings more attention to the north, specifically the NDSM area. The industrial history, cheap rent, and relatively open spaces have made it a haven for artists, similar to parts of Brooklyn in New York. A trip across the water is like a breath of fresh air, invigorating and memorable.Rachelle Meyer is an American illustrator and artist living in Amsterdam. Faces on the Ferry is being exhibited as an installation from 1-17 November in NDSM FUSE, Amsterdam Noord.

Yet he is the only one who can prevent Boris Johnson trashing BritainDeparting Tory leaders have developed an odd and presumptuous habit of demanding that the leader of the opposition resign too. “As a party leader who has accepted when her time was up,” Theresa May told Jeremy Corbyn in her final prime minister’s questions, preparing to leave her party to Boris Johnson and the country without a prayer, “perhaps the time has come for him to do the same.”In 2016, David Cameron – who had called a referendum lost it, only to then break his promise and abandon the country in a moment of self-inflicted crisis – suggested Corbyn’s resignation would be a patriotic act. “It might be in my party’s interest for him to sit there. It’s not in the national interest. I would say, for heaven’s sake, man, go.”Stranger still, many Labour parliamentarians agreed with them: Cameron’s speech took place in the middle of a full-blown, if woefully inept, coup.When the 2017 exit polls on election night suggested that Labour had far exceeded expectations, increasing its vote share and seats while the Tories lost their majority, a BBC documentary showed the muted response of several Labour MPs. They were shocked not into jubilation, but silence they had looked forward to his defeat, removal and “party renewal” even if it meant they had to go down with him. The former leader Tony Blair, meanwhile, put his head in his hands and said he didn’t understand this country any more.The political and media establishments are still struggling with the choice the Labour party made in 2015. The fact that the decision was emphatic, had to be made twice following the failed coup, and was effectively endorsed by the electorate in 2017, has not been enough. On some level, that goes beyond the political to the psychological: they refuse to accept his tenure as legitimate.This sense of denial runs deep – as though insisting he should not be the party leader in effect means he’s not. It is a delusion that recalls the author Doris Lessing’s observation of Blair’s declarative approach to politics: “He believes in magic. That if you say a thing it is true.”Corbyn is the leader of the Labour party. He has a mandate. He represents something other than just himself. That is not a statement of opinion but of fact. One does not have to like it to accept it. But the failure to accept it will have material and strategic consequences. And, with a general election imminent and the future of the country’s relationship with Europe finely balanced, the moment of reckoning with that fact is long overdue. For there is no route to a second referendum without Labour there is no means of defeating Johnson without Labour. The party remains the largest, and by far the most effective, electoral obstacle to most of the immediate crises that progressives wish to prevent. Once again that is not a case for Corbyn or for Labour, but for reality.Earlier this week, when asked which was worse, a no-deal Brexit or Corbyn as prime minister, the Liberal Democrats’ Scotland spokesman, Jamie Stone, said: “It may be that somebody else may emerge from the Labour party. I think the ball is very much in the Labour party’s court to see what alternatives they could find.”That is not going to happen. Liberal Democrats don’t get to choose the Labour leader. Labour does. The Lib Dems have long struggled to understand this. In 2010 Nick Clegg said he could work with Labour, just not Gordon Brown. Two years later they said they could work with Labour but the shadow chancellor Ed Balls must go.The insistence that Labour couldn’t get the numbers in parliament to oust Johnson and make Corbyn a caretaker prime minister is a self-fulfilling prophecy made most ardently by those who won’t give him the numbers. But even if it wasn’t, it is a fallacy to assume that anyone else would get any closer. When pressed on which he would prefer – “Is it Jeremy Corbyn or is it no deal?” – Stone eventually showed his cards. “It is no deal every time.”There is candour in this. It is effectively the position of his party and many others, including a few disgruntled Labour members, for whom a potential Labour government under Corbyn is somehow worse than the actual no-deal Brexit under Johnson that may soon happen. But there is a clear contradiction too. Some of those who have devoted the past few years to stopping any kind of Brexit now claim that the only thing worse than a no-deal Brexit – the worst kind of Brexit they could possibly imagine – is the leader of the only party that can stop a no-deal Brexit.None of this is a reason to necessarily support Labour or Corbyn. There are all sorts of reasons, from antisemitism to an insufficiently pro-European stance, as to why progressives might decide not to back Labour at this moment and the calculations are very different outside England and in those areas where tactical voting offers the best hope of getting rid of Conservatives. And given the redistributive agenda that Labour laid out at last week’s conference, there are all sorts of reasons why progressives might back it, too.Political parties are not entitled to anyone’s support. They must earn it. The moment they start blaming voters for not supporting them, they are sunk. That’s as true for Labour under Corbyn as it was for the US Democrats under nominee Al Gore. But that does not absolve the voter from the strategic and moral responsibility of accounting for their vote.In the second round of the French presidential elections in 2002, which pitted the conservative Jacques Chirac against the far-right candidate Jean-Marie Le Pen, a Communist party local councillor, François Giacalone, voted for the conservative. “When the house is on fire,” he said, “you don’t care too much if the water you put it out with is dirty.”Right now, the house is on fire. Johnson’s first couple of months in office have illustrated that what’s at stake is not a contest between bad and worse. This is a leader who uses the police as props breaks the law to undermine democracy and stokes ision with rhetoric that can and has been easily co-opted by the far right, pitting a section of the population against parliament and the judiciary. Johnson’s cabinet and its agenda, both with regards to Brexit and beyond, do not represent a mere shift to the right but a paradigmatic sea-change in British politics that, where Europe is concerned, may have irreversible consequences.Those who last year were literally on the fringe of the Tory party conference have this week been running the show. The coming election will not just be about opposing Brexit – it’ll be about defending democratic norms. The key consequence of understanding that Corbyn is the legitimate leader of the Labour party is understanding that this fire cannot be extinguished without him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baef1492cfd17c49042da4a3290249ce52c30e8e/902_744_2671_1602/master/2671.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54c0a3972cc9be8b6d372825b29959a9","title":"greater horseshoe bats living in kent after absence of 115 years","story":"Climatic change may be behind expanded range of very rare native mammal of British IslesOne of Britain’s and northern Europe’s rarest and most elusive mammals has been discovered living in the east of England for the first time in 115 years.The return to Kent of the greater horseshoe bat has delighted and astounded conservationists, who are now examining whether climate change is shifting the species’ range. The bat is normally found only in Wales and the west of England.This secretive, buff-coloured, creature (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum) is one of Britain’s biggest bats. It frequently evades and challenges pursuers, fluttering unseen through shadows and hiding underground in caves, tunnels and occasionally buildings.The animal hunts and navigates by screaming out high-frequency echolocation whistles through flaps on its horseshoe-shaped noseleaf, but the calls are beyond the human hearing range. The bat often navigates in silence or changes the shape, width and direction of its sonic beam, along with the intensity of the pulse, which means ecologists searching for it can easily miss it.The creature’s distinctive, alien-like, ultrasonic warbling signals were recorded at two locations near the coast during May and June by two separate teams of bat ecologists.Joe Nunez-Mino, spokesperson for the Bat Conservation Trust, confirmed that the unusual recordings had been verified by national experts. “It is possible that an inidual bat was blown off course or has travelled over from France, or that a bat has dispersed across the UK from strongholds in the west of England or Wales.“It is also possible that the species is now able to expand its range into Kent due to climatic changes. The habitats in the area that the recordings were made are not dissimilar to those in its western strongholds.”No one has yet found the bats’ roost, and it’s not known whether this is a breeding population or how they arrived. These bats do not typically venture beyond a range of about three to 20 miles from a roost, and Britain’s 12 known isolated greater horseshoe colonies and 35 breeding roosts are all much further west.Recent evidence suggests climate change is driving up the numbers of greater horseshoes, bringing more insects in warmer springs, earlier bat births, spring rainfall and better temperatures when the animals emerge from hibernation.The Bat Conservation Trust says good farm and landscape management can mean huge potential for greater horseshoes. They need woodland, a lack of light pollution, pesticide-free grazed pasture with chemical-free dung harbouring dung beetles, as well as moths, cockchafers and flies, plus tall continuous hedgerows that are not trimmed for up to 10 years.

It appears to have been very much a community effort.The fatberg was discovered under The Esplanade in Sidmouth, a few metres from the sea, by South West Water just before Christmas last year and made headlines around the world.In February a hardy bunch of workers donned breathing apparatus to begin the painstaking process of hacking the fatberg into small pieces and removing it from the sewer. It took eight weeks and the monster was carted away in 36 tankers.Campaigns to educate people about how not to feed fatbergs take pains to remind us that toilets and sinks are not “magic portals”. There is a simple set of rules for the bathroom: stick to flushing the three Ps: pee, poo and (toilet) paper. Everything else – sanitary towels, nappies, cotton buds, condoms, dental floss, used plasters and whatever else you might think to chuck down the toilet – should go into the bin.Just because a product says it is flushable doesn’t mean that it is biodegradable. Baby wipes might be a godsend to parents, but not to Victorian-era sewerage systems. Wipes marketed as flushable will probably be able to make their way down your toilet, but will eventually clog up the pipes further along their journey.The kitchen is another area of concern. Water companies are keen to bust the myth that running hot water and pouring washing-up liquid down the sink ahead of fats, oils or grease will stop it building up and blocking the pipes. Their recommendation is to keep a small container, such as an old margarine tub, to hand in your kitchen, into which you can pour oil and fat before safely disposing of it in the bin.A team of scientists from the University of Exeter were given the scarcely less enviable job of carrying out the autopsy to establish how it came into being and whether it posed environmental risks.The scientists were given four 10kg samples from the fatberg, which smelled like a heady combination of rotting meat and an unclean toilet. They melted the chunks and then combed through them by hand before subjecting samples to forensic analysis.The team found that the samples they received were mostly made of animal fats consistent with domestic food preparation combined with household hygiene products such as wet wipes and sanitary products, as well as natural and artificial fibres from toilet tissues and laundry.Crucially, the team found the fatberg contained no detectable levels of toxic chemicals, meaning its presence in the sewer did not pose a chemical or biological risk to the environment or human health.Prof John Love, a synthetic biology expert at the University of Exeter, said: “We worried that the fatberg might concentrate fat-soluble chemicals such as those found in contraceptives, contain now-banned microplastic beads from cosmetics and be rich in potentially pathogenic microbes, but we found no trace of these possible dangers.“We were all rather surprised to find that this Sidmouth fatberg was simply a lump of fat aggregated with wet wipes, sanitary towels and other household products that really should be put in the bin and not down the toilet. The microfibres we did find probably came from toilet tissue and laundry, and the bacteria were those we would normally associate with a sewer.”Scientists from the Greenpeace laboratory, based at the university’s Streatham Campus, also looked at the chemical composition of the fatberg. The results suggested that the fats found were more in keeping with domestic food preparation than commercial food outlets, while the chemicals were those found in personal care products rather than pharmaceuticals or pesticides.Nicky Cunningham, the manager for the Centre for Resilience in Environment, Water and Waste, said: “The results indicate that there isn’t a single contributing factor or demographic responsible for this fatberg coming to being.”South West Water’s director of wastewater, Andrew Roantree, said: “Although we deal with around 8,500 blocked sewers every year, the Sidmouth fatberg was by far the largest discovered in our service history. We wanted to learn as much as we could about it, how it was created and what it was made of to help us avoid further fatbergs in future.“We will be using these results to help us educate, inform and change the behaviours of people in terms of what they are putting down the toilet and sink. That’s not just applicable to Sidmouth but across our region.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7344e94ae3d989ef279211c89edea941edfc1446/0_0_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7af4b769414c05b4b0def3b141cfdffa","title":"giant cookies and 911 the woman who recorded the news 24 hours a day","story":"Marion Stokes built up an archive of 70,000 tapes that range from local news oddities to world-changing events – and make for a compelling narrative of our timesThese days we’re marinated in news all day long – meaning that Marion Stokes was way ahead of her time. For more than 30 years until her death in 2012, the Philadelphia resident recorded the news 24 hours a day. More than 70,000 tapes of footage were amassed, covering everything from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis to the 1986 Challenger shuttle disaster, 911 and the Sandy Hook massacre.Director Matt Wolf has spent the past five years sifting through Stokes’ 70,000 tapes and 50,000 books (not to mention a collection of Macintosh computers). He has pulled together a compelling narrative around her obsessions and the ways in which they affected her life and family. “This is an archive which has anything and everything,” Wolf says. “History takes on greater meaning as time passes and Marion was so invested in knowledge and truth – it’s just that she didn’t know what would have meaning or truth in the future, so she had to record it all.”The result is a film called Recorder: the Marion Stokes Project – curated and spliced footage that veers between local news oddities, such as giant cookie bakes and children stuck in pipes, to events of global interest. It’s all intercut with video of the firebrand Stokes and interviews with her family. “Looking through the footage showed me so clearly how the media shapes our perceptions,” Wolf says, “and this was way before and so much more complex than ‘fake news’. There are a few events where television was at the centre of history-making: man walking on the moon, JFK’s assassination, the Challenger explosion. What’s so visceral is seeing how the media catches fire in real time to these world-changing events and then how we learned it all through television.”Born in 1929 and adopted into a working-class family, Stokes became a committed communist she wanted to relocate her first husband and young son Michael to Cuba in the 1960s. She failed to convince her family and so remained in the US, her activism and reputation for uncompromising debate leading to a late night spot on local television hosting a panel show on the political issues of the day with her soon-to-be second husband John Stokes. She was something of an eccentric local celebrity, only leaving the house to film her show and to have a daily martini at her local bar.“She had been collecting books and newspapers for most of her life,” says her son, Michael Metelits, “but the television thing really took off from the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. That was when she became obsessed with the way stories were reported and how they changed. I was 18 at the time and it struck me as strange, but my mother was strange for her whole life.”Beginning with taping just one channel on the hostage situation, her preoccupation soon expanded into a 24-hour affair across multiple networks. “She would be stationed in the room with one or two TVs going and she’d be recording,” Metelits says. “There were times when tapes needed to be changed and that became a form of controlling the flow of conversation around her. If there was a difficult moment, there would be a pause where she said she needed to change the tape.”Stokes insisted on recording on VHS, resisting going digital or purchasing recording services such as TiVo as she was worried her recordings might be accessed or tracked. The taping soon became an obstructive presence in Stokes’ life – seemingly not for John but for Michael and John’s children. “The bizarre arc of my mother’s life is compelling,” Metelits says, “but it was difficult to live in. It was inspiring that my mother had an encyclopaedic intellect but she would use it in an adversarial fashion and that never made it easy to talk to her. She would see connections between things that no one else would but that could come at the cost of her emotional relationships.”The film carefully skirts the issue around whether Stokes was an eccentric visionary – an archivist of a medium that has come to define our lives – or an obsessive hoarder. “I want the film to generate an emotional experience around ideas,” Wolf says. “I was very adamant that the film not resort to psychological explanations of why Marion does what she does. I didn’t want to pathologise her as a hoarder, since someone can be dysfunctional and insightful, those two things can coexist, and Marion is a very unexpected example of that.”One of the most compelling uses of Stokes’ collection in the film is a four-screen grid of the events of 911 unfolding in real time. One by one, each screen breaks the story, a slow patchwork of shock and meaning combined to leave the viewer with the one, searing image of the plane crashing into the monolith. It is a visual collage which not only bears witness to a key historical event but also reflects the multiple perspectives from which people around the world would have viewed it from.“She was very much ahead of her time,” Metelits says. “She wouldn’t be confused at all by the hall of mirrors we see in the news media and social media today. She believed that what she was doing was something of a tonic a way to inoculate yourself from the chaos.”• Recorder: The Marion Stokes Project is at BFI London film festival on 4 October"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9950326e232b0ec6a5601217171c3fe34df69c/0_360_3534_2120/master/3534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94dfbd95274f1d7e65ddf4c200444ae2","title":"joker the incels the incitement the ending discuss with spoilers","story":"Joaquin Phoenix’s cackling baddie is unleashed today – here’s your chance to talk about whether Todd Phillips is trolling us, or if his film deserves all the Oscars it can get• This article contains nothing but spoilers about JokerFew movies in history have had such an extreme pre-release experience. It is almost unheard of for a mainstream Hollywood studio film to win the Venice film festival’s Golden Lion. And it is unheard of for Venice’s winner, usually an erudite art film, to inspire grotesque hate speech from fans on social media should anyone be the least bit critical.A violent look at “how Batman’s foe got that way,” Joker has been hailed as revolutionary for its depiction of mental illness, but – at least in gun-toting America – screenings have been suggested as a potential trigger of violence. There’s been no shortage of conversation around Todd Phillips and Joaquin Phoenix’s movie but until now, as is so often the case online, few people had actually seen it. Until now. Here are the pressing topics, only some of which are worth laughing about.Todd Phillips, who is as crafty with the press as Mr Terrific is with T-Spheres, has said that he convinced Phoenix to appear in his supervillain origin story by suggesting they would “sneak a real movie in the studio system under the guise of a comic-book film”. This does not sound like someone who is particularly enamoured of the genre. “Let’s make a real movie with a real budget and call it fucking Joker,” he continued. He’s cited movies by Martin Scorsese and (surprisingly) Chantal Akerman as influences. So the question is: is this movie really that different?We’ll give Philips the points here. This is lightyears away from zippy, agreeable fare like, say, Ant-Man and the Wasp or Thor: Ragnarok. Even the so-called “grimdark” superhero movies like Batman v Superman or Watchmen feel like an entirely different genre. While Joaquin Phoenix’s Arthur Fleck does paint his face, and eventually masks do come into play, there are no costumes and certainly no stylised slugfests. This is a dark and (eventually) gruesomely violent drama that is nihilistic and performance-driven. It isn’t about special effects.Comic book enthusiasts will still, however, find a few examples of their beloved DC lore. Arthur Fleck (which is what the Joker is named in this version) pays a visit to Arkham State Hospital, a tweak on the Arkham Asylum from the comics. The more exciting connections come with the Wayne family. For a stretch it is suggested that Thomas Wayne might actually be Arthur’s father. This turns out to be a red herring, but not before Arthur heads up to Wayne Manor and makes contact with the young Bruce Wayne … who playfully slides down a pole at some point. That’s right – an ur-Bat Pole! (Note: this is just about the only moment of levity in the entire picture.)During the big climax, we see, once again, Bruce’s parents get killed. In some of these tellings (notably Tim Burton’s version) culpability is laid at Joker’s feet. The new movie offers a clever twist. As the dispossessed citizens of Gotham City rally around Joker as some sort of political hero, it’s just some random thug in a clown mask who kills the famous zillionaires, not Joker himself. (In a nice spin, they are still outside a theatre showing Zorro, but it’s the dopey 1981 comedy Zorro, the Gay Blade.)Is this movie really just the biggest-budget Ben Shapiro video? To what extent will misogynistic creeps “feel seen” in this film? Well, for most of its run time, it isn’t quite the alt-right manifesto some of the pre-release discourse suggested. It’s really just a drama about a mentally ill man with no friends who is targeted by bullies, lives with his mother, is ignored by the attractive woman down the hall and only finds purpose in mass murder.Wait, I know that sounds like it is sympathy for the incel, but Fleck’s anger, for most of the movie, stays rooted in his own circumstances. He isn’t really railing against PC culture or how he’s owed anything, like a guy who won’t stop talking about Jordan Peterson. It’s more of a generic “My life sucks!” cry than an “Our life sucks, brothers!”In the final reel, though, there is some angry monologuing, and some of those “Nobody cares!” talking points come through, but the writing is too vague and incoherent to really land a point.Heath Ledger won an Oscar posthumously for playing Joker. Jack Nicholson was nominated for a Bafta and a Golden Globe. Does Joaquin Phoenix have a shot at a statuetee? Anything’s possible, I suppose, but if it were up to me, I would say heck no. I like when awards go to best acting not most acting.Phoenix’s mimicry of the pseudobulbar affect (a psychological disorder that causes uncontrollable laughter, coughs, bleats and whimpers) is accurate, at least based on one YouTube video I found. But this is a surface thing. There’s little depth to the character other than, you know, he’s nuts! Time Magazine’s Stephanie Zacharek said it best when she called him “a chicken bone soaked in Coca-Cola”.By now you’ve sussed out that I’m not really a fan of Joker. I mostly found it bleak and juvenile. But it is not without merit. The location photography in Newark, New Jersey and the Bronx captures some real grit. The big finish, while dumb from a story point of view, is marvellously shot. And the big acts of violence are effectively rattling.There’s one moment that shows a true creative spark. Two of Fleck’s old work buddies come to visit him. One (Glenn Fleshler) has long been a jerk, so Fleck, now a killer, stabs him, spraying blood all over the place. The other guy (Leigh Gill), is horrified, but since he was always nice to Fleck, he’s not in danger. Fleck says he can leave and, quaking in terror, Gill heads toward the door. It is, unfortunately, latched from up high and as Gill has dwarfism he can’t reach. It’s absolutely chilling to hear this man ask someone who just butchered a person for help.Part of why this scene works is that it plays to Phillips’s strengths. While it keeps Gill’s dignity intact (he’s one of the few nice people in the film) it’s still a bit of business that finds humour in interaction with dwarfism. For better or worse, that’s the kind of thing Phillips built his career on with bro comedies like The Hangover. It’s sure footing for him, far less so than nihilistic drama.Once Joker has more than a few kills under his belt, he heads into Robert De Niro’s TV studio for his big catharsis. There’s a psych-up scene as he dances outside his apartment, so there’s a pop song needle-drop. Phillips chooses Gary Glitter’s Rock and Roll Part 2. It’s a song you absolutely know, even if the title doesn’t ring a bell. More to the point, especially from a guy recently quoted as saying that “woke culture” has torn him away from comedy, it’s a song recorded by a convicted child sex offender. Todd Phillips really is a troll."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e6dbda59ec8a0da4f6d3b3a32d66d54237c927d/0_214_5358_3215/master/5358.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c1b979ca88be1ded3830fad3cf0e713","title":"martin scorsese says marvel movies are not cinema","story":"The director says he has tried and failed to watch the new brand of superhero films, which he likens to theme parks Martin Scorsese, one of cinema’s most venerated current directors, has decried superhero movies – the dominant force in today’s industry. The director of films such as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas told Empire magazine that his attempts to get up to speed with contemporary superhero films had failed.“I tried, you know?” the director said when asked if he had seen Marvel’s movies. “But that’s not cinema.”He continued: “Honestly, the closest I can think of them, as well made as they are, with actors doing the best they can under the circumstances, is theme parks. It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.”Earlier this year, Avengers: Endgame became the highest grossing film in history after topping $2.8m at the global box office (fifth highest after adjusting for inflation). Eight other titles from the same studio feature in the Top 30 (when factored without inflation). Marvel head Kevin Feige last year defended his films against the kind of criticism levelled by Scorsese, saying that the series’s lack of major awards was no indication of a lack of quality or ambition.Scorsese’s latest film, The Irishman, won rave reviews from its premiere at the New York film festival last weekend, with critics praising the use of “de-ageing” technology.Out today is Joker, Todd Phillip’s revisionist take on the DC villain, which borrows much from the films of Scorsese, notably 1983’s The King of Comedy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbd6aeebc853434a1fd3ab65d45d2498537dc91f/0_237_1320_792/master/1320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c4bd7299b41a69a88527f562df3ee13","title":"allergic to pepper spice substitute kitchen aide","story":"Salt and pepper are stock ingredients, but what can you substitute if someone is allergic to the black stuff?What do you give someone who can’t tolerate pepper, which seems to be an essential ingredient in every recipe I read? Christopher, Kingston, Ontario, USFaced as he is with an intolerance to salt’s inseparable sidekick, Christopher is asking what to do when a recipe lists pepper in its ingredients. Mostly, though, he’s asking why recipes pretty much always do this.Read all those pieces, and you’ll find a common theme: salt and pepper might, for historical reasons, be joined at the culinary hip, but that doesn’t mean they have to be. In Salt Fat Acid Heat, Samin Nosrat explains that salt, as a mineral, serves both chemical and gustatory functions (it tenderises meat, draws water out of vegetables, it insulates and ensures even cooking when used to bake fish, enhances flavour), whereas pepper is just a spice. It is only about flavour. The reason it gets to plays centre court on the dinner table is simply that, of all the spices, it got there first. Using it at this point in time is something of a civilisational habit.So the first step is to realise that you don’t always have to replace it with anything. Or, as chef Asma Khan puts it: “The kick it brings is not always necessary.” Former Bake Off contestant and food writer Chetna Makan agrees: “I’ve got pepper just sitting there. I don’t use much of it. It can easily be skipped in Indian cuisine – it’s not essential.”Of course, you might just love it. For Jeremy Lee, of London’s Quo Vadis, cooking and eating without pepper is nothing less than tragic. But he is quick to point to several replacements – on the spice rack, the condiment shelf and the produce aisle – that can bring a similar punch. In savoury settings, he’d plump for “a dash of Tabasco, mustard or horseradish spread liberally, or a good-quality peppery leaf such as mustard or rocket.” Makan suggests paprika, for its smokiness, and food writer Jennifer Joyce Sichuan pepper (not, in fact, a type of pepper, but the fragrant bud of the prickly ash tree). Everyone I speak to suggests the obvious: a pinch of dried chilli flakes, preferably a mild on,e such as the Turkish pul biber.Now, it’s tempting to think that pasta cacio e pepe, say, would be impossible to make without pepper, given that it’s literally there in the name of the dish, but I’d happily eat a bowlful of cheesy pasta with any one of the substitutes listed above (well, maybe not the horseradish). The point is, given that pepper is just about flavour and not necessity, you are free to raid your pantry and try things out until you find another flavour that works.The same applies to sweet things. Anna Jones pairs black pepper with cherries in a streusel muffin, while the New York Times’ Mark Bittman is famous for a recipe in which he macerates strawberries in balsamic vinegar and black pepper. In both instances, the spice is a highlight, not a default setting, and Lee suggests nutmeg, cinnamon, mace, allspice, even cloves – “a happy thought”, he says. There are so many more spices out there, none of which, Laperruque notes, are all-purpose. Each brings their own unique flavour. Ultimately, being unable to eat pepper is an invitation to free your tastebuds and try stuff out. That is where the magic lies.

All credit to those who run the things, but I wonder if they are actually the best way – or, and perhaps more to the point, the most enjoyable way – to learn about wine.I say this because I’m trying to learn Spanish at the moment, and rather than poring over textbooks and trying to master my tenses, instead I’ve been practising with the help of an app and focusing on trying to make myself understood, while grabbing hold of unfortunate native speakers and subjecting them to my execrable grammar and accent. (Fortunately, it turns out that the Spanish are very nice.)The trick is simply to plough on, and pretty much the same applies to learning about wine, too. Too many people apologise for their lack of wine knowledge, but even if you work in the trade, you’re never going to know everything there is to know about a region such as Bordeaux, for instance. And if you do know a lot about that, it probably means you don’t know a whole lot about Greece, say, or Chile.I’m not saying classes don’t have value – they definitely do if you want to get a wine qualification it’s just that you can, if you wish, take control (to use an unfortunate expression) of your wine education yourself and it can be equally rewarding. Like travelling solo rather than as part of a group.You might want to buy a couple of books, of course. One major go-to reference book that conveniently pulls everything together in one place is the just-published new edition of Jancis Robinson and Hugh Johnson’s magisterial World Atlas of Wine (Mitchell Beazley, £50), now in its eighth incarnation, or Rajat Parr and Jordan Mackay’s The Sommelier’s Atlas of Taste: A Field Guide to the Great Wines of Europe (Ten Speed Press, £30), which explains really well why wines taste as they do.• For more by Fiona Beckett, go to matchingfoodandwine This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Well, keep it to yourselves for a while because it is too early for punchlines and you do not want to advise Leicester to go laughing all the way to the bank just yet. But they are certainly entitled to smile as they prepare for Saturday’s trip to Liverpool, the only team in the league with a plausible claim to have a better back four than Brendan Rodgers’s side.To say that Leicester have looked stronger since the departure of Harry Maguire is not to besmirch the England defender, a deserved high-achiever. Rather it is to celebrate two positives: the impact made at Leicester by his direct successor, Caglar Soyuncu and the fact Soyuncu has stepped into a much more helpful environment than the one that Maguire is trying to make sense of at Old Trafford.That, of course, leads to another point, which is that of the many bad decisions made by Manchester United in recent years, selling Jonny Evans to West Brom for £6m in 2015 was among the worst. Buying the Northern Ireland international from West Brom for £3.5m last year was one of many shrewd ones made by Leicester. A month after that purchase they bought Soyuncu for £19m from Freiburg and now that, too, looks a canny deal. Ricardo Pereira arrived around the same time as Evans and Soyuncu and can now be ranked with Ben Chilwell as one the best full-backs in the Premier League. Leicester have a rearguard to be reckoned with.It was not obvious that things would play out so well. If United had not waited until just before the closure of the transfer window to stump up the money for Maguire, Leicester would probably have signed another centre-back. Instead, rather than rush to buy, they decided to give Soyuncu a chance to prove his worth. He has seized it.During his four league starts last season it was clear he had a lot of potential but also a certain erraticism. After his first match this term – the 0-0 draw with Wolves – he was flawless and returned to the dressing room to be greeted with a standing ovation from his teammates. The other players knew the pressure that the 23-year-old had been under as the world watched to see how Leicester would cope without Maguire. Their applause showed he had earned the players’ confidence and they wanted to give him some back.There has been no trace of impostor syndrome from Soyuncu. On the contrary, the young Turk has defended with admirable assertiveness, commanding in the air and vigilant in his marking and tackling. And his elan on the ball flirts with the outrageous. Rodgers said this season that the player needs to measure his risk-taking but, at the same time, the manager could not help grinning as he referred to the “wee maverick things” that Soyuncu likes to do: highlights from this season include dribbling past Bournemouth’s Callum and Harry Wilson in his own area or dancing around Tanguy Ndombélé in a way that left Tottenham’s record signing sprawled on the grass like a sprinter who trod on a roller skate. Leicester fans have fallen in love.Soyuncu still needs a little refinement, of course. The only game Leicester have lost this season was, ironically, to Manchester United, where Marcus Rashford lured Soyuncu into conceding a penalty. The evidence so far suggests that Rodgers and Evans will help the centre-back to become more accomplished without losing his personality. The Leicester coach Kolo Touré will surely also have good counsel to give on that front.Of course, even before the arrival of Rodgers in February, Leicester was a place where players progressed quickly. Chilwell, at 22, is an exceptionally mature left-back, assured in defence and constantly dangerous going forward. Pereira, too, has quickly proven to be top class. A year ago, right-back was a problem position for Leicester, and Pereira, a £21m recruit from Porto, did not look like the solution. He was so much at sea during a 4-2 defeat at Bournemouth in September 2018 that one could have concluded that if he were to have a future in the Premier League, it would only be as a wing-back or a midfielder. But the Portuguese soon adapted, demonstrated defensive nous to go with his offensive excellence, and ended up being voted Leicester’s player of the season.That vindicated Claude Puel, Rodgers’s predecessor who had worked with Pereira at Nice before bringing him to Leicester. But the style introduced by the former Celtic manager, and the increased fitness he has demanded, are even more suited to Pereira and the rest of Leicester’s young team. The aggressive, co-ordinated pressing – “defending forward”, as Rodgers often calls it – allows the whole team to work in sync and usually on the front foot. That is part what makes them, and Liverpool, so exciting to watch and so formidable to play against.Saturday’s showdown at Anfield promises to be an all-action contest between two creative and devoutly attacking teams, yet each defence is so strong that there may not be many goals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21fdb7edf8bdee608d32f7b2acf9e80aa4cae97f/304_28_2234_1340/master/2234.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21364bc0474a4ef504822d54f99c7e33","title":"premier league team news liverpool v leicester build up and more live","story":"Crystal Palace news: Roy Hodgson has defended his striker Christian Benteke, who looks utterly bereft of confidence, has yet to get off the mark this season and has scored just four times in his past 58 games for Crystal Palace.Responding to comments made by former Palace midfielder John Salako, who claimed Benteke has “been awful” in his time at Selhurst Park, Hodgson went on the offensive.“I am always disappointed when professionals criticise fellow professionals, even if they are ex-professionals,” he said. “I think that you do need to be careful in terms of abusing your profession in a way, by criticising other professionals without properly knowing all the details you would need to know.“We here see Christian trying his level best every week to get back to goalscoring form.

If I am unemployed and I hang about the park, why should somebody accuse me of the crime of hanging around? It is the colonialist that feared that Africans being around that drafted that law. It should be repealed,” he said.Museveni also ordered the release of street vendors and hawkers serving jail sentences for selling clothes, food, trinkets, spices, fruits and household goods on the pavements in the capital, Kampala.“All people that have been arrested on account of this nonsensical crime should be released immediately and all prosecution discontinued because, in any case, the police and courts have got more real crimes that they need to deal with (murder, rape, robbery, embezzlement, etc),” said Museveni in a tweet on Thursday.Patricia, a street vendor on the capital’s Kampala Road welcomed the directive.“We welcome the president’s gesture. This is a big relief for us. As vendors we can’t afford the rent fees for arcades. The police and enforcement officers have been torturing us,” said Patricia, a mother of three.There are more than 10,000 vendors and hawkers in Kampala who have been engaged in running battles with the Kampala City Authority enforcement officers and police over illegal trade in the streets, with some of them arrested, charged and jailed. They face heavy fines and two-month prison sentences.But Museveni’s actions have been challenged. Male Kiwanuka Mabirizi, a Kampala lawyer filed a case at the high court in Kampala this week, challenging the president’s directive as illegal, unreasonable, irrational and procedurally improper.In his lawsuit, Mabirizi isarguing for the civil court to quash the directives and issue a permanent injunction and prohibition of any Ugandan government official or agency from implementing the orders.“The inspector general of police is required to act according to the law. The offence of idle and disorderly is in the Penal Code Act, laws of Uganda,” he said.“The director of public prosecution is independent and cannot take directives from the president.”Frank Baine, Uganda’s prison spokesperson, said the directive will be respected and observed once received by the authorities.However, Mabirizi said the president doesn’t have the powers to direct the release of inmates serving sentences without the advice of the advisory committee.“The president can only exercise his prerogative of mercy upon being advised by the advisory committee on prerogative of mercy,” said Mabirizi.“Uganda prisons admit and release prisoners upon court orders or a duly signed and sealed presidential pardon reached upon the advice of the committee on prerogative of mercy, and not on directives communicated through police,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc61e4d0d4113f2d2584902aa06029e15dd49f2f/0_241_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f964da00b76303844570d6b15c5643b3","title":"the many faces of global hunger in pictures","story":"Lack of proper nutrition affects more than 150 million children worldwide, contributing to 3m deaths each year.

This week, Parkrun celebrated its 15th birthday, with 6 million people – from prisoners to pensioners, buggy-pushers to record-breakers – now signed up to the community event and 4 million having participated.Every week, more than 350,000 people take to their local green space for the free, timed 5km (3.1-mile) Parkrun, expecting to reap the health benefits.After its creation in 2004, the first Parkrun outside the UK was started in Zimbabwe three years later. In April, Japan became the 21st country to host the event, launching a Tokyo parkrun.Meanwhile, Parkrun Russia started with two simultaneous runs in parks in Moscow in March 2014, and there is now an event in Siberia, where organisers have pledged never to let snow, ice or cold weather force them to cancel.In Africa, runners in Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) and South Africa’s vast cities and grasslands are also regulars.The combined distance so far is 162m miles (260m km) at 53.8m Parkruns globally, which adds up to 3,118 years, 25 days, 22 hours, 7 minutes and 18 seconds of running and walking.For many, the event, entirely organised by volunteers within communities, has changed their lives.Dawn Nisbet from Oldham, who recently completed her 70th Parkrun and is a run director for the event, said: “In April 2016, my stepmother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. I was also very overweight, completely inactive except walking my two dogs. Being so unfit and unhealthy, my opinion of myself was low, which limited a lot of my activity and self-confidence, but then a friend suggested Parkrun.“I’d never heard of it before as, quite frankly, it’s not something I would have ever considered as for me. I researched it on the internet and sent an initial email – I think if I’m honest, I was hoping they would say, ‘No, you’re too slow and don’t run the whole 5k, so thanks but no thanks’. But they were wonderful, so welcoming, happy for me to walk the whole thing or whatever suited me.”The NHS assistant director, who has since completed four 10km runs and a half marathon, said she was drawn to the event due to the lack of hierarchy and intensity normally associated with mass participation sporting events.“It’s not about coming first or winning. You can go at your own pace and just enjoy being with other people. It is so inclusive and the perfect way to start your weekend in the outdoors chatting to people. It has completely changed my outlook on life,” said Nisbet.Of the almost 2,000 Parkruns held each week in 21 countries, 25 take place in prisons – 18 in the UK, two in Ireland and five in Australia – where prisoners and staff often complete multiple laps of an exercise yard to reach 5km.Next week, Parkrun will reach another landmark by launching its first prison event in the UK for women only, following the lead of Australia.The fastest recorded time at any Parkrun was set in 2012 in Bushy Park by the British Olympian Andy Baddeley, who finished in 13 minutes and 48 seconds.Charlotte Arter set the best women’s time of 15 minutes and 50 seconds in Cardiff in January. Notable participants include the Olympians Jessica Ennis-Hill and Dame Kelly Holmes.But Parkrun organisers, who are keen to avoid putting people off with competitive comparisons and are delighted for people to walk the course, do not have a record of the slowest time.Sinton-Hewitt said: “One of the things that I’m most proud of is that every year the average finish time at Parkrun has slowed. That means we are reaching more people for whom physical activity hasn’t been the norm.“I would like to see that continue, and for more people to understand that Parkrun is truly welcoming of those who want to walk, jog, run or volunteer, especially those who would like to take their first steps on the path of being physically active.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6bbbc9f89a8774cab39de8150e0d12807b56fc04/0_150_4978_2986/master/4978.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99bb853e29d2c9dbf9e6dea759c43e58","title":"jpegmafia i want to create a space for invisible black people","story":"With militant politics and a mandate to provoke, Jpegmafia is the US Air Force veteran who makes outsider rap to mosh toIt’s a balmy autumn afternoon and Jpegmafia is laughing about the many online, white alt-right men who seem to be triggered by lines such as “Pistol whip ’em, I can’t waste the bullet in a poserIncels gettin’ crossed ’cause I crossed overHow they go from Anne Hathaway to Ann Coulter?”“This shit be breaking niggas,” he says giddily, almost beaming with pride. “They be on Reddit spilling they feelings and shit. They can’t deal with it.”While his flair for riling up online edgelords is a recent discovery, the 29-year-old rapper and producer has been tinkering with his sound for more than a decade. Last year he finally broke through with his album, Veteran, bracing noise-rap with a radical lyrical agenda, rife with references to anime and video games, and jabs at everyone from Donald Trump’s counsellor Kellyanne Conway to the television host and comedian Bill Maher. Now he is about to release the more melodic, but only occasionally less aggro, new album All My Heroes Are Cornballs.It is a left turn that is a stunning expansion of his punk ethos – pushing his anti-establishment rhetoric to the brink, promoting a DIY ingenuity, embracing the counterculture – and yet another provocation.Jpegmafia was born Barrington Hendricks in Brooklyn, New York. In his song Williamsburg, Jpeg reprimands the gentrifiers taking over the borough: “We taking Brooklyn backYou can leave the coffee,” he snarls. The irony of the fact that we are chatting in a coworking space in the Brooklyn area of Williamsburg called the Brass Factory, which has been converted from a real brass factory, is not lost on the rapper. His career has been about embracing contradictions, making noise music pushing a militant agenda of black self-defence to confused white audiences – radical rap to mosh to. Jpeg has been accused of being a troll or provocateur, but his rage raps are unambiguous about where his fury is from and where it is aimed.“If you listen to my music, you know who I’m talking to, what I’m talking about, and exactly what my message is,” he says, wearing his signature black and red bandanna, combat boots and a T-shirt splicing the Gucci logo with the Rainbow Fish children’s book character.“The only people who misinterpret it is goofy white niggas. People attach words like ‘edgy’ and shit like that to me. It’s like yo, when has it ever been edgy for a black person to talk about black issues? Just because I’m not doing it the way Common is, where I’m like, ‘Hug your mom’ and shit.” He pauses briefly, then smirks. “But also goofy white niggas come to my shows, so.”To escape, he enlisted in the military at 18. He served one term in the US Air Force, during which he was deployed to Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, North Africa and Japan. He says being poor and black is all that prompted him to join up. “A recruiter came to school and I was like, ‘I have no other option, I can either die here or ... at least this will get me out of my situation,’” he says. “I’m not some patriot. I didn’t have some yearning to defend my country or anything. I was poor. And I was taken advantage of, really.”He remembers his time overseas as “extremely scary” and the military as a club of dick-swinging jocks. A reluctant black soldier caught between the service arm of white American nationalism and its hatred of the Middle East, he describes serving abroad as “being swept up in some shit you didn’t start”. The military was isolating. “When they write their rules, they don’t think about black people, so it’s not meant for black people.”He would never recommend it, but the air force reinforced his tireless work ethic. He had a computer and made beats in tiny spaces under the immense stress of intermittent combat. Deployed during the filesharing era, Jpeg had access to an endless cache of digital music but barely enough broadband speed to process much of it. He would spend whole weekends listening to anything he had managed to download: Kanye’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Wiz Khalifa’s Kush \u0026amp Orange Juice, Rick Ross’s Teflon Don Ariel Pink, country music. With an eclectic and voracious musical appetite, he started releasing music as Devon Hendryx in 2011. After a string of unsuccessful rap mixtapes, he turned to making lo-fi “freak folk” as Ghost Pop. “That’s the most unconfident album I ever made,” he says. “It’s all depressed and suicidal. That’s the last time I think I ever drop my guard on record.”He cut his teeth doing live shows at small house parties in Japan. What little buzz the band garnered locally made him feel validated in his decision to pursue music.Hendricks changed his name to Jpegmafia, moved to Baltimore and was there during a series of riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man who fell into a coma while he was being transported in a police van. “It was a ghost town. Shit was on fire. Cops were acting crazy. It felt like war.” The turmoil inspired his 2015 EP Darkskin Manson, with venomous songs such as Cops Are The Target and I Wipe My Ass With Confederate Flags. Jpegmafia’s music began to resonate on the Baltimore scene, leading to the raving punk rap of Veteran. It only took him half his life but he is finally a professional rapper. “The reason I’m 29 and people are just now hearing about me is because there’s no bullshit,” he says. “I don’t have a manager who’s secretly on Interscope. I’m the complete opposite of an industry plant. I’ve been doing this since I was 15 years old and nobody cared till I was 28. If I was a different person, I’d be bitter, to be honest.”He brings up Nick Drake, the singer-songwriter who died aged 26 in 1974. “He died alone and a nobody. It wasn’t until 20 years later that people got it. Now there’s whole artists that sound like him, that have careers based off of his style. And he’ll never know because people couldn’t catch on fast enough.”Fortunately for Jpeg, people caught on to Veteran and now, living in Los Angeles, the rapper is dealing with fame. The subtext of All My Heroes Are Cornballs is that every celebrity is human and will inevitably let you down. “It’s kind of like a baseline. Like, let’s get this out the way: All your heroes are fucking cornballs. Don’t put so much faith in these niggas you don’t know.”He cites his own idol, Kanye West – who produced the Common song that inspired him aged 12 – but is reluctant to judge his pro-Trump pronouncements, warning that he may also, much to his chagrin, end up saying stupid things when he is 40. His message is not to put people on pedestals at all.He has a note on his phone with random thoughts and songs that helped inspire the record’s energy, including the phrase “kill all snitches”, Smile by the Beach Boys, TLC’s FanMail, Everything But the Girl, Björk and, of course, Cam’ron. He denies there’s any sort of theme, but says the record is introspective. “I took that antagonistic figure I pointed at people and pointed it at myself instead,” he says.“I wanted it to be more like centred around myself, so that if this is the introduction people are getting, I’m giving them the most honest thing right off the bat. So we ain’t gotta sign a prenup afterwards. You know what you’re getting into.”Jpeg knows what it is like to be an outsider – in the deep south, in the military, as a rap oddity – and he knows what it is like to be justifiably angry. He wants his music and his shows to be outlets for those emotions. “Black people got shit to actually be mad about,” he points out. “A lot of these dudes in metal, they’re just mad at the world because, like … who even knows? But I want to create a space for these invisible black people – where niggas who have genuine shit to be mad about can come and be actually mad about it. I just want it to be communal: we’re all here and we’re all weird and we’re all, like, fucked up and depressed. Let’s, like, fucking rage, yo!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c3b140df5f7bb5324b24a7e2c147abbe596538b/0_797_2628_1575/master/2628.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1edd828a4d500f186fb37baa644cacb4","title":"kim gordon theres a wall of faceless men i have to climb over","story":"She’s the art-rock legend who made Sonic Youth punk – and now, at 66, she has made her first solo record. She drives our writer through LA to talk Donald Trump, existential angst and her anthem called Air BnBBefore she came to typify deadpan Downtown New York cool, Kim Gordon was a teenager in 1970s Los Angeles, smoking pot and listening to Joni Mitchell. It was the pot that landed her in “Disney jail”. Gordon and her friend were in a cave on pirate-themed Tom Sawyer’s Island, lighting up a joint, when the Disney cops swooped in.“They took us underground,” Gordon recalls – to a netherworld where she saw “Mickey Mouse with a walkie-talkie” and endured creepy comments from the officers: “Does your mother know you’re not wearing a bra?”Gordon was left in a juvenile holding cell overnight. She was taking a political science class at the time, and her mind whirled. “I was writing this paper in my head about Disneyland and how fascist it was,” Gordon tells me. “It confirmed my beliefs about American consumerism.” It’s a belief she still holds. “Consumerism is killing us,” she says today.Kim Gordon v Disney is an unusually revealing punk-rock folk tale: from the earliest days of Sonic Youth, the band she co-founded with her ex-husband Thurston Moore, Gordon’s music, art criticism and paintings have been a kind of post-Warhol skewering of American myths. That sceptical eye extends to her first solo album, No Home Record – a bold mix of industrial noise, art-punk poetics and wry wit, which I’m discussing with Gordon at her sunny home in the quiet hills of LA’s Los Feliz district.On display is a signed copy of Neil Young and Crazy Horse’s Zuma a poster for Jean-Luc Godard’s Made in USA and another of Darby Crash of the Germs, who are Gordon’s favourite LA punk band because of their tendency to “deconstruct” on stage unexpectedly. “That’s my kind of entertainment.” Books cover the coffee table: Claire Denis by Judith Mayne Black Is a Color by Elvan Zabunyan Fascination by Kevin Killian. “I used to feel this existential nausea here,” Gordon says of LA. “Now it’s a sigh of relief.”Before Sonic Youth, Gordon helmed a situationist-style project focused on domestic interiors called Design Office. And once, in 2013, I watched her and the German artist Jutta Koether do a “one-act play” in which they read a 1991 magazine Q\u0026ampA between Gordon and the artist Mike Kelley. If a home can be conceptual art, or reciting an interview, an interview in her home could be doubly so.On bass and guitar, Gordon was always what made Sonic Youth punk: the inspired reach of her speak-sung vocals, her declaration that “women make natural anarchists”, her decades-long suggestion that things you wouldn’t expect can be art. She approached the mainstream with the irreverence of the underground and, in her abstracted way, tackled grim social realities, writing songs about Karen Carpenter and body image, media misogyny and sexual harassment at Sonic Youth’s record label.Gordon has long regarded herself more as a visual artist than a musician. “Playing bass was never my desire,” she says. “It was a byproduct of wanting to make something exciting.” At first, Sonic Youth were influenced by the brash extremities of the no-wave scene: “It was like a gauntlet was thrown down,” Gordon says. “‘Here, you try to make something.’” But in the male-dominated New York noise milieu, it was Gordon who made it seem as if anyone could pick that gauntlet up – that to be an artist you just have to begin. Her career has been an inspired testament to her own maxim that at concerts “people pay to see others believe in themselves”.Gordon and Moore’s orce spelled the end of Sonic Youth. Her raw 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, aired the details of his infidelity and their difficult orce. “When I first found out Thurston had a double life, seeing the texts, I was about to go to yoga,” she tells me. “I was just looking at the time when I picked up his phone.” Gordon still went to yoga.She has since experienced a personal renaissance of sorts, joining 303 Gallery as an outlet for her visual art and formed the immersive improv duo BodyHead with Bill Nace. She is co-editing a book of writing about women in music and has been consulting for the television show Daisy Jones and the Six, based on the bestselling novel about a fictional 70s band a la Fleetwood Mac. “I think they want to make it darker,” she says, “or that useless word, ‘authentic’.”Gordon has lived in Los Feliz for three years, having moved from Massachusetts, where she and Moore raised their daughter, Coco, now 25. (Gordon later gives me one of Coco’s poetry zines, which includes a beautiful piece dedicated to her mother: “There’s a Crack in the Carpet – There’s a Dream in My Chest.”) Warm though still a bit elusive, at 66, Gordon says she is still not totally comfortable giving interviews to promote her work and talking about herself: “After a while, you feel like an imposter.” One of her paintings comes to mind: the dripping words Secret Abuse, Gordon’s comment on artists’ relationship to the commercial world. It reminds me of artists’ relationships to themselves, too, and she agrees: “The process is torture.”For her solo album, Gordon worked with an outside producer for the first time, Justin Raisen, an eccentric, new-age-y Angeleno who says he made a habit of regularly chanting Gordon’s name in the weeks before the universe conspired to bring them together: he DM’d her after his brother met her at a restaurant. Gordon felt that Raisen – who has worked with Sky Ferreira and Angel Olsen – understood her “trashy, dissonant” sensibility. “It was pretty casual,” she says. “Justin just said: ‘Bring over your fucked-up poetry and we’ll make some shit.’ He was calling me Kimye.”Named after No Home Movie, a film by Chantal Akerman, No Home Record powerfully makes the case for Gordon as an art concept herself, one who combusts notions of what music can be in order to obliquely expose the status quo. Her music feels more aligned with her visual art practice than ever – the lyrics of the vertigo-inducing Murdered Out mention matte-black spray. In her art and her music, her language is striking. She has recently painted hashtags – #Resist, #PussyGrabsBack, #YouDontOwnMe – and on No Home Record there is an abrasive anthem called Air BnB.“It’s just subject matter,” she deflects, before adding: “What is the modern-day landscape? What is a portrait now? I’m fascinated by the pictures on Airbnb, these little utopias you can try on, to escape from one’s objects and life.” She mentions the influence of Courbet and Manet, art depicting life happening. “The most interesting art to me is always kind of a critique of the culture,” she says. “Technology gives us a false sense of confidence that everything is always evolving.”When composing the lyrics for No Home Record, Gordon’s friend, the poet Elaine Kahn, prompted her to write down words from her everyday life. She often snatched phrases while driving around LA, looking at the signs in shopping malls. The title of the thundering closing track Get Yr Life Back was a phrase from a plastic sidewalk sandwich board promoting Get Your Life Back Yoga. “Everything is branded now: Get Your Life Back, Be Here Now, these slogans,” she says. In the album’s skittering opener, Sketch Artist, the lyric “dreaming in a tent” refers to LA’s homeless population. I ask if she is collaging reality. “A little,” she says, “or curating.” She suggests we drive around.Gordon grew up on the other side of the city, 45 minutes away, near the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where her father was a sociology professor. Her parents grew up during the great depression Gordon says they never bought into consumer culture. She attended a laboratory school at UCLA that focused on learning-by-doing, which, Gordon says, “really affected the process of how I make things”.“When I learned how to draw, I couldn’t do it,” she recalls, “I would get stuck if I just thought of the pencil on the paper. So I thought of designing the page in lights and darks. You can get so paralysed in art making. I pretend I’m doing something else.”She drives us through MacArthur Park, past Otis College of Art and Design, where she studied in the mid-70s. Other landmarks along the way include a taco stand and her favourite carwash. “Does that say Barbie Spa?” she asks at one point.The songs on No Home Record are also about the consequences of convenience, the breakdown of communication in relationships and the breakdown of the world. The slinking Paprika Pony features a “modern-day Adam and Eve, but they are on their cellphones”. Hungry Baby is about sexual harassment – a subject Gordon broached in 1992 with Sonic Youth’s Swimsuit Issue (Youth Against Fascism, from the same year, also feels upsettingly relevant again). “It was the tip of the iceberg,” Gordon says. I ask if she ever had to fight for her ideas. “There’s some unseen wall of faceless men that I have to climb over,” she says, “as if on a mission.”When Gordon opens Get Yr Life Back with a statement about “the end of capitalism”, she means that the system does not work: “Trump is the ultimate capitalist, destroying everything,” she says. Her wrenching conclusion – “I feel bad for you  I feel bad for me” – is both personal and political. “People advocate forgiveness, which is a good thing, but the reality is different,” Gordon says. “You have to look out for yourself. Even the Dalai Lama says: you can be empathetic, but you don’t have to forgive someone.”In the car, I suggest that perhaps the spaciousness of the LA landscape relates to Gordon’s use of space and rhythm in her vocal phrasings The Sprawl, as Sonic Youth called it. She tells me that she recently listened to an audio version of Joan Didion’s 1970 novel Play it As it Lays while driving around – the tale of an anguishing woman traversing LA’s freeways alone. “Bleak on bleak,” Gordon laughs. “It really did capture that sense of driving around LA if you weren’t trying to get somewhere, but were doing a drift. And how isolating it can feel in the city.”That classic LA isolation is something she still experiences. “I definitely have moments where I feel, not lonely, but the fear of being alone for ever,” she says – articulating each word, slowly, with space. She’ll listen to music to cope – the Steve Gunn-Truscinski Duo records, lately, and Kurt Vile – which “creates its own environment”, or she’ll do something physical, such as weightlifting.Gordon says that No Home Record’s Earthquake is, in part, about that audience-performer relationship, and I ask if she still feels the way she did, decades ago, when she wrote, “The most heightened state of being female is watching people watch you.”“If people are listening, you can feel this intense concentration, and it builds a level of trust,” she says. “I can be vulnerable in a way that I otherwise wouldn’t be able to be if I was just talking. There’s something about music and electricity and the free-flowing, less-contained aspect – it’s like being in the ocean. What’s the inside and what’s outside?”After our MacArthur Park cruise, I wonder how it feels for her to be at another beginning. “There’s a sense that we work, and then we arrive somewhere, and that’s true – because if you work on something for most of your life, when you get into your 50s, you build momentum, and in a way it steamrolls,” Gordon says weeks later, by phone from the south of France, where she has an art show. “But maybe the Buddhism I read as a teenager rubbed off on me – I also like the idea of just always becoming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c275ede9dca6e54350239811aa2761c93e1c4023/0_0_6537_3922/master/6537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0aee42e8ee5120c99caea0a71d4df2a8","title":"reality tv social media and living your life online with jia tolentino","story":"Jia Tolentino, described as one of the world’s greatest young essayists, discusses how the age of the internet has fundamentally changed who we are.

The main hall was an energy-free zone where speaker after speaker appeared to have been given instructions to be as mediocre as possible. The audience couldn’t even get animated when Priti Patel promised to crack down on criminals, something that is usually guaranteed to get members stamping their feet. Then again, with one Tory MP, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, being slung out of the conference centre by police after holding a one-man siege of the international lounge moments before the home secretary’s speech, Boris Johnson facing an inquiry into alleged misuse of public funds during his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri, the government having been found to have acted unlawfully in regard to the recent prorogation and ministers actively working on ways to avoid complying with the Benn act, the Tories had to be careful about who they wanted to clamp down on. Outside the hall, the exhibition was most notable for a stand selling tinned fish – ideal for stockpiling – and one promoting the Cayman Islands as a holiday destination. Come for the tax avoidance, stay for the turtles. With almost no backbench MPs present – only lobbyists and the odd diehard member bother to turn up – the main goal of ministers was to get through the four days without putting their foot in it by letting on that they didn’t have a clue what the Brexit plan was or saying the wrong thing. Not all managed it. Having already had his headline announcement of 40 new hospitals knocked back to six partial refurbs, Matt Hancock, who never knowingly commits himself to a position that can’t be reversed, made the schoolboy error of saying he believed Charlotte Edwardes, the journalist who made the groping allegations against the prime minister. The health secretary looked desperate for days after. Still, the conference turned a tidy profit for the Tories, so job done with an election looming.One bonus of being in Manchester for the Tory conference that I hadn’t anticipated was missing Spurs’ Champions League tie against Bayern Munich. Before the game, I had been gutted to have had to sell my ticket. After, not so much, though there has been a lot of disinformation about the result in the media. The 7-2 defeat wasn’t Tottenham’s worst result at home in Europe. That came in 1995 when we lost 8-0 to Cologne in the Intertoto Cup. Admittedly, we were then actively trying to get knocked out of the competition by fielding a team of 13-year-olds, but one must be accurate about these things and, under the circumstances, a five-goal thrashing was almost respectable. I later spoke to the friend who had gone to the game in my place and he was completely shellshocked. He described it as watching Bayern scoring the same goal over and over again while the Spurs defence just looked on. We’ve all seen games where Spurs are completely clueless and are incapable of making even the simplest pass, but this was the first time he had seen the team actually just give up. I had been hoping for so much more after Tottenham’s gutsy 2-1 win the previous week, in which they had come back from having a player sent off for two yellow cards in three minutes – so brainlessly Spurs – and the goalkeeper letting the ball trickle through his legs for the Southampton goal. Not that you would have known Spurs had been fighting a rearguard action from the highlights shown on the big screen at half-time. From watching those, you would have imagined Spurs were 2-0 up, had 11 men on the field and were in cruise control. It was revisionism worthy of a party conference. Next home game, I’m fully expecting to find Tottenham actually beat Bayern 2-0.It’s almost as if the governing body of world athletics has a death wish. I’m sure all the right people got the relevant money, but holding the World Championships in 40-degree heat in Doha has been a miserable experience for athletes and TV viewers alike. Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson should have been celebrating their gold medals in front of 60,000 people rather than a near-empty stadium where the media outnumbered the spectators. I could swear there were more people watching when my children used to compete in under-15 events for Herne Hill Harriers in south London. However, I couldn’t help but be impressed by Asher-Smith’s mother bribing her with Chanel handbags and computer games to persevere with athletics as a teenager. It put my efforts to shame. In a parallel world, I would have been another Steve Ovett – never Seb Coe, I was probably one of the few Britons willing him not to win – but lack of talent and a large quantity of drugs rather put paid to that dream. I did take up running more seriously in my 30s, taking part in 5k and 10k races, but by then it was all too late. So I was determined my kids were going to live the life I missed out on and forced them down to Tooting Bec athletics track every Tuesday and Thursday evening for training and to competitions at the weekend. This went on for several years, but was an unmitigated disaster even though they were both quite good. Both children hated it and Anna was the only athlete I knew who would invariably declare she had injured herself in the warm-ups.There are days when the only reasonable explanation for the behaviour of some MPs is that they have taken large quantities of hallucinogens to see what fantasy they can believe in now. This was one such day. In the House of Commons, Boris Johnson was presenting his new alternative to the Northern Ireland backstop – two borders rather than one, customs checks carried out by badgers in night-vision goggles, a de facto veto of any arrangement by the Democratic Unionist party and a system that guarantees all sides in Northern Ireland row about its future every four years, because that’s always worked out so well in the past – and Tory MPs were queueing up to award the prime minister a Nobel peace prize for his ingenuity. Though not quite all Tory MPs. Theresa May sat there impassive for the best part of an hour, her face a mixture of despair and disgust. Johnson’s plan was pretty much the alternative arrangements of the Brady amendment she had never bothered to present to the EU as they self-evidently failed to respect both the Good Friday agreement and the need for no customs checks. Predictably, everywhere outside the confines of the Conservative party, newly reunited with its European Research Group paramilitary wing, the DUP and a handful of Labour MPs desperate to vote for a deal – even a worse one than that which they had previously rejected – Johnson’s new proposal was politely, and not so politely, dismissed. We’ve reached the point where the only deal acceptable to the government and for which there is a majority in parliament is one that is dead on arrival.Connor Spear, a 19-year-old with the nickname “Fun-time Frankie”, mislaid his car for a week, having forgotten where he parked it before a weekend festival in Bristol. He was only reunited with the vehicle after a man phoned to say he had been cycling past the car every day. I regret to say that my wife and I can rather improve on that. And we can’t even claim alcohol as an excuse. Several years ago, having not used the car for some days, I couldn’t remember where we had parked it. Having looked in all the normal places outside the front door, I did a search of the neighbouring streets. No joy. So I could only conclude it had been stolen, though why anyone would have wanted to nick a tatty 15-year-old Toyota Yaris rather escaped me. But I nonetheless reported the car stolen to the police and the insurance company and left it at that. Six weeks later, days before we were due to collect our £450 insurance payout, I got a phone call from the police. The car had been found just outside the local Budgens about half a mile from our house. My wife and I crept up the road to investigate and were horrified to discover there were no signs of the Yaris having been broken into or dumped. We could only conclude we must have stopped off at Budgens on the way home from somewhere, forgotten we had come by car after we had done our shopping, and walked home. Since then, we must both have walked past the car countless times without noticing. My subsequent phone call to the insurance company was one of the more embarrassing I have ever made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e312e8eb438512ef18c47ee84f7b48cd81ebaead/0_192_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812751324d232debf4de5d7e2eeda1b7","title":"stormont party veto could be ditched for brexit says minister","story":"The right of one party to veto Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland may be eliminated for the purpose of the UK’s departure from the EU, the Northern Ireland secretary has suggested.Asked if he thought reform of the veto mechanism in Stormont, known as the “petition of concern” could address concerns over the Brexit deal, Julian Smith said: “That could be helpful.”Concerns have been raised by the Irish taoiseach and a number of parties in Northern Ireland that the mechanism could effectively hand the Democratic Unionist party a veto on post-Brexit arrangements.Boris Johnson’s proposals for Brexit centre on a Northern Ireland-only backstop arrangement, under which the country would stay aligned to the EU’s single market, but not its customs union, for five years.However as part of the proposal, the Northern Ireland assembly would have to consent to the arrangement for the 14-month transition period that would follow Brexit on 31 October, and every four years thereafter. “If consent is not secured, the arrangements will lapse,” the proposal says.The Irish government has said it cannot support a proposal that would allow any one party in Northern Ireland to make decisions for the majority.Some were also unclear as to who would give consent for regulatory alignment with the EU if power-sharing was not restored six months before the end of the transition period.There were some concerns that the default would be to return the power to Westminster as part of a direct rule arrangement, undermining the claim that the “Stormont lock” was a fundamental part of the proposal.Smith suggested this was not the intention. “I am not going to go into the detail of the negotiation with the EU, but the Good Friday agreement is very clear on consent – it means one party not dominating.“But I think there are many ways of actually achieving it, and I think we have to really ensure that the parties keep talking and we get them back in the room, that we get them back into Stormont.“And how that resolves itself in terms of Brexit, I think, will be a matter for the coming weeks for the negotiation team.”The government has released a seven-page explanatory note on its Brexit proposals but is facing calls to publish the full 44-page submission to Brussels to allow a wider assessment of the details.Smith was speaking prior to talks on Friday with some of the parties in Northern Ireland amid renewed hopes that a looming 21 October deadline for social reforms on abortion and same-sex marriage laws would be met.When asked by the BBC Question Time presenter, Fiona Bruce, on Thursday night about what would would happen if the devolved government was not restored in time for the Brexit decision, the business minister Nadhim Zahawi ducked the question.“If they are not sitting in the next six months ... then what will happen by then we’ll have entered the negotiation for free-trade deals ... and Northern Ireland will be part of the UK in the overall free trade agreement,” he said.Even if all parties were able to agree on a voting mechanism, separate concerns have been raised that a vote on Brexit arrangements every four years would be destabilising.The Ulster Unionist party leader, Robin Swann, said it would only lead to more uncertainty.“It will make every day Brexit Day in Northern Ireland, the assembly would tear itself apart,” he said.Decisions in the Northern Ireland assembly are normally taken by simple majority, but a petition of concern was introduced after the Good Friday agreement to prevent nationalists or unionists making decisions that could be harmful for either community."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9b5ac300f9fadec2a33f9c1e87be04648976813/0_72_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e377d522f87b730b9a5c0906e6da93ed","title":"tell us if you have applied for welfare and benefit payments online","story":"We would like to hear about any difficulties you have experienced negotiating computer and IT systems while making a welfare or benefit claimPublic authorities are using robots, algorithms and machine learning to assess welfare and benefit claims, but the systems are often hidden inside a ‘black box’, away from public scrutiny.

Four years of planning essentially rest on the next four weeks, unless the whole starship implodes inside the next fortnight. Can they boldly go where only the boys of 2003 have been before? The final frontier will be tantalisingly out of reach until at least 2023 unless Eddie Jones’ mission proves successful.It is ever thus at World Cups, where what goes up can easily plummet back to earth inside 80 minutes. England, if they are anywhere near as good as they aspire to be, really should top Pool C and be confident of defeating Australia, their most likely quarter-final opponents at this stage, in Oita on 19 October. Fail to raise their level when it matters and the feelgood factor that has slowly been building in Japan will have been just another mirage.This black and white outlook is a consequence of Jones having long ago erased any shades of grey. Either the fierce training sessions, the dictatorial approach and the abrupt hiring and firing of key personnel have all been triumphantly worth it or history will view Jones’s slash-and-burn regime unfavourably. There is no real middle ground. By the head coach’s own admission, too, he has never seen it as his role either to nurture the next generation or play the Twickenham political game.So forget about slow, incremental progress: how much higher can he drive the senior team over the next month? Even if Argentina, on Saturday, sneak a first win in this fixture for a decade, a red rose victory over France next Saturday would still see them safely into the last eight. But would you confidently stick your mortgage on any team winning five top-level World Cup games on the spin from now, including potentially against New Zealand, when they have not won either of the past two Six Nations titles nor beaten the All Blacks anywhere since 2012? For England to come good now, therefore, will take a giant leap of some description. They are a good side but not, as yet, a consistently great one.Even Jones cannot be entirely sure if this significant status upgrade is pending. “It’s a bit like a teabag, isn’t it? You don’t know how good it is until you put it in the hot water.” It was a questionable analogy in some respects – full of holes and disposable is not how usually how top teams wish to be perceived – but the general thrust was accurate. Over the years there have been plenty of examples of England teams training brilliantly during the week only to fail to rise to the boil at the weekend.It is not a question of trying to dazzle in the manner of New Zealand, so quicksilver behind the scrum in Japan so far. Equally, though, England cannot rely solely on blunt power and their admittedly impressive fitness. Chugging along, keeping things tight and hoping for the best is not going to be enough, as Ireland are starting to discover. The incidence of sides trailing at half-time before going on to win games has also been low, although Australia against Fiji and Japan versus the Irish were gripping exceptions. Fitness is a vital prerequisite but so is first-quarter dynamism and attacking precision of the sort Wales displayed against the Wallabies.Defensively, too, England were not tested in all areas by Tonga and the United States. Take Elliot Daly. He remains a gifted runner whose pace, useful left boot and ability to give and take a pass – he was a very useful cricketer in his teens – have long since earned Jones’s trust. At some stage, though, a proper aerial examination is surely coming his way. Every full-back in the tournament will currently testify that standing beneath a high ball made slippery by the sweat of others is a desperately precarious business. As the stakes increase it will become harder still.England also need others to step up. There is a theory that Billy Vunipola plays better when his brother Mako is on the field, as is now again the case. Either way, this is the moment to show he really can be considered among the best No 8s in the world, more destructive than Duane Vermeulen, as smart as Kieran Read. Can the popular Jamie George show himself to be as dynamic a presence as, say, South Africa’s Malcolm Marx or be as much of an emotional touchstone as Wales’s Ken Owens? Would Ben Youngs have finished the interception try Gareth Davies scored against the Wallabies and how will he fare if England’s forwards are not on the front foot?Questions, questions. There are certainly more hanging in the air than at the equivalent stage in 2003 when pretty much every component of England’s team had been stress-tested multiple times in advance. Comparisons across generations are invidious but perhaps only three or four of the current squad – Maro Itoje, Mako Vunipola, Manu Tuilagi and possibly Owen Farrell – would, at this stage, definitely make a composite XV. It brings to mind the old joke: Jonny May might just fancy beating Jason Robinson over 30 metres but the latter is now 45 years old.In fairness to all, the game has changed massively and even some of the 2003 gladiators would be taken aback by the conditioning levels of the current crop. But if England are to lift the Webb Ellis Cup they will need the modern-day equivalent of Robinson’s genius, Martin Johnson’s over-my-dead-body defiance and Jonny Wilkinson’s pressure management. When they have been at their best under Jones – not least against Ireland in Dublin in February and again at Twickenham in August – they have generally got out ahead early. In tighter games their game management has so far been less secure.For that reason, with the big prize in mind, they could do with at least one tight pool contest – France are their final opponents – to toughen them up for, potentially, the even bigger challenges to come. As New Zealand have historically discovered, sides who breeze into the last eight are sometimes more susceptible to a physical ambush. Expect England to prosper against Argentina and France but there is still a way to go if they want to rule the world.

It showed how one result can radically transform opinion and expectation, and the New Zealand flanker Sam Cane carefully fielded it by saying: “It will be exciting to see how they go against Scotland.”Japan have to overcome Samoa first in Toyota on Saturday and a danger after their thrilling if, to the outside rugby world at least, unexpected victory over Ireland is that attention not openly leap-frogs to the game against Scotland at Yokohama a week on Sunday, which closes the group stage, but regards the quarter-finals as beneath the summit for the home side.On Monday a local television news channel was casting for overseas journalists to answer a number of questions, one of which was whether Japan can make the final. The victory over Ireland lit up the tournament, igniting imagination and idealism and sending temperatures higher than they are in the various locations where the tournament is being played.Japan are on a World Cup roll, winning their last four matches in the tournament, and five out of six, having succeeded once in their first 24 attempts, against Zimbabwe in 1991. Their run started against Samoa in Milton Keynes almost four years to the day, but just three of the side that started that day will take the field this time.They include the flanker Michael Leitch, the team captain who will not be in charge this time as Pieter Labuschagne, who was given the role against Ireland, remains in the job. It was the introduction of Leitch on the half-hour that helped turn a match Ireland had been in control of, his clear-headedness and direct running helping soothe excitability into composure.Japan’s stark improvement in the past two World Cups has been a direct result of their being awarded this one. It gave them access to the championship countries in both hemispheres: the Brave Blossoms played all 10 between 2016 and last month, unprecedented for an emerging nation, and for the past four years had a presence in Super Rugby through the Sunwolves. A Japan team that in past tournaments conceded 145 points to New Zealand, 91 to Australia and 72 to Wales is now equipped to cope.Leitch, the captain in 2015, is the face of the team in advertisements and posters here. Before the tournament, he was asked about Japan’s goal and his answer was revealing. “I think you need to be very brave in what you say,” he said. “We want to make the quarter-finals, but ideally we want to win the World Cup. That is an outrageous statement but it changes your whole behaviour. We are going to have to try to win it and see how far we get.”Japan had prepared for Ireland for more than a year, targeting the fixture when many thought Scotland – and finishing second in the group – would be their priority. “It is all about being mentally prepared,” he added this week. “We have to think that we are starting at zero after last week and just think about Samoa. They lost their last game and will be playing with pride. We need to steel ourselves and have an even better mentality.”In one sense, it will be a more significant match than Ireland. It will show how Japan are able to cope with the hype that has blown up around them and their opponents, who lost 34-0 to Scotland on Monday, know one more defeat will send them home. “Japan are in our way, just another team we have to beat to get to where we want to be,” said their Bristol back-rower Chris Vui. “We are hugely motivated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b38d823d0f0f18b8e09b616f993c60b15dfb2b46/0_49_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18cf04fc4dad4d2425989c2295316cfc","title":"south africa italy rugby world cup match report","story":"South Africa ramped up the physicality to crush an Italy side reduced to 14 men for most of the second half, moving above the Italians and New Zealand to the top of Pool B.The Springboks have never failed to reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup and they all but erased that possibility at this tournament with a display of controlled brutality at Shizuoka Stadium. The ever-dangerous Cheslin Kolbe scored a try in each half and Bongi Mbonambi, Lukhanyo Am, Makazole Mapimpi, RG Snyman and Malcolm Marx also crossed to comfortably earn the 1995 and 2007 World Cup winners a bonus point.Italy’s already tricky task became nigh on impossible when they had the prop Andrea Lovotti sent off for dropping Duane Vermeulen on his head in the 43rd minute and their slim hopes of progressing now rest on beating the All Blacks for the first time.“It was tough in the beginning, we knew it would be a forward battle, so from the first scrum we wanted to give everything,” South Africa’s captain, Siya Kolisi, said. “We wanted to control the set-pieces, because they are very strong in that, and we did that today.Italy had spoken before the game of how discipline would be crucial in deciding the outcome but they failed to back their words with action as they struggled to match the physicality of their fired-up opponents. It was not vintage from the Boks despite the scoreline, but there were enough signs of improvement from their opening 23-13 loss to the All Blacks to suggest they remain a real threat.South Africa took the lead from an early attacking lineout as the ball was spun wide to the dazzling Kolbe, and he stepped inside and out to beat two defenders and score in the corner. The Boks were rewarded for some positive play to score their second try as Handré Pollard turned down a kickable penalty, and from that attacking set-piece they were able to muscle the ball over the line through Mbonambi for a 17-3 half-time lead.Italy, desperate to get back into the game, started the second half with a thrilling break into the South Africa 22 but, having been awarded a penalty for off-side only five metres from the line, Lovotti inexplicably tipped Vermeulen through 180 degrees and allowed him to fall on to his head for a clear red card.With that went any realistic hopes for Italy and, after Pollard’s clever kick out of hand set Kolbe in for his second score, Am intercepted for the bonus-point try and Mapimpi profited from a neat chip by Willie le Roux to also cross. Snyman got on the scoresheet when Matteo Minozzi’s high-risk, low-reward blind reverse pass was collected close to the line by the lock, and Marx then barged over from a driving maul with the final play of the game as a deflated and defeated Italy crumbled.“We played against a very strong side,” the Italian captain, Sergio Parisse, said. “We tried to come back in the second half but after the red card it was very difficult. It’s tough for us, but we must keep going forward. We are very disappointed, but we must try and finish well against the All Blacks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b39409a1a8faf891f088f5bffc49f797ae730f/593_82_2424_1455/master/2424.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0135053cffaa679daf2a1e1da6c73e0b","title":"south africa v italy rugby world cup 2019 live","story":"It was billed as a potential banana-skin fixture for South Africa - after all, a loss today and they’d be contemplating a Rugby World Cup group-stage exit for the very first time.But there’s something very impressive about this Rassie Erasmus-led Boks outfit - as Italy discovered today to their detriment.No nerves, no hesitation. It was a paired-down style of play early on, built from robust defence and keen discipline. Just six penalties (after they conceded nine, and some crucial ones at that, against the All Blacks), some incredible hits, but more than that, a grinding, consistent, controlled malevolence.The red card to Lovotti killed Italy, but the body blows had already been struck by then. The rolling maul was unstoppable, the lineout unflappable, and the work at the breakdown was not too shabby either.Knockout stage opponents will look nervously at the permutations that lie ahead now. This is a team you want to avoid - not just because they might beat you - but because even if they don’t, they’ll put you through the absolute wringer (and your next opponents then might).The Japan 2019 dream is over for Italy, but for South Africa it may yet just be taking form.And it’s a big triple-header of rugby action from the Japan World Cup tomorrow. We start with Australia playing host to Uruguay for entree, then it’s the very tasty main course of England v Argentina, with a Japan-Samoa clash for pudding.

Here’s the latest from Gerrard Meagher:While Paul Rees takes a detailed look at the high-flying host nation - on an unprecedented four-consecutive-World-Cup-wins:So, if you’re just joining us now (long lie in in Italy?) here’s the executive summary:And here’s how the overall tournament top scorers list looks:What a tournament for hookers this is turning into - first a double for Tolu Latu, now it’s Bongi Mbonambi showing the wingers how to do it.For Rassie Erasmus, he’d be delighted with what he saw from his chargers. He said pre-game he didn’t need to overanalyse the performance - he just wanted the result.Well he got both. A thumping result, and a pretty decent performance as well.Yes, there were some handling concerns in the first half. From the set piece the backline look nowhere near as fluent as it should have been. It was far from a flawless showing from the Boks. But if you’re crystal-balling ahead to the knockout stages this is a side anyone would want to avoid, if they’re in this kind of form. Unflinching, unswerving from their responsibilities. A team very much on the front foot.For Conor O’Shea and his coaching staff, they’d be pulling their hair out (if any was to hand) after no doubt weeks and months of planning, nights spent tossing and turning, and countless idle hours coming up with winning schemes.That couldn’t have gone much worse for the Italians. It started with the loss of prop Simone Ferrari - inside a minute - with a suspected hamstring tear. His replacement succumbed to concussion after a nasty bump on the noggin inside just 18 minutes. And then, just minutes back onto the pitch after a bruising first half, a third prop - Andrea Lovotti, saw red. A justified sanction at a World Cup where repeatedly we’ve heard that protection of the head must be paramount. And he and Quaglio then dumped the unfortunate Vermeulen right on his.So - let’s take a look at the tables with that result included:With a massive points differential and a second bonus point secured, South Africa leapfrog Italy into top spot in Pool B - albeit with the All Blacks still with a game to play.Let’s be very clear though - any talk of the Springboks missing a quarter-finals berth, for the first time at a Rugby World Cup, can be well and truly put to bed.And there it is! As dominant a performance as you’ll see against a tier one nation at this World Cup.We wondered how they were feeling after that narrow loss to the All Blacks, and tonight South Africa well and truly fired a warning shot across the bows of world rugby.Ferocious, ruthless, imperious. What a showing from the Springboks.80 min: They play past the gong, the Boks. And why not when you’re in this mood. And it’s the veteran, who crashes over after another truly dominant rolling maul from the Boks. They showed us that early in the piece, and then tucked it away for a while. But what a fitting way to finish this match!No extras from Pollard. We must have hurt his feelings.78 min: Concern late on for South African fans - it’s Kolbe off on another of his mazy runs, but he appears to have pulled up lame. A big worry if that will affect his place later on in the tournament - what a game he’s had today, the diminutive winger.76 min: They pressing for a baker’s round 50 (don’t @ me), the Boks. They were unrelenting in their pressure first half, and now they’re making hay and enjoying themselves. The fullback Minozzi got himself in a real mess after great defensive pressure from Kolbe, and it was easy as you’d like for Snyman to open his account. 73 min: It’s South Africa, unsurprisingly on the attack once again, and Mapimpi, having just opened his account for the match is suddenly lurking like a vulture for a second.He’s denied metres short of the line, but it feels very much just a matter of time before Gli Azzurri’s (did I get that one right?) line is breached once more.70 min: It’s dejection all round in the Italian coaching boxes. Conor O’Shea called for a Herculean effort from his chargers, but about now thoughts start turning to damage control, and ensuring they have something left for the clash with the All Blacks.They’ve never beaten New Zealand, Italy. That’s now what they have to do to stay alive.67 min: And lest anybody feel they’re missing out, after the Kolbe show (in flashes) we’ve got a try for South Africa’s other winger. Mapimpi helps himself to one, and it’s well and truly time to call the vet in. It was a chip down the middle, and the winger strolls in easily, under the posts.Pollard strikes the conversion, two more points.65 min: So after the war of attrition that we’ve seen, no surprises that both sides have almost entirely emptied their benches. Plenty of fresh players on in both green and blue.A close up of a dejected Sergio Parisse on the Italy bench. His side has been clattered, and the veteran hangs his head - knowing that the World Cup miraculous is now beyond them.An Italian lesson on the run for yours truly. Too much time covering Barbara Bonansea and her pals at the FIFA Women’s World Cup, clearly.Apologies to Azzurri fans of either gender, plural or singular. That’s what happens when I try fancy things.Back to haddock and chips, me.60 min: So. The last time these two sides met it finished 35-6 in Padua. This one looks like it might get a little nastier than that. But before you despair, Azzurri fans, remember that just over 20 years ago in Durban it finished 101-0. Even with their tails up, I can’t see the Boks putting on 15 tries today. 57 min: Cometh the hour, cometh off the wheels. They’re done now, Italy. Am with an acre of space to run into - these boys are hard to stop with fifteen out there, let alone 14.A big turnover from Italy, as a forced pass fell nicely into the arms of the flying outside centre. And he’s cantered home from 40m out.Pollard back on the money, with the conversion attempt.55 min: They’re on the attack again, South Africa - this could get nasty.Le Roux flicks a lofted pass to Am, but the Italian scrambling defence covers well. The ball falls to ground - is there a chance to counter attack? No! It’s Kolbe, who bundles his opponent into touch!52 min: And here it comes! The man advantage is going to be exploited at some stage, and he’s in for a double, Kolbe. The smallest man on the field, but with the fastest feet, you’d warrant. Pollard looks for him with the crossfield kick, and he claims it nicely.And remarkably - turns out he is human - Pollard’s missed one! A tricky touchline special, but meat and drink for this guy.50 min: Pollard. Three points. And those are the first of the half. Remarkably.What a test of character this will now be for the Italians. They’ve been battered for 50-odd minutes, now they have to chase a 17-point deficit, with 14 men.49 min: A string of infringements - Italian hands everywhere, and we have a chance for Pollard to aim at the sticks. Benefit of the doubt says desperation, but gee.47 min: It’s the box kick from Tebaldi and Parisse almost regains, but they counter attack quickly the Boks. Oh my! But with Le Roux flying down the wing, he puts it on the toe - but scuffs it straight into touch! He looks embarrassed the fullback - he’s duffed that.46 min: Italy with some sustained possession, but largely going side to side. And the Boks are able to clear their line. Italian lineout feed just inside South Africa’s half.44 min: No try! It was “Two metre Pieter” who crashed over - and it looked like Italy’s game was going to instantly head south, but the try has been chalked out for obstruction in the lead up. Good spot, refereeing team. No floodgates opening - just yet.43 min: A minute of madness for Le Azzurri - they had made a terrific break, had South Africa scrambling, but in a flash of bad temper, they’ve lost a third prop of the game - two from injury, one from insult. Silly, silly business.42 min: It’s a big bust by Steyn for Italy! He looks for the support runner, Tebaldi is there but he’s swamped by covering defence. They’re eventually pulled down and we halt for a penalty.There’s another dodgy cleanout from the Italians, and Vermeulen remains injured. Ay, ay, ay. It’s a very nasty tip tackle from Lovotti and Quaglio - and it’s a red card!Not the start the Italians would have wanted.No rest for the wicked, and we’re back. Pollard gets us going and the South African tackling ferocity continues. A five-man lineout this time from the Boks, but again their backline move doesn’t work, as they cough up another easy turnover.“I haven’t seen anyone bash anyone like this all World Cup”. That’s the half-time assessment from the antipodean commentary crew I happen to be watching - is that your read as well?And from an Italian perspective then, how do you counter this?So. Your reflections on that opening 40? And is there any way back for the Italians?It felt tough, unrelenting, and extremely physical - even despite the lack of scrums.I have to admit, I don’t think I’ve seen a team lose two tight-head props inside twenty minutes in a game of rugby before. Anyone? Classic tales from yore?39 min: They build the phases, the Boks, but they’ve conceded a penalty, as the skipper arrives late to a clean out. Italy clear their lines, to huge relief.And there’s the gong. South Africa will be pretty happy with that showing - they’ve hammered their opponents, unrelentingly.37 min: South Africa play to the backs this time, but its du Toit who pops up in the line, and pops up the ball! Can’t blame the backs for that one.Kicking error for Italy - as they kick into touch after a pass back into the 22m. South Africa with a big chance to really hurt their opponents on the scoreboard, just before half time.35 min: It’s another stoinking rolling maul from the Boks, gaining 10-15m at a canter, and it earns another penalty as Mbonambi is caught slightly high.34 min: It’s against the winger Benvenuti for cleaning out illegally - he did appear to grab a South African player around the head. Clear penalty - a fifth against the Italians already.32 min: The crowd comes alive (at least the Italian quotient of it). Again, it’s a big mean green wall that greets them. This has been ferocious tackling from South Africa.The fullback Minozzi tries to get around his tackler, but runs out of territory. Italy recycle, but we stop for a TMO. Was there a high tackle?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea0f51450c77b1ad9273d4bbf62c94c67332e0cb/995_262_5336_3202/master/5336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7cee61ea571c832c91e4a06b4a298d6","title":"elf lyons funniest things","story":"The standup, writer and actor on the things that make her laugh the mostHarriet Dyer.

But, as reported by the journalist Judd Legum, in the last week the rules have narrowed considerably, only banning adverts that “include claims debunked by third-party fact-checkers, or, in certain circumstances, claims debunked by organisations with particular expertise”.Under Facebook’s third-party fact-checking programme, it invites independent organisations such as the UK’s Full Fact to verify claims posted to the social network. But the groups, made up mainly of small charities and nonprofits, are heavily constrained in how many claims they can fact-check, meaning they often only verify the most viral cases.But even that limit has been lifted for political adverts. A separate policy introduced by the social network recently declared opinion pieces and satire ineligible for verification, including any website or page “with the primary purpose of expressing the opinion or agenda of a political figure”. The end result is that any direct statement from a candidate or campaign cannot be fact-checked and so is automatically exempted from policies designed to prevent misinformation.The changes, Legum reported, followed a run of Donald Trump adverts that contained false claims but were not removed under the old rules.A Facebook spokesman said: “We don’t believe that it’s an appropriate role for us to referee political debates. Nor do we think it would be appropriate to prevent a politician’s speech from reaching its audience and being subject to public debate and scrutiny.”Facebook’s decision comes as the rival service TikTok takes the opposite stance. In a blogpost, the social network, whose reported 500 million users would make it the largest in the world not owned by Facebook, made clear it would not be hosting any political adverts.TikTok is a video-sharing app which has become phenomenally popular with teenagers. Users film themselves in 15-second clips, typically set to music, and upload them to be viewed by followers and strangers alike. It has been the No 1 app on the worldwide App Store for five consecutive quarters, with an estimated 500 million users worldwide.Owned by Chinese startup ByteDance, the app as it is today is a merger of the original TikTok, which was launched internationally in September 2017, and the viral sensation Musical.ly. The latter had already become one of the most popular social media platforms for UK and US teenagers by the time it was purchased by ByteDance in November 2017. The merger meant TikTok ended up on the smartphones of more than 60 million users overnight.Bytedance has a valuation of $75bn (£60bn), based primarily on the extraordinary growth of TikTok and its Chinese equivalent, Douyin. Lil Nas X found fame overnight when his track Old Town Road was used extensively on 15-second clips on the social network. That enthusiasm took the artist to a record-breaking run at the top of the US Billboard Hot 100 chart.However, Bytedance was fined a record $5.7m in the US for illegally collecting personal information from children under 13, and has been under investigation in the UK for how it handles the personal data of its young users, and whether it prioritises the safety of children on its social network.“Any paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,” wrote Blake Chandlee, the company’s vice-president of global business solutions. “To that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level – including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.”Chandlee said the decision was prompted by TikTok’s mission “to inspire creativity and build joy”. That same rationale had been cited by the company, which is owned by the Chinese startup Bytedance, to explain why it censored posts that went against the political orthodoxy of Beijing, mentioning topics such as the Tiananmen Square killings or the independence movement in Taiwan.When the  revealed the censorship, TikTok said the rules had since been repealed and replaced with ones that “take localised approaches” to “provide an app experience that fosters their creativity”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06cd580dea24ce9b26eb9b8ca36ddf588b147ca1/155_322_4637_2782/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e2e6db1c3d8578fa5b5eb0ba99489c7","title":"send tip small european ski resort win 200 pund hotel voucher","story":"Tell us about a favourite quieter resort in Europe with a relaxed atmosphere and some local flavourIt could be a bijou ski area tucked away in an obscure valley, an accidental find while heading off cross-country, or a less developed area with an old chairlift away from the main resort starting in a hamlet.

If there has been a fair amount of Horgan in the main character of hassled, tetchy mother Julia, – played by Anna Maxwell Martin – then there also must be, at least from the outside, some of her in the new character Meg. Impressive and wildly successful, Meg is a woman for whom motherhood and work are tackled with energy and ease. “I just do what I need to do when I need to do it,” she says. Meg is suspiciously close to “having it all” – though in Horgan’s world, nobody does. Julia looks at her with envy and awe, which is possibly not a feeling unfamiliar to anyone who has been following Horgan’s career.Horgan is impressive and wildly successful, and gives a good impression of not being a mess: not only has Motherland been commissioned for a third series, but Horgan has written and directed an episode of Modern Love, a romantic comedy anthology based on the New York Times relationship column (as a mark of Horgan’s pulling power, her episode stars Tina Fey). The comedy for which she is probably best known, Catastrophe, ended earlier this year after four series, while Divorce, a show she created for Sarah Jessica Parker, finished in the summer.“Her work ethic is insane and it was sort of terrifying back at the beginning because my idea of work in those days was to talk about it in the pub, not to actually do it,” says Dennis Kelly, who co-wrote with Horgan the brilliant, excruciating 2006 comedy Pulling, about three, single, thirty-something women which ran for two series and a special before being inexplicably cancelled by the BBC. They also co-wrote the 2016 comedy The Circuit, about the horror of middle-class dinner parties.The pair met in the early 90s at a youth theatre, then bumped into each other a couple of years later in a pub in north London. He mentioned he had written a play and the next day Horgan phoned him to say they should put it on together. “I honestly think, had I not bumped into her, I wouldn’t have become a writer,” he says, “because I don’t think I’d have had the drive. Sharon always had a lot of drive and was quite fearless.” He says Horgan hasn’t changed much since they first met. “She was funny as fuck. We started working together but it blurred into friendship because she was a lot of fun.”Horgan was born in Hackney but grew up in Ireland, where her mother is from, on her parents’ turkey farm. After failing to get into drama school, she moved to London, where she did some acting courses and fringe work around other jobs. By the time she met Kelly, she was in her late 20s and wondering if she would have a future in acting. Then they won the BBC’s New Comedy Award, and Horgan has been building a loyal fanbase ever since for her scabrous, unflinching depictions of life and relationships.There were other shows, including Dead Boss, a 2012 comedy set in a prison, which she starred in and co-wrote, before the success of Catastrophe, which she created with Rob Delaney – they starred as a couple thrown together by an early accidental pregnancy, inspired by Horgan’s own marriage.“She’s a writer-performer who understands the intentions of her words in a way I hadn’t experienced before,” says Jack Bayles, the producer on Catastrophe and Channel 4’s commissioning editor for comedy. Her writing works, he thinks, because “she’s in tune with the real world. Often you’ll get something that’s trying to feel dramatic and takes a long time to sell you a character or story, and she can move through plot so quickly while still delivering jokes.” Horgan is at a point in her career “where she understands production. She’s more like the US-style ‘showrunner’, and there are not so many of those around.”Kelly says Horgan is “really truthful” in her work. “That seems to be really important to her. Making people laugh really matters to her as well.“When we did Pulling we were trying to make sense of what our lives were at that time – we both did shitty jobs we hated, drank way too much and got into ridiculous situations. I think Catastrophe felt like she was trying to make sense of what it was to be a mother, and the discrepancy between what we think we should be when we’re a parent and what we actually are.”Motherland scrabbles around in the same shadows, though it seems less about being a struggling mother, and more about what it means to be a grown-up – and especially a woman – at that age where life hasn’t lived up to expectations. Helen Linehan, one of Horgan’s co-writers on Motherland, came up with the idea and she and her husband, the writer Graham, took it to Horgan.The second series is written by four women. “We bounced ideas off each other and shared experiences,” says Linehan. “She’s very generous with her laughter, and making her laugh is like a massive ego boost. She’s good at realistic comedy it’s not bonkers, it’s usually very relatable.” She has managed to retain that, despite her acclaim and the move into the world of giant US budgets and movie stars. “She’s very down-to-earth,” says Linehan. “I don’t think that her explosive stardom has made her into any kind of insane a.” Although, she adds with a laugh, “she always has a lovely bag.”Horgan can come across as guarded in interviews, but Kelly says she has never been interested in creating a high profile for herself. “It never felt like it was about being famous,” he says. “When we were making Pulling, it was about making it the best it could be, about being honest about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/547931154278994764e1013966be6fb75c8160eb/0_92_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a18de5ad6c5121d359049b9c3fce11a5","title":"universities sackler family donations opioids","story":"Prestigious universities around the world have accepted at least $60m over the past five years from the family that owns the maker of OxyContin, even as the company became embroiled in lawsuits related to the opioid epidemic, financial records show. Some of the donations arrived before recent lawsuits blaming Purdue Pharma, the Connecticut-based pharmaceutical company that makes the prescription painkiller OxyContin, for its role in the opioid crisis.But at least nine schools accepted gifts in 2018 or later, when states and counties across the US began efforts to hold members of the family accountable for Purdue’s actions.The largest gifts in that  went to Imperial College London, the University of Sussex and Yale University. Major beneficiaries of foundations controlled by the billionaire members of the Sackler family who own Purdue Pharma also include the University of Oxford in England and Rockefeller, Cornell and Columbia universities in New York, according to tax and charity records reviewed by the Associated Press. In total, at least two dozen universities have received gifts from the Sackler family since 2013, ranging from $25,000 to more than $10m, the records show. Some sceptics see the donations as an attempt to salvage the family’s reputation. “Money from the Sacklers should be understood as blood money,” said Dr Andrew Kolodny, a leading critic of the family and Purdue who has testified against the company in court and heads a program on opioid policy at Brandeis University, which was not among the schools identified in tax records as receiving donations from the Sacklers. “Universities shouldn’t take it, and universities that have taken it should give it back.” Representatives of Sackler family members who own Purdue declined to comment. The AP reviewed charitable giving from more than a dozen Sackler family foundations as reported to the Internal Revenue Service, the Canada Revenue Agency and the Charity Commission for England and Wales. The recipients included schools in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Israel. For decades, the wealthiest members of the family have been behind major philanthropic giving in the worlds of art, medicine and education, often leading to their name being bestowed on prestigious galleries or educational entities. They were listed by Forbes magazine in 2016 as one of the nation’s 20 wealthiest families, with holdings of $13bn. Much of their giving has fuelled research in genetics and brain development. Other gifts supported medical schools, student scholarships and faculty jobs. It amounts to a small fraction of universities’ overall fundraising, but schools say the money has been a boon to important programs. When evaluating the ethics of Sackler gifts, some experts argue, it’s important to consider what schools knew about the family and when they knew it. “We’re looking at this through the lens of what people know now,” said Ross Cheit, chairman of the Rhode Island Ethics Commission and a professor at Brown University, which has accepted donations from family members. “My sense is, during the time period we’re talking about, people’s views about that source of money changed a lot.” As opioid deaths, lawsuits and protests have mounted, some schools joined with businesses and museums cutting ties with the family, but none plans to return the money. One school is redirecting unspent donations. Most schools refused to say whether they would accept donations in the future. The financial records may not capture all giving by the family. Colleges are not required to disclose donation information, and many refused to provide details to the AP. Rockefeller University accepted more Sackler money than any other school in recent history – $11m-plus from the Sackler Foundation in Canada. Richard Sackler, a former president of Purdue Pharma, previously taught at the school. Rockefeller, which enrolls about 200 students in graduate science programs, did not respond to requests for comment. Behind Rockefeller was the University of Sussex in England, which received $9.8m, according to tax records. A university spokesman said the school actually received about $4m over the past decade, while another pledge “was not progressed”. The funding supports Sussex’s Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science, which performs research of “paramount importance” that will continue for years, the school said.Oxford and the University of Glasgow in Scotland each received $5m to $6m, tax records show. Columbia University followed with nearly $5m, while Imperial College London and McGill University in Montreal each received more than $3m. The AP contacted all universities that were identified in tax records as receiving more than $1m, along with some that were not listed in tax records but previously publicized major gifts from some family members. Of those 20 schools, three – Cornell, Yale and the California Institute of Technology – said they had made formal decisions to reject future funding from the family. Some schools said they had no plans to accept Sackler funding for the foreseeable future, including Brown and the University of Washington. Most others refused to disclose their plans. At many schools, the money has already been spent. And even if officials wanted to return what’s left, it isn’t simple. There are tax hurdles and legal obstacles that can make it difficult to return gifts from charities."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e18407c895b113f9566f1777cb2849d74641e1c3/173_709_3859_2315/master/3859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bd11f5564f8762258e970b9df83b02cb","title":"arab wineries in israel tell of the palestinian struggle in each glass","story":"Restaurants that want to avoid the drink made on controversial settlements are the main clientsThe rolling green hills of Galilee were rife with wine presses back in crusader times. Today, the fertile land is part of a booming Israeli wine industry.But two wineries serve up a different story with every glass: the Arab-Palestinian tradition of winemaking.Ashkar winery, located near the border with Lebanon, and Jascala winery, further east in upper Galilee, are the only commercial Palestinian-owned wineries inside Israel.“We fill a niche,” said Nemi Ashkar during a tour of his winery in Kafir Yassif. His main clients are Arab-owned restaurants in cities such as Nazareth, Haifa and Acre, as well as restaurants in Tel Aviv seeking to avoid wine made on controversial Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank. He also sells to the famed Israeli chef Yotam Ottolenghi.Ashkar is a Palestinian citizen of Israel, also called Israeli Arabs, who comprise close to a fifth of Israel’s citizens. His family is Christian and part of the Arab communities that remained in Israel after its founding in 1948. Another 700,000 Palestinians fled or were expelled, and their descendants today remain refugees. Israel’s Arab citizens have historically played a marginal role in national politics but the country’s Arab-majority parties are now a core part of the bloc in Israel’s parliament trying to oust the long-standing prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after communities turned out in high numbers in the latest election.For Ashkar, the most important part of his business is the label inscribing each bottle, designed by his daughter, a graphic designer. It shows Iqrit, his family’s ancestral home, and its church, which is all that remains after Israeli authorities destroyed the village in 1951. “I’m telling the story of Iqrit with this wine,” he said.Amid the fighting in 1948, the 500 residents of Iqrit voluntarily left with a promise from Israeli forces that they could return soon. It never happened. Instead, after the war, Israel placed Arab communities in the new country under military rule. On Christmas Eve of 1951, Israel razed the village, destroying everything but the Greek Catholic church and adjacent cemetery.The now 1,700-strong Iqrit community, mostly living in northern Israel, has been fighting in court to reclaim their land, so far to no avail. “We will return, I am sure, despite the 70 years of evacuation,” said Ashkar.An unmarked and unpaved track leads up to Iqrit’s church, where the community gathers once a month for services, as well as for funerals. What remains of the village feels as if it’s on top of the world, isolated from the passage of time by gentle breezes and engulfed by waves of green hills all around.Winemaking had long been a favourite pastime in Iqrit. While alcohol is forbidden in Islam, wine was popular among Arab Christians, although its presence in the Middle East has severely diminished over the last century.“It was a hobby,” Ashkar said. “My family and my grandparents were winemakers just for family use.” Back then, they used uncultivated, native grapes for a sweeter taste than today’s wines from commercial varieties.The Ashkar family’s love of winemaking did not diminish with their move to Kafir Yassif, 30 km away. But it wasn’t until 2005 when Ashkar, working in Israel’s tech industry, took a work trip to Silicon Valley and felt inspired by the winegrowers of northern California. He started making wine again and in 2010 founded the winery.The first vineyard Ashkar bought grapes from is run by a Jewish-Israeli man, on land he said used to be part of Iqrit. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, Israel’s lands authority confiscated Iqrit’s land, as it did for other depopulated Arab-Palestinian villages, and now through various bodies loans some of this land out. In practice, it’s extremely difficult for a non-Jewish citizen to lease state land.Ashkar said he had good business relations and was now friends with the owner of the vineyard. As he moved into the commercial market in 2009, he started to buy grapes from two other nearby vineyards without an Iqrit connection and, a decade later, is looking to expand again.Jascala winery, in the village of Jish, has a similarly deeply rooted story. Winemaking was a long-standing tradition for the Kharish family, also Christian, and in 2003 they decided to start something more formal.Brothers Nasser and Richard are now the heart of the operation: Nasser, 40, cultivates the grapes, and Richard, 44, is the winemaker.Nasser had just finished a degree in political science when he returned home to help his ageing father with the farming, then being done by workers from Thailand. He decided to stay.“I feel really connected to the land,” he said of life on the vineyard. “It’s different from anything I’ve done in my life. It’s so satisfying … All of the time you’re dealing with something that grows with you.”Jascala now makes 30,000 bottles a year and sells it mainly in Ramallah and Jerusalem, as well as Haifa, Nazareth and Tel Aviv.There is, however, a limited market within Israel for non-kosher wine: both Ashkar and Jascala are not kosher according to the Jewish dietary restrictions that dominate Israel’s food market. Kosher wine can only be produced by Sabbath-observing Jews in regulated conditions or alternatively boiled, which lessens the quality. An Israeli citizen, Nasser Kharish, said he also identified as Palestinian, which “is difficult for Jewish Israelis to hear that. But it’s true. I’m Palestinian. I’m part of the people.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5684353932657834855b8b9f0bccc9b4e5bfbcd/0_112_1476_885/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c72a3a335a6f2f626c23655466eb517","title":"funniest things that happened this week upside weekly","story":"In such serious times it’s getting harder to find humour in the news.

One-hour commute.My colleague Marina Hyde is always funny – though be warned: she is fabulously rude too.A jolly Sydney Morning Herald piece ripped into a new TV hit.There was plenty of value to be had in a British prime minister mentioning “kangaroo’s testicles” in a speech.A pub had a party at which everyone was called Nigel.The Economist had fun examining the far-fetched prospect of Donald Trump’s border moat. One-minute read (paywall).The New Yorker still maintains a daily commitment to satire.In the UK meanwhile, deaths from breast cancer have almost halved over the past 30 years.I would love to read an article on what can be done about the huge amount of plastic that we generate everyday by using milk and orange juice cartons. Alternatives, campaigns, are the supermarkets working on this?Well, of course we have written various pieces on this, for example here, here and here.Still on the theme of all that unnecessary plastic:Thanks for a great article about environmentally sound menstruation products. I have been using the same 6 pads since 2002 or thereabouts. They are in cotton, and I just wash them in the washing machine and then use them again. They have little buttons on their wings to keep them tethered during use. Probably not great for the manufacturer, but multi-use pads is probably by far the most environmentally friendly menstrual protection.Out in the Pacific, where a new technology finally looked like it might work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6d9da6df6d28a59ea094285d2d06695008a4985c/0_412_5521_3311/master/5521.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61cbec13db85505089267aed6c689471","title":"holland the netherlands dutch government rebrand","story":"As part of new strategy, the Netherlands will be official name at Eurovision in MayThe Dutch government has decided to stop describing itself as Holland and will instead use only its real name – the Netherlands – as part of an attempted update of its global image.The national rebranding, which has been signed up to by business leaders, the tourist board and central government, will be rolled out later this year.Ministers want to shift the international focus from certain aspects of national life with which the country is commonly associated, such as its recreational drug culture and the red-light district of Amsterdam.As part of the new strategy, the Netherlands will be the official brand at the Eurovision song contest, which takes place in Rotterdam next May, and during the Olympic Games in Tokyo in 2020.The nation’s football team, which is often referred to abroad as Holland, will solely be called the Netherlands in any official setting.A spokeswoman for the ministry of foreign affairs said the Netherlands needed a more uniform and coordinated national branding. She said: “We want to present the Netherlands as an open, inventive and inclusive country. We’ve modernised our approach.“What is special is that agreement has now been reached with relevant parties from both the government, Netherlands Board of Tourism and Conventions and private organisations including top sectors and the Confederation of Netherlands Industry and Employers about the image of the Netherlands that we want to present to the rest of the world in a substantive and unambiguous manner.”She said the government was taking a a user-friendly and pragmatic approach to its name in order to boost exports, tourism, sport and spread “Dutch culture, norms and values”. She said: “It has been agreed that the Netherlands, the official name of our country, should preferably be used.”North and South Holland are provinces on the western coast of the Netherlands. From the 10th to the 16th century, Holland was one political unified entity and ruled by the counts of Holland.By the 17th century it was the dominant part of what was then the Dutch Republic. The kingdom of the Netherlands, from the Dutch Neder-landen, meaning low countries, emerged out of the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.Earlier this year, the Dutch tourist board, whose website address is Holland, said it would be moving its focus from promoting the Netherlands as a whole to drawing attention instead to less well-known parts of the country.As many as 42 million people are forecast to visit the country annually by 2030, up from 18 million in 2018. Amsterdam’s well-known attractions are a major pull factor, leading to complaints of overcrowding in the Dutch capital."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Northern Ireland Secretary suggests move could ease concerns over handing DUP a veto over post-exit arrangementsBody of Fin whale, second biggest animal on the planet, is spotted by passengers on a ferryMore than 4,000 homes and businesses in Galway, Mayo and Kerry without powerT\u0026aacutenaiste says the only people saying Johnson\u0026rsquos proposals will work are the DUPDUP leader reacts angrily to Dublin reaction to Boris Brexit planThe four male teenagers, one of whom is an adult, were questioned over incident in JulyMore than 64,000 students due to receive results, almost a month later than scheduledAdaptation to prevailing winds leaves trees vulnerable, says botanic gardens expertLicence holders consider \u0026lsquoexit\u0026rsquo from market over criminality and neglectBudget initiative will target \u0026lsquovulnerable but viable\u0026rsquo firms to support in no-deal scenarioRedevelopment to be \u0026lsquoabandoned\u0026rsquo unless councillors sanction \u0026euro7m deal with BartraConcerns have also been raised about the number of health and safety incidents on the siteColin Farrell and Glenda Gilson among plaintiffs in action on Celtic Tiger-era defectsNo role for officers \u0026lsquochecking documents, goods, the back of white vans and so on\u0026rsquoBrace of \u0026euro1 stamps features the Black Rose album cover and a portrait of Phil LynottFamilies of people killed in 1974 IRA attacks say they have \u0026lsquomore questions than answers\u0026rsquoFormer taoiseach says Ireland \u0026lsquohas a lot on its side\u0026rsquo in rare public commentsOnline regulator \u0026lsquowith teeth\u0026rsquo needed, committee discussing online harassment told"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4039507.1570132320!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"celebrities drawn into legal action over dublin luxury flats","story":"A number of celebrities, including actors and nightclub owners, have been drawn into a legal case against firms involved in the construction of a boom-time Dublin apartment block.The case, which was lodged against firms involved in the construction and design of the Spencer Dock Apartments in Dublin’s docklands, has been taken in the name of the owners of many of the apartments.Spencer Dock has been affected by building defects, including water ingress around window frames, while issues regarding balconies, leaks and fire alarms at the development have also been reported.The owners, who purchased the apartments for peak prices at the top of the boom, include actor Colin Farrell, who is understood to own six apartments in the development, and television presenter Glenda Gilson.Robbie Fox, the former owner of Renards Night Club, a Celtic Tiger fixture, is also listed as a plaintiff, as is his wife, Martina.Prominent figures in the Celtic Tiger property scene, many of whom were involved with developer Treasury Holdings, are also named as plaintiffs, including John Bruder and Mark Pollard. Also listed are members of developer Johnny Ronan’s family, including his brother Conor and Conor’s wife, Claire. Mr Ronan was a director of Treasury Holdings.Spencer Dock was constructed as a landmark development, with some apartments boasting their own pools. When the apartment scheme was launched in 2002, people queued in the rain on the first day viewings were available.Up to €150 million was spent acquiring units in the development in the days after they came to market, it was reported at the time. Even in recent years, duplex apartments at the scheme sold for €900,000-€1.45 million.Pyrite actionsWell-placed sources said the action, while taken in the name of the property owners, had been initiated by the firm that provided insurance warranties to those purchasing units. The company, Premier Guarantee, has previously taken out similar actions in Ireland on behalf of homeowners who have experienced difficulties with pyrite.The defendants include a subsidiary company of construction giant Sisk, which was responsible for the overall project, as well as a dozen other engineering and design firms.Among the firms listed as defendants is architect firm Scott Tallon Walker, which designed the scheme. The firm’s managing director is also listed as a plaintiff, but sources suggested this was probably due to him being an apartment owner at the scheme.A property fund linked to Davy stockbrokers is also listed as a plaintiff.Three directors of the owner’s management company, a corporate entity composed of apartment owners in a block and responsible for maintenance and upkeep, are also listed.When contacted on Thursday, several parties listed as plaintiffs said they had no knowledge of the legal action. Sources with knowledge of the matter said this was because the insurer was taking the action in their names rather than the owners taking the action themselves.No commentA spokesman for Sisk had no comment when contacted. The management agent for the apartment development did not return a request for comment, while efforts to contact Scott Tallon Walker were unsuccessful.While apartments in the scheme are still in demand, and can rent for upwards of €4,500 a month, it has been affected by a series of alleged building defects. Most recently, an agent acting on behalf of receivers now responsible for some apartments in the development wrote to tenants in relation to “potential defects in the window frames of the apartments”.It is understood that water ingress has been detected around the frames of the windows.Sources said the action was probably being taken to aid Premier Guarantee in recouping any charges it had already been hit with, or may be hit with in the future. Purchasers would have, along with their apartment, bought a warranty from Premier Guarantee at the time of purchase.Premier Guarantee did not reply to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4040214.1570192454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ho ho ho turns to no no no as fota cannot honour discounted santa tickets","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFota Island Resort says to honour all booking at the discounted rate would cost it around a quarter of a million euro. Image via Facebook. A series of unfortunate events has turned what should have been a “Ho Ho Ho” into a “no no no” for a Cork holiday resort and more than 1,000 families who thought they had booked discounted visits to see Santa in the run up to Christmas.Just over 1,200 people who this week booked and paid for visits through the Fota Island resort website at a discount of 50 per cent have been left fuming after learning the hotel is not going to let the bookings stand at the prices paid.The Fota Island Resort in Cork told The  the discounts were applied in error as a result of a computer glitch and it is not able to honour the bookings.At full price the Santa experience at Fota costs up to €28 for each child plus an additional €18 for each adult so a family of three children and two adults can expect to pay €120 at full price compared to €60 at the discounted rate.Adopting a jolly festive tone on Facebook on Thursday morning, the Fota Island Santa experience said the discount code “will not apply to anyone that is not a Fota Island Resort member.”“Santa is checking his list and will contact anyone who was ineligible to use the code. Sending you sugar and spice, Google Glitter Finger.”If the resort had been hoping the festive language would make families learning that their bookings were at risk less angry, they will be disappointed.FuriousThe Facebook post was quickly flooded with comments from more than 600 people furious that their bookings - which they said had been made in good faith - were set to be cancelled.“I put in all my details and paid the price that was given to me,” wrote Rebecca McCarthy. “This is your error as a company and you should really honour the price that we pay.”“Santa will be checking his list??? That is in shockingly poor taste,” said Orla Holland. “Christmas spirit seems to be missing here big time.”Charlie Barrett was equally enraged. “So parents who’ve booked already will have to tell their kids their bookings have been cancelled because Fota Island want more money. I’ll be booking somewhere more deserving for my kids thanks very much.”Emily Oliver pointed out it was “pretty obvious that a discount code like this is going to be shared. If it was only for resort members, you should have issued them unique one-time use codes, as many companies do. Just because you cut corners doesn’t mean people who have already made bookings fair and square should lose their tickets!”The hotel’s Marketing Director Seamus Leahy was apologetic and accepted full responsibility as he explained to The  what had happened.He said in recent weeks the company had created a special discount code for people staying in a small number of lodges on the Fota Island property.However, as a result of a glitch in the system which emerged in the middle of the week, anyone who clicked on the “submit code” button on the website at the start of booking process would have the 50 per cent discount automatically applied without having to enter any voucher code number.The glitch was first discovered by a user at 10.05pm on Wednesday and the news spread rapidly on social media with 1,201 bookings made over the next 12 hours.Bookings“You could see the bookings grow exponentially from 10.05pm,” Mr Leahy said.Mr Leahy said he was made aware of the problem at 6.40am on Thursday but it took several hours for his team to discover exactly what was happening and why. “It was a genuine error,” he said.He pointed out that if the hotel was to honour the discounted bookings for the 1,200 people who had been able to exploit the glitch, then several thousand others who had paid full price to see Santa would have cause to feel aggrieved.He said to offer the discount to everyone would cost in excess of quarter of a million euro and would severely compromise the resort’s ability to host Santa this year.He said what the resort was planning to do was offer a full refund to people who booked on Wednesday night and Thursday morning or to honour those bookings once the difference between the discounted and the full price was paid.He said a third option was for people to move their appointment with Santa to a different day or time that might be more affordable.Under EU rules, while contracts are in place when confirmation emails are sent and money changes hands, they\u0026nbspare not typically enforceable if they are the result of genuine errors so demands that the hotel honour the discounted bookings are likely to fall on deaf ears.“I know that not everyone will be satisfied with what we are proposing and will feel that they should be able to avail of the discount but we are not able to do that,” Mr Leahy said.He said the hotel was holding its hands up and admitting it was responsible for the glitch and expressed remorse that what is a special event in the lives of families had been soured.“This day is about making people happy and giving people the best possible experience, one they will remember and I think we do that really well here.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4038809.1570095216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk applications for irish passports in 2019 already exceed last year","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tApplications for Irish passports have been steadily increasing since 2016. Photograph: Alan BetsonThe number of applications for Irish passports from Britain and Northern Ireland in the first eight months of the year has already exceeded the total received in 2018.New figures released to Fianna Fáil’s Niall Collins show that there have been 85,517 applications to the end of August this year, compared to a total of 79,513 in 2018. The increase has been driven by a surge in applications from Northern Ireland, with almost 9,000 more applications received at the end of August.Applications have been steadily increasing since 2016, when the UK voted to leave the European Union. In 2015, there were just under 26,000 applications, less than a third of the total received so far this year.Mr Collins said the figures “are a clear indication that people across the UK and Northern Ireland have realised how serious the impact of Brexit will be.”“The Irish passport has always been held in high esteem, and it’s becoming obvious that Brexit has compounded the demand as people living in the UK and Northern Ireland become increasingly worried about what impact Brexit will have on their daily lives and their ability to travel. I expect these figures will continue to increase over the next few months as uncertainty over a potential no-deal Brexit prevails,” he said.Entitlement to an Irish passport is governed by Irish law, particularly the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 1956."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4040053.1570180364!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit bonnie greer says ireland owes the uk nothing","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBonnie Greer told Question Time: ‘Ireland owes this country (UK) nothing. Ireland owes this country no concessions, it owes it no quarter, it owes it nothing.’ Writer Bonnie Greer has said Ireland owes nothing to the UK when it comes to Brexit and said it was unrealistic for British political leaders to expect the US to agree a trade deal that “shafts Ireland”. Speaking during a Brexit debate on BBC’s Question Time TV programme on Thursday night, the author and journalist warned the US would not agree to a trade deal with the UK that damages its relationship with Ireland.“I hear people talking about Ireland as if this country owns Ireland. Ireland owes this country (UK) nothing. Ireland owes this country no concessions, it owes it no quarter, it owes it nothing,” she said. She said the United States is Irish, and referred to the prominence given to St Patrick’s Day in the US. She said people in the US were very serious about Ireland. “Don’t mess with it. Don’t make it look bad.”She continued: “If anybody thinks that they are going to get a deal through and have a trade relationship with the United States that shafts Ireland, you have got another thing coming. It is not going to happen.”Greer, who works for the New European newspaper, also accused the British government of failing to take the peace process in Northern Ireland seriously enough. She described the Good Friday Agreement as a truce that had brought peace to Northern Ireland. “It is a truce because the United States of America and the EU sat down with this country to make it happen. We have to be much more serious about this,” Greer said. The programme also dealt with how Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle is being treated with Greer suggesting it was an example of how it is “bad being a foreigner in this country right now.”Asked by the audience why she believed this, Greer responded: “I have a friend who is Polish. She has lived here since about 2000. Her little girl was born here. She does not speak Polish to her anymore on the bus or the Tube because people abuse her.”Greer said her friend was unable to speak to her daughter in her native tongue in public because she is “maligned and hassled”. - Agencies Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit.

What we learn from SEIS will shed light on how Mars formed and evolved.”Created with Sketch.

It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times. Your back is covered in a thousand red scratches.”During the filming of the sequel to Steven Spielberg’s Jaws, cast members were terrified when real hammerhead sharks started circling them in the sea. The trouble was that their screams went unheard. The crew didn’t think they were in real danger to start with because it was written into the script that they yelled for help at that point.330 Sylvester Stallone and Dolph Lundgren – Rocky IVThe fourth in the Rocky film franchise to focus on the boxing career of the fictional Rocky Balboa, played by Sylvester Stallone, has some gripping and authentic-looking fight scenes. It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour. That is one reason why Paramount was nervous about getting him involved in Francis Ford Coppola’s mafia film. It didn’t start well, when on the first day of shooting, the actor who played the patriarch in the family, Vito Corleone, missed his overnight flight from LA to New York. His scene was rescheduled for the next day, but it cost producers $40,000.In his autobiography, rapper Gucci Mane said he was so tired on set of Harmony Korine’s crime film Spring Breakers, that he fell asleep during his big sex scene. The rapper, who plays Big Arch, a rival drug dealer of James Franco’s Alien character in the film, is seen having sex with one woman, while another sucks his toes. “I couldn’t keep my eyes open. I was knocked out, snoring . . . Harmony kept having to wake me up for takes.” In another interview, he explained why he was so exhausted. “I had a concert down there in St Petersburg, Florida, one of the days I had to shoot a scene. Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.130 Margot Robbie – The Wolf of Wall StreetThe actor says that acting in the scene where she has sex with Leonardo DiCaprio on a bed of money was really painful in The Wolf of Wall Street. “I got a million paper cuts on my back from all that money! It\u0027s not as glamorous as it sounds,” she said. “If anyone is ever planning on having sex on top of a pile of cash: don\u0027t. Or maybe real money is a bit softer, but the fake money is like paper, and when I got up off the bed, I turned around to get my robe and everyone gasped. I said, \u0027What is it?\u0027 And they said, \u0027You look like you\u0027ve been whipped a million times.

The trouble was that their screams went unheard.

It’s no wonder then that during filming, Stallone actually asked Dolph Lundgren, who plays his opponent, Ivan Drago, to try to knock him out for real. But Lundgren hit him with such force that he was sent to the hospital and was in intensive care for over a week.Brando was infamous for his bad on-set behaviour.

Same night. We started shooting at 10 o\u0027clock in the evening until 1 or 2 o\u0027clock.”The action star broke his ankle while doing his own stunt on set of the sixth Mission Impossible. The scene sees Cruise completing a fast rooftop jump from one building to another, when his foot slams into the side of the wall. But instead of collapsing in a heap, he keeps going as if nothing has happened, until the end of the scene when he can be seen hobbling away. He said: “I knew instantly my ankle was broken and I really didn’t want to do it again so just got up and carried on with the take. I said, ‘It’s broken. That’s a wrap. Take me to hospital’ and then everyone got on the phone and made their vacation arrangement.”730 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen – Masters of SexCaplan was nervous when she had to take her clothes off in front of co-star Sheen in the TV series. It made her feel better that they were both shaky. But then disaster struck. “And we complete the scene, I place the hand on my breast and they yell “Cut” and he immediately walks over to a garbage can and throws up.“ Turns out Sheen had eaten something that upset his stomach, but Caplan didn\u0027t know that. She said: ”My whole self-confidence plummeted to the ground and I realised that I\u0027m a monster and anybody who touches me will immediately start vomiting and that’s just the way it\u0027s going to be.”830 Nina Dobrev and Paul Wesley – The Vampire DiariesNina Dobrev accidentally broke Paul Wesley\u0027s finger while shooting a sex scene in The Vampire Diaries.930 Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan - 50 Shades of GreyObviously this could be a load of hype to promote the first erotic film in the franchise, but there were certainly a lot of terrible sex scenes in which things could go wrong. Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele, becomes romantically linked to Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) and they act out their BDSM desires. Johnson, who wore a modesty thong glued to her body while Dornan wore a “wee bag” to protect his modesty, said: “I got whiplash once from him throwing me on the bed. So f***ing painful. I wish we had a gag reel from the shoot.”Michael Imperioli is best known for his role as Tony Soprano’s protégé, Christopher Moltisanti in The Sopranos. During the filming of his death scene in Martin Scorsese’s Goodfellas, Imperioli cut his hand on a glass and was taken to hospital, where the doctors sped in to treat his fake bullet wounds.During the filming of Groundhog Day, Murray was more irritable than usual as he was going through a orce and was prone to disappearing from set. He had been asked to get an assistant to ease communication between him, the director Harold Raims and the studio. He was against the idea, so he hired somebody who was deaf and spoke only in sign language, which nobody on set, including Murray, could understand. Ramis said: “Bill said, ‘Don’t worry, I\u0027m going to learn sign language.’ And I think it was so inconvenient that in a couple of weeks, he gave that up. That’s anti-communication, you know? Let’s not talk.”It was a small mishap for Dunham when her nude patch kept falling off in scenes that required nudity. Dunham, who plays aspiring writer Hannah in her comedy-drama TV series Girls, said: “I stopped wearing the nude patch after the first season of Girls. There’s not one guy who works on that show who hasn’t seen the inside of my vagina. You glue it over your vagina. It gets sweaty and always falls off. My male co-stars, at the end of the day, don’t care.”In one scene of Quentin Tarantino’s 2015 Western thriller, Jennifer Jason Leigh as Daisy Domergue plays a guitar. It is a vintage Martin guitar from the 19th century, worth roughly $40,000, which had been loaned out from the Martin Museum in Pennsylvania. But a misunderstanding on Russell’s part led to an expensive mistake. The valuable guitar was meant to be swapped over with a replica prop when he snatched it from her. Russell had not read the memo, though, and smashed the antique guitar against a wall, while shouting “Music time is over”. As a result, the Martin Museum – which called the guitar a priceless, irreplaceable artefact – vowed never to loan guitars out to movies again.1430  Robert Pattinson and Julianne Moore – Maps to the StarsThe Twilight and Lost City of Z actor played Jerome, a limousine driver and struggling actor, in David Cronenberg’s acerbic Hollywood satire. It was while he got intimate in the back of a car with Moore’s character, a washed-up actress, that he ran into problems and started sweating profusely. “I sweat like a f***ing crazy person,” he said. “I was trying to literally catch drops of sweat to stop them hitting her back. Afterwards she was like, \u0027Are you having a panic attack?\u0027 It was so embarrassing.”1530 Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal - Love and other DrugsHathaway accidentally stripped off too soon when she thought cameras were rolling during the filming of Love and other Drugs. She stars alongside Jake Gyllenhaal in the erotic film based on the non-fiction book Hard Sell: The Evolution of a Viagra Salesman by Jamie Reidy. “I have to remove my trench coat and be nude underneath, and I thought we were filming,” she said. “But it turned out we were just rehearsing and I got unnecessarily naked in front of a lot of people!”In a 2007 episode of the reboot of Battlestar Galactica TV series, Olmos’s character William Adama, the commanding officer of BS Galactica, is playing around with a model ship when he gets carried away by improvising and smashes it to smithereens. The model ship was, however, museum quality and according to Olmos, who had no idea at the time, it was worth roughly $200,000.1730 Allison Janney and Michael Lerner in Life During WartimeDuring a sex scene against a wall for the 2009 comedy-drama, Allison Jamey\u0027s co-star Michael Lerner went crashing to the ground. “We had to have sex up against a wall and they started spraying us with glistening stuff to make us look sweaty, but no one seemed to realise that we were standing on a marble floor,” she said. “They said ‘Action’ and he pulled me up against the wall and his feet slipped out from under him and he went crashing down on the floor. It was terrible, but it was one of those moments I\u0027ll never forget.”1830 Ryan Reynolds and Olivia Wilde in The Change-UpThe Deadpool star was taken aback when his co-star Olivia Wilde painted smiley faces on her underwear during a sex scene, that he completely forgot what he was doing. “In the scene, she’s sitting there and I take her top off and the bra off, and she has those panties on, but she’s drawn these adorable little smiley faces on them,” he said. “And I forget every line. Not just from this movie, but from every other movie I’ve done.”1930 Sean Connery and Lana Turner – Another Time, Another PlaceSean Connery and the American actress Lana Turner were filming a love scene when Turner’s gangster boyfriend Johnny Stompanato showed up uninvited. Turner was playing an American journalist who has a love affair with a BBC war correspondent (played by Connery). But her boyfriend was so jealous that he showed up with a gun in his hand, and threatened to kill Connery. Bravely, Connery grabbed the gun from his hand and twisted the boyfriend’s wrist until he fled off the set. Turner’s turbulent life continued when her daughter Cheryl killed Stompanato with a kitchen knife fearing that he was going to kill her mother after he showed up at their house in the US – but in the trial it was deemed as justifiable homicide.2030 Christian Serratos and Michael Cudlitz - The Walking DeadThe long-running TV show focuses more on blood and violence than sex. But during one scene between Rosita (Christian Serratos) and Abraham (Michael Cudlitz) things nearly went pear-shaped when they had to get intimate in front of 30 crew members, who  were drinking coffee and eating ramen noodles. Cudlitz, who was on top of Serratos, said they were nearly naked but covered – but then as they were “humping”, the cover got knocked off, leaving Serratos practically naked. The actor said: “Then we just started laughing, because it\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027s two people, we barely know each other, lying on top of each other naked.”During the filming of Blazing Saddles, a man wandered into a scene of the film. He wasn’t part of the crew or cast but when the director Mel Brooks got the man moved on, he returned again, seemingly not understanding the request. Brooks then sent over a waiver for him to sign and left him in the movie for a laugh. He can be spotted at the end of the film wearing a jumper and standing on a sidewalk watching the action as people run out of the Warner Brothers studio front gates.Not really a mishap, but it was certainly an awkward moment behind the camera for the then 17-year-old actor, who legally had to have his mother on set for his first-ever sex scene, in which he says, “It’s in. Oh, my God, it’s in.” “She got there, and I had fake sexual intercourse in front of her,” Mintz-Plasse said. “Afterwards we didn\u0027t talk about it we still don\u0027t speak about that moment.”2330 Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone – The SpecialistStallone and Stone had absolutely no chemistry in the 1994 American spy thriller, but when the Basic Instinct star refused to get naked for the shower scene, it was potentially a huge problem. Stallone admitted they had to get drunk on vodka for filming to even start. “Ok. Let it be known, I didn’t want this scene because Sharon was not cooperating. We get to the set and she decided not to take off her robe off. The director asks only a few of the crew to remain, and she still won’t take it off. I promised her I wouldn’t take any liberties, so what’s the problem? She said, ‘I’m just sick of nudity.’ I asked her if she could get sick of it on somebody else’s film. She was having none of it, so I went down to my trailer, bought back a bottle of Black Death vodka that was given to me by Michael Douglas and after half-a-dozen shots we were wet and wild.”2430 Margot Robbie and Alexander Skarsgard – The Legend of TarzanApparently Robbie – who plays Jane - punched her Tarzan co-star Skarsgard after getting carried away during the filming of their climatic sex scene. The director David Yates asked them to be a little more violently passionate. “I didn’t injure Alexander,” she said. “And I didn’t punch him in the face, at least not hard. But he’s a pretty strong guy. He can take it. We just got carried away a bit.”Cavill says he had to “apologise profusely” after he got aroused on set, adding that “It had only happened to him once”. “A girl had to be on top of me, she had spectacular breasts and I hadn\u0027t rearranged my stuff into a harmless position. She\u0027s basically rubbing herself all over me and, um, it got a bit hard.” He claimed there was nothing sexy about onscreen sex scenes. “All you’re doing is smacking your nuts against someone and nothing is going in.” But he added: “It’s not great when you’re in a professional acting environment and somebody gets a boner, is it?” It’s not just Henry Cavill who got aroused during filming a sex scene. Metcalfe, who played John Rowland, experienced the same issue during his first onscreen sex scene with Eva Longoria’s Gabrielle Solis. He said: “We were rehearsing and then the director was like, \u0027OK, get out of bed, we have to reset the set\u0027, and I was like, \u0027I need a minute.\u0027“ He added: “It doesn\u0027t happen that frequently” because ”there are a lot of people on set, and it can be very technical, but it happens from time to time.2730 Christopher Guest and Cary Elwes – The Princess BrideWhen you see the dashing Westley (Cary Elwes) fall to the ground unconscious during a fight scene in Rob Reiner’s The Princess Bride, it really happened. Christopher Guest, who was playing Count Tyrone Rugen, knocked Elwes out by accident, when he hit him on the head with the butt of his sword. Elwes also broke his toe during the first week of filming when he was “messing around” between scenes on co-star Andre the Giant’s all-terrain vehicle. But the actor, who was in his first major role, hid the injury for the rest of the film as best he could. “I was limping a bit, you can see it in some of the scenes – you can see that I was limping into the fire swamp (during a scene with Robin Wright).”The star was filming the scene in which he storms off after he discovers Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) has been renting out his brain to strangers. According to the director, Spike Jonze, a drunk extra then threw a beer can from a moving car at his head while shouting “Hey Malkovich, think fast!” Jonze liked the scene so much that he left it in the film. The extra had his day rate bumped up to $700 a day because he had a speaking role.2930 Viggo Mortensen – The Lord of the RingsWhen Aragon (Mortensen) thinks that two of the hobbits are dead in a scene in The Two Towers, he lets out a gigantic primeval cry as he kicks his helmet in anger and falls to the floor. This behaviour would seem like an appropriate response to the grief his character feels but in reality, the actor had actually broken two toes while kicking his helmet.3030 The entire cast of RoarBut whatever the mishap, nothing can surely be as bad as it was on set for director Noel Marshall’s family, who were cast in his 1981 adventure comedy film Roar? During filming, his then wife Tippi Hendren and her daughter Melanie Griffith, as well as his two sons, John and Jerry, were mauled by lions. Heddren suffered multiple scalp wounds while Marshall was bitten so many times, he ended up hospitalised with gangrene.Harris said in a statement: “I’m so pleased, and incredibly proud, to be a part of Russell T Davies’ new series. This drama,\u0026nbspBoys,\u0026nbspis two things: it is an irresistible, funny, jubilant story of young people discovering their true identities and the unalloyed joy of living life to the fullest. It is also a deeply resonant exploration of a decade when so many of these lives were cut short by the devastating effects of the nascent Aids pandemic.\u0026nbsp“Russell’s scripts chart the highs and lows of this time so beautifully and deftly, it’s an honour to tell this story.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But by late afternoon, they were down as much as 38.9 per cent.Sales also fell 0.7 per cent and bosses warned that the company will continue to struggle in the second half of the year if market conditions do not improve, pointing out that the warm weather in September is already having a negative impact.The fashion brand also suffered from the troubles of Debenhams and House of Fraser in the UK and Nordstrom and Bloomingdale’s in the US – department stores where Ted Baker had a significant presence.It took a hit of £600,000 from the collapse of House of Fraser alone.Created with Sketch.Best high street fashion buys in October 2019 Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chairman David Bernstein said: “Trading conditions have been characterised by unprecedented and sustained levels of promotional activity across the sector with, in several cases, distressed discounting from brands and retailers and heightened competition.“The group’s performance has been impacted by very difficult trading conditions throughout the period, amplified by heightened levels of consumer uncertainty across many of Ted Baker’s global markets.“The financial results we delivered in the first half were behind our expectations. Trading in the second half has started slowly, not helped by the unseasonably warm weather in September, and this will have an impact on the full-year outcome. If these trends continue, we will achieve a second-half result below that of last year.”Ted Baker, which has 560 stores and concessions around the world, spent £11.8m improving its Asian businesses and £3.5m on its footwear ision.It also announced a new partnership with Next in the UK to sell some of its ranges, following the administration of Debenhams.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is the first below-50 reading since March when Britain was last facing a no-deal crash-out from the EU.Analysts said this\u0026nbspheadline measure may be too downbeat, partly because the services PMI does not include the retail and public sectors\u0026nbspwhere activity has held up well recently.\u0026nbspNonetheless, the latest survey, together with polls on UK manufacturing and construction released earlier, is “probably giving us a reasonable steer on the underlying strength of economic activity”, said Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAlthough she still thinks GDP grew slightly in the July-September quarter, the risks to that forecast “appear to be firmly to the downside”, Ms Gregory added.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson and Brexit merchandise for sale at the Tory conference Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson doll for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberMugs with Boris Johnson\u0027s portrait for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA Boris Johnson themed T-shirt for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson and other Conservative themed cards for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBoris Johnson posters for sale at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberCopies of The Conservative newspaper are ready to be distributed during the Conservative Party conference on 30 SeptemberGET BREXIT DONE mugs alongside other Conservative merchandise at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberAssorted Conservative merchandise for sale at the party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberBooks about Jacob Rees-Mogg and Jeremy Corbyn for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberA variety of books for sale at the Conservative Party conference in Manchester on 29 SeptemberThe September PMIs for the much smaller manufacturing and construction sectors came in at 48.3 and 43.3 respectively, signalling a\u0026nbspdeeper contraction than in services.\u0026nbspSumming up the results of the three PMIs, Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS​ Markit, which compiles the surveys, said:\u0026nbsp“Brexit-related concerns dominated the September survey responses, linked by companies to falling sales, cancelled and postponed projects, a lack of investment and job losses.”Employment in manufacturing and construction also fell over the month. The reduction in construction was the steepest since December 2010.The labour market has been resilient this year, with the employment rate hovering around a record high. However, a\u0026nbspnumber of economists, including at the Bank of England,\u0026nbsphave suggested that companies have preferred to hire rather than to invest because of the persistent uncertainty over Brexit. The argument goes that firms can let workers go if their sales drop, whereas investment in machinery is a more permanent expense.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Around  years ago, as co-presenter of BBC’s live TV show Crimewatch Daily, I interviewed a man called Mick North.Mr North was a lecturer in biochemistry at Stirling University in Scotland and, shortly after giving birth to their daughter Sophie, his we Barbara was diagnosed with breast cancer and died just two and a half years later – leaving him with a toddler to bring up alone.On March , , he dropped Sophie – by then aged five – at school and headed off to work.The school was Dunblane Primary and she was shot dead by social misfit Thomas Hamilton who, armed with the four guns and  cartridges he owned legally, massacred  pupils and one teacher.In , after writing a book about the tragedy, Mr North came on the show to tell his heart-breaking story and to explain why, in , he had joined the Gun Control Network to campaign for tighter vetting.Sympathising with a man who had lost his daughter in such unconscionable circumstances, I simply said something along the lines of, “I’m not surprised” – a comment seized upon as “partisan” by the gun lobby, who then bombarded the BBC with complaints.The next day I was forced to apologise on air.Yes, it’s important that those presenting on the BBC are seen to be impartial when discussing politics but, be it Naga, citing her own experiences of racism or, in my case, sympathising with a man asking for tighter gun laws after his young daughter was shot dead, these are human reactions that should be judged using common sense, not boiler-plate rules.IN Debbie Harry’s compelling memoir, Face It, she writes about the time David Bowie was backstage with her and rock star Iggy Pop.She says: “David pulled out his c*ck – asI were the official c*ck checker or something.“He loved to pull it out, with both men and women.

It spoilt our holiday.”But she added that their day in glitzy Monte Carlo had been brilliant, saying: “It was great to see how the other half live.”I’m not saying that passengers shouldn’t be compensated for their unscheduled night off the boat.But perhaps they should view their stay in the hall from the perspective of how another half live – namely the , homeless in the UK.One of them, -year-old David Bateman, was jailed for more than three years this week after using a craft kne to rob a Sainsbury’s store in Exeter then waiting outside until the police arrived.Why  Because he was so desperate for food and a bed that he wanted to go to prison.And as The Sun highlighted this week, around , of the homeless are ex-military being failed by councils when they ask for housing support.A camp bed in a warm hall would be luxury to them.On December , I will be taking part in The World’s Big Sleepout, which aims to raise funds for the homeless.If you would like to donate, or even take part, then details are on bigsleepout.With winter coming, we should each try to do something – however small – to help those less fortunate.COUNTRYFILE viewers have questioned why a special episode was called One Man And His Dog when three out of the four handlers were female.And let’s face it, it’s not very inclusive of our female pooches, either.Though One Handler And Their Bitch is perhaps a little too modern, even for . BORIS JOHNSON has shocked onlookers by practising his “signature move” of the double thigh-squeeze, in broad daylight.“First of all he reportedly squeezed the thighs of two women either side of him at a dinner party  years ago – and now here he is blatantly proving that it is indeed ‘a signature move’.WHEN pub landlord Nigel Smith learned that no babies born in  were given his Christian name, he decided to host a party for his namesakes.More than  of them turned up to The Fleece Inn, in Bretforton, Worcs.Last weekend, I went on an old-haunts pub crawl in the city of Worcester with four of my closest schoolmates – Wendy, Sue, Sonia and Carolyn.All names that, along with Jane, Jackie, Julie, Sandra, Ian, Gary, Geoff, Nigel and many other rapidly declining monikers, firmly date us as children of the Sixties.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the case of the traditional media, he mustn’t wield the loss of his mother as a weapon to try to shut down valid criticism that questions why, for example, he preaches about climate change one day then climbs aboard a private jet the next.Princess Diana was media savvy and close friends with several influential journalists.In his recent memoir, former Vogue publisher Nicholas Coleridge relayed the story of a lunch they shared that he had gone to great s to keep secret.But as she left, he says four photographers, “sprang forward, taking a thousand snaps”.Another example of “Diana, the hunted” perhaps Later, Coleridge rang a newspaper friend to ask how the picture desk had known and got the reply: “Diana rang herself from her car, on her way to lunch. She often tips them off about where she’ll be.”Equally, on the night of her death, she was safely ensconced in the Paris Ritz but chose, at midnight, to leave in a car being driven by a man three times over the French drink-driving limit.That is not to say the media — and, in particular, the paparazzi — didn’t sometimes step out of line, but unlike her youngest son, Diana knew not to judge all by the actions of a few.Presumably, the Sussexes hope The Mail on Sunday will cave in before it gets to court, but the paper is insisting it will defend the action “vigorously”.If so, Thomas Markle will be the star witness, and potentially Meghan herself — an event that will draw far more publicity to the Duchess’s turbulent family background than any article we have all long forgotten about.During the South Africa tour, Harry told -year-old student Peter Oki he was so overwhelmed by the world’s problems that it was sometimes hard to get out of bed in the mornings.Perhaps he should try embarking on a tour of the UK, where millions of his subjects are coping with issues without the cushion of wealth and privilege he enjoys.Hard-working people who, after the daily grind of keeping their head above water, simply don’t have time to obsess over perceived slights.Of course, there is one sure-fire route to greater privacyHarry and Meghan desire it.Give up the royal title , get a full-time job and pay for your own house renovations, like the rest of us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why  Because, for the EU, the aim was never to avoid a hard border in Ireland — something these proposals plainly achieve.The aim, rather, was to keep Britain in a subordinate position, still subject to EU law and trade policy.Brussels was reluctant to spell this out in so many words — at least publicly.A fly-on-the-wall documentary caught the staff of the European Parliament’s Brexit negotiator, Guy Verhofstadt, cheering when Theresa May’s Cabinet accepted the backstop.“It took us two years,” said one, joyfully, “but we finally turned them into a colony”. Obviously, though, EU officials couldn’t take this line openly.So, instead of owning up that their goal was to keep Britain tied to their laws, they invented a story about avoiding border checks and making sure that violence did not come back to Irish politics.Still, there was a telling admission when the proposals first emerged earlier this week.Reporting on the Irish government’s response, RTE’s Tony Connelly tweeted: “The main argument against this approach is that all the technology in the world is of no usethe actual customs tarf makes your cross-border business unviable, especiallyyou’re in agrood.”In other words, it’s not about the border at all. It’s about maintaining privileged access to the UK market.At present, more than two thirds of all Irish beef exports come to the UK.Understandably, the last thing Dublin wants is for us to switch to cheaper and better beef from Australia, Argentina and the United States — something we would be able to do outside the EU’s trade rules.Many continental countries also want to make sure that Britain remains a captive market for their exporters.So when it became clear that the UK had come up with a way to avoid infrastructure at the Irish border, they moved the goalposts.What they now wanted was not an invisible border, they said, but common rules on both sides of it.Oddly, this applies only one way. No one regarded it as a threat to peace when, for example, the Republic of Ireland left the sterling zone and joined first the ERM and then the euro. But Britain signing its own trade deals is apparently unacceptable.To be fair to Eurocrats, the only reason they put these outrageous demands on the table was because there was a Remainer majority in both Houses of Parliament egging them on.The concept of keeping Britain in the customs union — or of an “Irish backstop” as Brussels officials cunningly called it — only appeared in late , more than a year after the referendum.Why  Because, by then, there had been a new election in the UK and there was now a pro-EU majority in the Commons.Labour and Lib Dem MPs told the EU, quite openly, that they would not let Britain leave except on terms agreed with Brussels — or “not without a deal” as they put it.The EU responded by offering deliberately unpalatable terms.It, like the opposition parties, plainly hopes that,the terms are hard enough, Britain will drop the whole idea of Brexit.As Michel Barnier, the Brexit negotiator, told EU leaders at the start of the process: “I’ll have done my job , by the end, the terms are so hard that the Brits would prefer to stay in.”What, then, will happen now  My guess is that the EU will reject Britain’s offer — even though it achieves all the things Brussels had said were important.It will do so because it believes the alternative is not No Deal — an outcome for which Britain is far better prepared than are the  — but yet another postponement.When MPs voted to make No Deal impossible, they were in fact making a deal impossible, because they were taking away from the EU any incentive to agree terms.If I am right —Brussels rejects the deal, and Parliament then demands another extension — we will be back where we started.But with one critical dference. It will now be obvious to the entire country that Boris was prepared to go as far as any British leader could to find a compromise.It will be clear that neither the EU nor its fth columnists in our own Parliament have any interest in any outcome short of reversing the referendum.Boris, in other words, will be able to go into a general election having demonstrated good faith.He will have done everything possible to leave on good terms, but will have been blocked by MPs who had previously promised to respect the result.Labour and the Lib Dems will, by contrast, have to go into that campaign explaining why, despite their earlier pledges, they now want to drag everything out again.Why they want months or years more of anger and broken friendships, of business uncertainty, and of Britain being made to look ridiculous before the world.

Five minutes, max, and that was me done.Then the Channel  continuity woman announced: “Richard Madeley’s going in”, and that was effectively me for the next three weeks.Glued to a series called The Circle, which could scarcely be a bigger waste of my own and everyone ’s time.As wastes of time go, though, this one’s pretty much unbeatable.It’s got a good host, for starters, Emma Willis, who has that happy knack of improving every show she guest-presents or, in this case, takes over from Maya Jama and Alice Levine.Emma, of course, hosted another famous Channel  reality show, which, above and beyond the fact the network has sold this format across the world, is the real reason it is so idiotically excited about The Circle.Finally, nine years after junking the show, it has a viable replacement for Big Brother and all that comes with it.A large building, nominations, evictions and a lot of bone-brained contestants who can message each other, inside The Circle, but never meet, meaning they are free to be whoever they want to be.Among those competing to win £,, we’ve got cat-fishing Scouser James, who’s pretending to be a single mum called Sammieand Katie, who’s taken on the identity of her own son, Jay.Hardly ambitious.The sheer effort of the pretence, though, means the most interesting contestants tend to be the ones who are just being themselves and come with a iety of sob stories and boasts, like “Crohn’s survivor” Georgina bisexual dyslexic Woody, who cannot wait to tell everyone he’s Zoe Ball and Norman Cook’s son and Brooke who refers to her breasts as “the goodies”, because they’re the exact same size as Bill Oddie’s head.Smartest and most interesting of the lot, however, is theology professor Tim, who’s keen to foster the idea he looks uncannily like Robin Williams, presumably to distract attention from the fact he looks uncannily like Harold Shipman. Which may also be the reason they didn’t stick Judy Finnigan in that house. Bad visuals.You already know who the real star is, though. It’s Madeley, who entered the show, babbling like a madman, day one, with an acoustic guitar and a keyboard.Deal was, he couldn’t win but had to take on a dferent identity.Richard fancied “an -year-old woman”but the viewers decided he should be a hot -year-old blonde called Judy.The results have been brilliant, not least ’cos Woody has flirted outrageously with “Judy” Richard, who’s had to respond in kind.It’s tinged with regret, though. The show where Richard Madeley really should be uniting a fractured nation in joy and laughter is Strictly.The Circle understands this only too well, so they had him togged up in a motion-capture avatar suit for an unforgettable game of “guess the dance” on Friday, moshing, dabbing and doing a tango that looked like Groucho Marx’s death stagger.“Forty years in journalism and broadcasting,” he sighed sarcastically, “And the pinnacle has arrived.”Yes, yes it finally has, Richard. Now seize the moment and get yourself on Strictly . A nation demands it.David Craig: “Jack Grealish does exactly what he says on the tin.”David Croft: “Vettel punched through a gap that wasn’t there.”And Matt Le Tissier: “I love scoring goals but equally almost liked creating goals as much.”BBC’S latest Far East celebrity travelogue really should’ve been called Sue Perkins Condescends To Meet Some Foreigners.But it wasn’t. They settled instead on Japan With Sue Perkins, who went “in search of the country’s soul” by dressing up as a few cultural stereotypes and probably sending children to bed with nightmares in her geisha girl outfit.If WE did that, of course, “cultural appropriation” would be the least of the accusations made against us. But it seems to be all right here, I think, ’cos Sue’s a middle-class Cambridge graduate who reads the .No matter where she travels, Sue also remains ever-vigilant for the slightest hint of sexism and clearly thought she was guaranteed plenty of that at a government-sponsored speed-dating night, along with lots of other stuff tosspots like to describe as “problematic”.Soyou want to see irony squared, watch the moment towards the end of episode two when Sue grandly tells a whole room of uncomprehending dorks: “Formality permeates every part of Japanese culture. Everything’s driven by boundaries, rules and regulations. They’ve lost the fundamentals.”And then think: “Yeah, what this country really needs is a naked dating show where contestants are judged on the state of their genitals, hosted by Sue Perkins’ missus.”That’ll drag ’em into the st Century.The consistently brilliant Good Morning Britain finding the only Piers Morgan impersonator in Japan who wasn’t wearing a wrestling nappy.Richard Madeley’s cameo in The Circle.Celebrity MasterChef contestant Joey Essex inventing the “stirotto” , which looked about as appetising as a pandopsy .And Strictly’s Mike Bushell attempting the American smooth, with Katya Jones, to that all-time Glen Campbell classic Like A Blind Stoned Cowboy.AMERICAN trailer-trash comedian Vicki Barbolak accidentally locked herself in a pink caravan at the start of her routine on Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions. Then someone from production let her out and the problems really started.Two minutes into her act, Vicki came to a grinding halt and stuttered: “I . . . I . . . I changed everything I was going to do.” And decided to shove any good material down the caravan’s chemical toilet A horribly awkward moment for everyone, though not the first sign the booking process had seriously maled with this episode.That was the previous act – Gennady Tkachenko-Papizh, from Kazakhstan, whose “ceremony of sound” went where your iPhone alarm fears to tread, making the sort of random animal noises usually accompanied by the caption “footage courtesy of PETA”.British politeness rescued him from the silence that should have followed – along with David Walliams, who said: “People are not going to forget the name . . . sorry, I’ve forgotten your name.”What I definitely will remember about Saturday’s episode, though, is the timely question Simon Cowell posed to the act that followed Gennady and Vicki, Twist  Pulse: “The people who didn’t want to compete again.

For the Tories, it is a clear goal of policy.In his ambitious speech to the conference, the Chancellor Sajid Javid – who is the son of a bus driver – declared that the Living Wage would rise over the next five years from the present rate of £.-an-hour to £.-an-hour - and the age limit lowered from  to .Altogether, it is estimated that at least four million people will benefit from these far-reaching changes.The Chancellor’s scheme exposes all the left-wing nonsense about Tory toffs.This is not the action of a Government that is driven by concern only for the wealthy or is indferent to the struggles of those on limited earnings.A modern, thriving economy cannot be built on the back of exploitation and poverty pay.Anyone who goes out to work is entitled to a level of pay that can sustain a reasonable standard of living.Those who object to Sajid Javid’s proposal should be askedthey would be willing to work for less than £.-an-hour.In fact, it is depressing that so many people who do invaluable jobs in the community, like care home workers, hospitality staff and retailers are currently paid less than this.Looking after the elderly or disabled should be well-rewarded positions, not jobs hovering at the level of the minimum wage.Indeed, ever since they came to power in , the Conservatives have prioritised the quest to improve living standards and reward those who hold down jobs.That is why the Government has dramatically cut income tax for the low paid by raising the personal allowance from £,-a-year in  to £, this year.As a result, more than four million people who earn beneath this threshold no longer have to pay income tax at all.Meanwhile, contrary to all the rancid hysteria about alleged Tory bias to the rich, the top one per cent of earners now pay  per cent of all income tax.The Conservatives’ claim to be the party of the workers is further reinforced by their jobs miracle, which far exceeds anything achieved where in Europe.When the Tories took office in , there were widespread predictions that they would preside over soaring dole queues.Just the opposite happened. In the last nine years, no fewer than .million new jobs have been created, most of them full-time.Today, unemployment stands at just . per cent, the lowest level since . Over  per cent of the population is now in work, a historic record, with more women in the workplace than ever before and wages are now growing at their fastest rate in a decade.Inflation is low, while credit and mortgages have never been cheaper, which – along with tax cuts – boosts household budgets.Similarly, a consumer study out this week showed that expenditure on dining out is at its highest level for three years.Tory economic success, in the face of Labour’s hysterical gloom-mongering, points to a fundamental dference between the parties.The Conservatives believe in providing incentives towards diligence and enterprise.In contrast, Labour is ideologically obsessed with levelling down, trying to achieve a dogmatic form of equality through higher taxes, massive redistribution of wealth and lavish social security benefits.As history has continually taught us, it is a disastrous recipe for economic sclerosis and welfare dependency.Raising pay rather than benefits is the best way to bolster living standards.A generous welfare system is a heavy drag on the economy, not only because it imposes a huge burden on the taxpayer but also because it discourages work.On the other hand, a reasonable minimum wage raises productivity in the workplace, puts more money in the pockets of employees and expands the economy.The main objection to a higher minimum comes from employers, who argue that, because of rising costs, staff will be priced out of jobs - but there is little evidence to support such warnings.The same anxieties were voiced when Labour under Tony Blair first campaigned in  for the introduction of a minimum wage.At the time, the Tories said that policy would destroy jobs, particularly among young people. But such dire forecasts never materialised.Thankfully, the Conservatives have learnt that such messages of economic doom are hollow.It will turn our economy into a pioneer, with one of the highest statutory minimums in the world.Inevitably Labour has been carping this week, with the Shadow Chancellor bleating about the Tories’ pathetic attempt at catch-up.But such language just demonstrates Labour’s fear - as their mantle of the party of the workers is steadily pulled from their grasp."},{"url":null,"title":"british tourist carries severed arm","story":"NewsBritish tourist carries severed arm to ambulance after limb ripped off in crashCha Vella was riding a dirt buggy on holiday in Mexico when the vehicle flipped, landing on her armShareCommentsByAlice Peacock:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsThe Buckinghamshire woman was involved in the horror crash while on holiday in Mexico \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Steven Stringeraposs cat, Norris Sydney Stringer, who was named in memory of Stevenaposs granddad, became so unwell following the routine procedure on September  that vets offered to put him down.  In an emotional public post on social media, Paul claims that the procedure at Pets At Home in Tamworth, Staffs, caused his whole body to become unresponsive and left Norris leless. He wrote: He can’t lt his head, move his paws and can’t hold his eyes open for a long time. They are removing the chip now so they can do an MRI scan and we are now at a specialist vets. Absolutely heartbreaking please pray for him. He added: We are absolutely distraught.”    Norris faced a fight for le in the hours following the procedure but has now defied all odds according to Pauly and is slowly recovering. A video posted to Facebook shows little Norris falling over and struggling to walk with little coordination. He has a red bandage on his leg covering a catheter and a shaved patch on his neck. Steven has now created a public Facebook page where he has urged fans of the tiny furball to follow his recovery, which has over , members. And he has asked people to donate to Cats Protection here on behalf of the vets which is now treating Norris. Steven claimed that Pets At Home are covering the bill for any treatments costs. Posting yesterday Steven wrote: “We have been given the amazing news that all being well, they are taking him out of intensive care tomorrow and onto a standard ward where he will start physiotherapy.  “He is able to eat however is still struggling to hold his head correctly so at the moment the bowl is being held for him. “He has also managed to go to the toilet which is great news. We thank absolutely everybody for all the well wishes, the support and the love and just for following us and Norris on his journey to recovery. It has been so overwhelming and have now created a page for you to follow his progress. And this morning Steven had even better news writing: Although he is going to need physiotherapy both at the vets and at home Norris might be discharged on the weekendhe continues improving as he is. They cannot confirmhe will ever be the same again but we will help him adapt under any circumstances. Microchips are typically implanted under the animalaposs skin and gives the pet their own unique code in order to trace themthey get lost.

Luckily for the couple they had a dedicated team of experienced staff on hand to help organise every tiny detail of the trip, and the Duchess explained that they made one very sweet move to make le a bit easier for them.    They arranged all the events and engagements around Archieaposs feeding times, meaning that Meghan and Harry could be there to give their son his meals. The Duchess had no engagements in the evening, which presumably meant she able to put him to bed every night as well. Asked how the tour had been, she said: “On my goodness, well, we’re doing well. I think the schedule - they have been very kind to me, because everything is based around Archie’s feed times. “So it’s a full plate, but we’re making it work.

I asked for it to be reduced to £ because I was on reduced working hours due to the loss of my daughter, which was agreed to. “Due to illness which prevented me from working I was put on full housing benefit, and in October  we had to go on Universal Credit.” As they would have had to wait five weeks for their first payment, Katie says it was agreed at the Jobcentre they could have half then and the other half at a later time.    The following month they received their first Universal Credit payment of around £ for the month. Katie recalled: “We were never told our rent was in this payment. Then we received a letter in the post from Sanctuary Housing to say we owed just over £, in rent. “We were gobsmacked to be told housing benefit had been deducting £ each month for the overpayments. We also found out our housing benefit had stopped when we went on to Universal Credit, and Universal Credit had paid us the rent and not to Sanctuary Housing like we had asked.” Katie says she rejected for discretionary housing payments due to the rent arrears as well as a repayment plans. “We were toldwe didn’t pay the whole lot off we were out,” she said. “I felt like a failure and a bad mum because I had lost our family home. There was nothing I could I do but cry.” Katie and her family were evicted at the end of February having searched unsuccessful for a private landlord. After staying with her brother in Cheshire she was housed in dferent hotels back in Torquay and then a cottage temporarily in Paignton by Torbay Council. However, she alleged they were given two weeks’ notice to find accommodation after being told by Torbay Council it no longer had a care of duty to help them. With nowhere  to go, Katie says her daughter had to temporarily live back with her father in Torquay.    Katie said: “I was devastated. My teenage daughter not being around me caused my anxiety to spiral, but I knew it was the only way. It left me and my partner on the streets and split us up as a family. “I was so angry they could do this to us I was born and breed in Devon and I was being treated like this. “We had been given a budget of £ rent allowance for a two-bed property, but nearly all properties was £ plus. It was impossible to find a home but we kept at it.” After four weeks of sleeping between family and friends, and on the streets, Katie sought the help of their local MP and social media. It prompted a team leader of housing options to overturned the decision, and Katie and her partner were reunited with her daughter and were placed back into a hotel. However, five weeks’ late they are still in the hotel in one room, and Katie says their situation has now become desperate. She said: “We are truly grateful to be given accommodation, but we are struggling being in one room and are at breaking point. My daughter and partner are sharing a room which is wrong we are living off takeaways as there are no cooking facilities which is making our health worse our room hasn’t been cleaned since we’ve arrived, and my daughter is getting detentions from school as she can’t do her online homework as we don’t have the internet.” “This situation is taking its toll on us as a family so I am pleading for help for me and my family. “All we are asking for is help to be put on Devon Home Choice to get a better chance of an affordable settled home for us, to be treated fairly, and for the local council to hold their hands up and admit that the system is at fault.

Jason, a drum and bass musician known as aposMista Xapos, wasnapost having it and posted the updates, declaring: They have been conning us all.

Sven Isle, , and Lee Harrison, , broke into the -year-oldaposs home in Goole, Hull, and crept into her bedroom as she slept in the middle of the night. The victim was woken up by banging and crashing noises coming from downstairs and heard male voices from the hallway. But when she reached to get her phone from the bedside table to try and ring police, she was unable to as the thieves had managed to get into her room without her realising and had stolen it. Prosecuting, Mr Anthony Longworth told Hull Crown Court : [The victim] went to bed at around .pm with her son and the house was fully locked and secured. She was later woken at around am after being disturbed and heard male voices downstairs and realised that she had been burgled. She was unable to reach for her phone that should have been next to her bed to call the police and she realised it must have been taken whilst she was asleep, so the burglars were aware she was there.    After around  minutes of noise, the burglar later identied as Harrison entered her bedroom and demanded to know where the x-box was as a controller had been found. She said that she did not have one, and he then demanded money. She told him the only cash she had on her was on her bedside table. Harrison then said to her aposyouaposre a lucky girlapos and left her but then, whilst on the landing said to [the victim] aposdonapost phone the policeapos and told her that they wouldnapost hurt her or her little boy. The court heard how the burglars stayed for another  minutes before fleeing with the victimaposs phone, television and keys. They had moved a kitchen kne into the living room and left it on the floor in case they needed it to threaten the victim. After they left, the victim rushed to her mumaposs house nearby in a distressed state with her son. The pair tried to take the television and goods to Isleaposs house on their bikes, but one man caught them resting the television on a car and Harrison fled. Another man then unknowingly helped Isle take the stolen television to his home in Morley Street, Goole. Isle was arrested hours later, with police finding him passed out in the garden with the stolen television next to him. During his arrest, Isle spat in a police officeraposs face, but later said he remembered nothing as he had taken strong tranquilisers.    Harrison, who had also stolen a pink bicycle in a theft days beforehand, was later found after the victimaposs brother was able to track him down. In a victim impact statement, the -year-old victim said she has still been unable toto live in her home four months on and feels too scared to ever live alone again. Mr Langworth told the court: The effect of the burglary on [the victim] and her son has been considerable. On June  she tried toto her rented property once but it made her feel sick when she realised the extent of what could have happened. Even though the locks have been changed by the landlord, she says she cannotand went to live with her mother and constantly needs company in order to complete the tasks of daily le. She was most frightened by the man in her room who told her aposyouaposre a lucky girlapos. Her son also feels unable toand has even been nervous at his grandmotheraposs house where he has been staying with his mum. She is still clearly traumatised by the burglary and feels that she will never get over what happened. The court heard that Isle already has a serious record dating back to , including battery, assault. robbery, burglary, assaulting a police officer and theft. Harrison also had a record of burglary, handling of stolen goods and the possession of a dangerous weapon.  Defending Harrison, of Station Road, Rawclfe, Miss Rachel Scott said the father-of-two had a  year drug addiction and showed genuine remorse for his actions.

Here are just some of his fascinating facts and obscure word definitions...English is the official language of  countries and  non-sovereign nations, and is the second most-spoken language after Mandarin, with over  million users as a first or second language. Avocado comes from a word meaning testicle. When the Aztecs discovered the fruit in BC they probably noted its shape, size, gnarly skin and tendency to grow in pairs. J K Rowling invented the term Muggle to refer to those in the Harry Potter universe who don’t practise magic, but the word has been around for centuries. It first appeared in the th century in an epic poem meaning “a tail resembling that of a fish” In the s, ‘muggle’ became slang for a cannabis joint. The origin of the meaning of the word chaperone as someone who accompanies or supervises another is a metaphor, because a chaperon was a hood formerly worn by nobles. In the late th century, a hundred years before the nursery rhyme, Humpty Dumpty was the name of a drink consisting of boiled ale and brandy. Sideburns were originally called burnsides, named after Union Army General and United States Senator Ambrose Burnside , who was noted for his unusual facial hair.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman born with two wombs, two cervixes and two vaginas has defied the odds by giving birth to her first child. Eleanor Rowe, , only discovered her unusual anatomy five years ago when she went to freeze her eggs and a sonographer found her second womb. The D scan showed an abnormality which led doctors to believe Eleanor had a double uterus. But it was only when doctors carried out an investigatory procedure they realised she actually had the rarer form of uterus didelphys - two wombs, cervixes and vaginas. Eleanor underwent a corrective procedure to cure the one in a million condition, but doctors warned she faced a  per cent chance of miscarrying.    But three months ago she welcomed Imogen Hope - who she carried in her left womb - with husband Chris. Eleanor from Ranskill, Nottinghamshire, said: I just canapost believe I had lived three decades and didnapost know this was all going on inside me. When I was told I had two of everything it did just seem a bit strange. And all of a sudden I found myself with this unique anatomy which I had never heard of before. Iaposd joke and say I had a designer vagina. But the only thing I was worried about was my fertility. That was my main concern. I just canapost believe sheaposs actually here. She stubbornly made it to  weeks weeks - despite what the doctors said. Although it was an early labour.    In April , single Eleanor decided to freeze her eggs after having just entered her early s, and spent £, on two harvesting cycles at a London clinic. But when she was sent for a D scan of her oies, the sonographer mistakenly thought she was having full IVF treatment and instead carried out a D scan of her womb. The results showed an abnormality on the scan, which led staff to believe she may have two wombs. Eleanor was referred to Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow for an investigative operation which revealed she also had two cervix and two vaginas.    The condition known as uterus didelphys - a rare congenital abnormality - developed when she was a feutus. She said doctors said the chance of having it was one in a million. Counsellor Eleanor said: My periods have always been irregular so I always had a hunch I would need some help with assisted conception. I couldnapost use tampons as blood would leak.    Now I realise it was leaking from the second vagina but this should have been a sign that something was wrong when I was growing up. I hit my s and I was still single so I thought it was best to freeze my eggs. I was at a stage in my le where everybody I knew were getting married and having babies. I paid for the first cycle but that was unsuccessful. After I paid for the second, the sonographer didnapost read my notes properly and just assumed I was paying for the full IVF treatment. She ended up doing a D scan of my womb instead of my oies. I thought it was a bit odd when she left to get another member of staff. They came in and told me I might have two wombs and referred me to hospital. When I was first told about it I was just really confused.    I thought how could I have gone through le and not know. Iaposm glad I did find out when I did because that meant my pregnancy could be monitored. Externally everything seemed normal, with one vagina leading to one cervix leading to one of the wombs. But inside I had a duplication of everything! Doctors remove the wall that ided the vaginas - leaving her with two cervix and wombs - in . When I was going for the operations I had nurses coming up to me and saying ‘so you’re the woman with a double vagina!’ and wanting to know all about it, she said.    When I was having surgery the doctors said the walls of my wombs were so thick I would be unlikely to carry children. They said getting a baby to full termination would be a process and that every time I would get pregnant it would help to stretch out the womb. I was also told that there was a  per cent chance I would miscarry. That was horric to hear. A year later Eleanor met technology consultant Chris at a bar in London in May  and the pair married two years later.  Eleanor said: When we became serious I told Chris about my condition. I told him it would probably be dficult to have a baby but he was very understanding. When I got married we did everything to try and raise our chances of getting pregnant. When we were on our honeymoon in Japan I made sure we rubbed the fertility tree in as that was meant to bring good luck. I tried to revamp my diet too by cutting out processed foods and even changed what cosmetic products I used. Two months after their wedding the couple discovered Eleanor was pregnant in her right - and weaker - womb. But in the first trimester Eleanor suffered a miscarriage after the fetus attached itself to the thin iding wall. Doctors were forced to medically intervene in the miscarriage as Eleanoraposs body had not done so naturally. She was induced for eight hours until she aposgave birthapos. Eleanor said: Even though I had been warned about the dficulties I would face it was still devastating. But this was the first time it had really hit home and it was a reality.    My baby had died but my body hadnapost naturally miscarried. I was given two options. To choose surgical management where they do it when youaposre asleep or medical management where they give you medication to induce contractions and instigate the aposmiscarriageapos. I wanted the surgery as I wanted to be asleep but doctors were really reluctant to carry out the termination with an operation. They told me they had never operated on someone with my anatomy. They said it would be riskier than normal and they couldnapost tell me what the risks were because they had nothing to compare it to. They gave me medication to dilate the cervix and start the contractions.  When the couple attended the funeral service for their miscarried child at the hospital, Eleanor discovered she was pregnant for a second time. She booked an appointment with her GP - where she was immediately marked her as a high-risk pregnancy and given weekly monitoring at her Sheffield hospital. Eleanor said: The timing was quite weird...I was mourning the loss of my first baby.

Period products have been pretty much the same for the past  years, with very few people using anything  when Mother Nature comes to visit. But this is now changing, and in the last few years a number of new products have hit the shelves claiming to be easier, healthier and more environmentally friendly than whataposs already on offer. Holland  Barrett is one of companies promoting these exciting new products as part of their sustainable range, so weaposve taken a look at some of the things on offer - from period underwear to menstrual caps - and they could save you a lot of cash.    OrganiCup, The Menstrual Cup - £. The OrganiCup is a reusable menstrual cup which you use instead of tampons or pads. It holds the same amount of blood as three tampons, which means you can wear it for  hours. Itaposs made entirely from soft medical-grade silicone and is reusable which means itaposs better for the environment and your bank balance. There are two dferent sized available - one for women who have given birth and one for those who havenapost. OrganiCup co-owner Gitte Dalberg-Larsen told :In  there was an article series in a Danish national newspaper about the menstrual cup and its benefits. We had never heard about anyone using it and, with all its benefits, it made us wonder: Why not     That same strain of thought made us think about why no period innovations came to be in over  years, since the introduction of tampons. This was kind of mind-boggling to us. When you consider the amount of waste that is created each month by disposable period products and the chemicals they contain that we put inside our bodies and that pollute our planet. There are a bunch of reasons we think people should give an OrganiCup a go. It’s more convenient, it’s better for the environment and it’s healthier for you. We are all becoming increasingly aware of what we put on and inside our bodies. The lespan of the cup means saving the environment for the packaging and material waste of thousands of disposables per user.  Using a menstrual cup does take some time, patience and practice. Just like the first time you used a tampon or contact lenses, it might take a few tries before you get it - so hang in there. But it’s worth any initial frustration because once you get the hang of it, it is all smooth sailing and you can sleep, do sports and swim for up to  hours without having to worry about your period. But there is more to their mission than just a dferent type of period product. Gitte said: From day one, it was always about more than cups. We believe no woman should be held back by her body. We believe period products should not contain harmful chemicals nor absorb natural bodily secretions, resulting in infections. Periods should not be the cause of major pollution. And they should never, ever be a source of shame.” Bloom and Nora Reusable pads -  pack, £. These reusable pads allow you to reduce the amount of plastic youaposre throwing away. They can be used for up to two years and claim to be better for your skin as they donapost have any perfumes, irritants or toxins. Not having to splash out for new ones every month is also very kind on the bank balance, and Bloom and Nora say using their products will save you £,. You wear the pads as you would a throwaway version, then throw it in the was at - degrees with the rest of your underwear.  The woman behind the brand is Fiona Smyth, who set up TotBots after creating a washable, reusable nappy for her newborn baby girl.  years later, inspired again by her daughter, she decided to have a go at making a sanitary product. Shes said: Even though disposable pads are a waste issue and take hundreds of yeas to biodegrade, the chemicals in pads and tampons were actually my biggest trigger. It wasn’t until I read an article mentioning dioxins and carcinogens in the same sentence as pads and tampons, that I decided it was time to get back to the design table and do something about it. The Bloom pads have a natural bamboo core and come in a range of bold colours, whole the Nora range have a stay dry, stain repellent core in simple bright white Flux Undies Period Proof Underwear - £. An alternative to disposable pads, these knickers have a washable and reusable pad built in.

Anybody looking at the league will say ‘those two should coast it’ but it’s never as simple as that.“I knew it wouldn’t be.“It’s a tough league – that’s why United have been in it so long, why Hibs took a while to get out – Hearts were the exception.“They had the chance to build for this league beforehand, though.“It is a tough job but I’ve said that from day one – I’m not just saying that because we have had an average start to the season.“I make no excuses for that and I know it will get tougher as the season goes on but I know we will get better.“The longer my team is together, we will start to see a real fluency very soon.”With almost an entire new squad brought in over the summer, James accepts Dundee are behind others in the ision when it comes to building a successful squad for the Championship.However, he says there are signs that is coming at Dens Park as they bid to overhaul the three teams above them – Dundee United, Ayr and Inverness Caley Thistle.“Ayr are a good side,” James added.“I saw a fair bit of them last year and it’s no surprise they are up at the top. They were really good when they came to Dens and they have a real consistency.“It’s been a very similar squad they’ve had for a few seasons now, a successful one that came up and Ian McCall added quality to them.“Inverness are the same and that shows the need for consistency in your approach in this league.“The teams that do well have that.“We had a big sht in terms of players and staff – it’s been a huge turnaround.“Everybody wants it to happen at the click of a button, everybody hits the ground running and you get off to a flyer but it’s not easy.“I think anybody you speak to will say it’s dficult to firstly get people in the door and then get everybody playing together.“We are getting there. It is tough but nothing we didn’t expect.“It’s up to me and my staff to find the right way of getting an effective team on the pitch to start turning the good play, which there has been a lot of, into goals.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-7-846x564.jpg ","title":"va dundee issue call out for people of tayside to share their mary quant stories ahead of new exhibition","story":"VA Dundee are on the lookout for people living in Tayside who may have worn or made garments designed by Mary Quant.The museum wants to hear from anyone who has a photograph of themselves wearing a garment designed by the iconic fashion designer, before the exhibition opens in Dundee next year.They#re also looking for people who made an item of clothing from a Quant dressmaking pattern, in an effort to learn more about the designer#s influence on communities across the country.Her creations, which captured the spirit of London in the s,were sold in high-end boutiques, whilst her more affordable Ginger Group line could be found in department stores throughout Scotland.Quant’s dressmaking patterns were sold by Butterick and Courtelle, empowering people to create their own piece of designer fashion using fabrics in colours and patterns of their own choice.Meredith More, VA Dundee curator, said: “We’d love to find out more about Mary Quant’s impact on those living in Dundee and Tayside and what her products and style meant to people.Two new exhibitions celebrating club culture and Mary Quant coming to VA Dundee\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp two-new-exhibitions-celebrating-club-culture-and-mary-quant-coming-to-va-dundee embed # secreteYnZMuIznH\" data-secret\"eYnZMuIznH\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“Perhaps you used the Butterick  pattern to make your very own Mary Quant Misses’ jacket  Maybe your Mum was a Quant fan and enjoyed knitting her Courtelle patterns #Or maybe you found a sewing pattern in a charity shop and have made your own unique piece recently “If you have a story about how Mary Quant has influenced your style please get in touch and let us know.”Anyone who has a Quant story or photograph to share is encouraged to get in touch with VA Dundee by emailing sewquant@vandadundee.org or by calling    between am and pm Monday to Friday.Please don’t post photographs or garments to the museum.The exhibition Mary Quant, which is currently on show at VA South Kensington, will run from April  # September  ."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45622255-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45622255-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45622255-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/10/2.45622255-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"win 100 with the teles fantastic strictly come dancing competition every friday","story":"Every Friday whilst Strictly Come Dancing is gracing our TVs the Tele is giving you the chance to cash in!Every Friday, each copy of the Eveningwill have the name of one of the dancers taking part on the show printed on the front page along with a Unique Reference Number.If your dancer is voted off on Sunday then you are in with a chance to win £!TO ENTER:Simply enter your dancer#s name and Unique Reference Number in the boxes below along with your contact details…that’s it!Good luck!Terms  Conditions:Entrants must register by midnight on Saturday, .

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The aim is to transfer all serious patients to one of these centres following pre-hospital emergency care within  minutes.The value of a helicopter air ambulance is therefore obvious.Working alongside the Scottish Ambulance Service#s air fleet, SCAA relies entirely on public donations to keep this vital resource flying.Please consider supporting SCAA in it#s le-saving work during a week when the country focuses on the crucial work of air ambulances everywhere.For further information please visit www.scaa.org.ukDavid Craig, chief executive, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance , Perth AirportSir,I get a magazine called #Clean Slate#.In it this month is an article where a -year-old girl, Greta Thunberg, along with  other youth activists, have issued this invitation to adults around the world: #Starting on Friday September  we are going to kick-start a week of climate action, with a world-wide strike for the climate.

At .pm on Saturday night a flock of Pink-footed Geese passed over my house from north to south, probably heading for the Solway or Lancashire.On the same day, a trip was made to the middle Teviot to look for Whooper Swans as two were reported earlier in the week and six noted at Dowlaw Dam near Cockburnspath.However, the trip produced nothing, so they may have moved on.On September  the local branch of the Scottish Ornithologistrsquos Club organised a field trip to St Abbrsquos Head. Several members met up at the main car park at the visitor centre and shared transport to the car park just near the lighthouse.The sun was out but a strong wind was encountered. The group set off to explore the west side of Mire Loch but found the wind too strong to make the birds show.Birds were present but keeping a low profile and the noise of the wind rustling the leaves did not help to locate birds by their calls. A Blue Tit appeared along with Wren and Dunnock. Several Chfchaff uttered their contact calls and a Goldcrest was seen briefly.On the Mire Loch a pair of Mute Swans protected three well-grown cygnets. Tucked into the reeds was a Little Grebe and as we walked down to the dam end several Moorhen called.Mallard, Tufted Duck and Coot were added to the site list.As the group moved slowly along the track several Speckled Wood butterflies sunned themselves. At the dam end at the edge of the willows there were about  Red Admirals. But no unusual migrant birds.The group headed up the path back towards the carpark, but again few birds. In the bay and on the clfs near the car park were a few Fulmars and a steady passage of Gannets. The odd Guillemot passed but no signicant movement on the sea. At the lighthouse a pair of House Martins were still catching insects for a late brood. The lighthouse walled garden had been receiving migrants but on the visit only two Robin made an appearance. Interesting, however, was the discovery of male and female Small Copper butterflies and seven Pinkfeet coming in off the sea.After lunch at the lighthouse garden, the party headed down to Burnmouth to examine the shore for waders. After scanning the foreshore Curlew, Redshank, Oystercatcher and Turnstone were found. Around the harbour were several Great Blacked Gulls, one of which carried a yellow colour ring, the details of which have been registered on the British Trust for Ornithologist online form for reporting ringed birds.At the moment the result has still to be received as regards where it was ringed. A Mute Swan was feeding in one of the rock pools and a Goosander was asleep at the edge of a pool. The only other birds of interest were a Rock Pipit and Peregrine.From Burnmouth some of the party headed inland to Foulden to view a small pond for wildfowl and waders. On the way down to the site from the village two Tree Sparrows and some Collared Dove were noted. On the pond we found a couple of Greylag but a few days previously there had been several hundred. Some  Pink-feet were present but before we left another  arrived. The pond was scanned thoroughly but no waders present, only four Pied Wagtails. A few Wigeon and Teal were added bringing the total for the three sites to .After the members had finished up for the day, the warden at St Abbrsquos reported on a short sea watch which he had undertaken later in the day. During our visit there was nothing unusual moving over the sea but the warden accounted for an adult Pomarine Skua, a Manx Shearwater and four Red-breasted Merganser. Then at .am the next day another birder had a Sabinersquos Gull with Kittiwakes and an Artic Skua. Then on September  a Mediterranean Gull appeared over the wardenrsquos cottage and there was a fly-past by a Grey Plover.These sightings had obviously aroused interest and a two-hour sea watch first thing on September  saw three Arctic Skua flying north,  Red-throated Divers, nine north, five south and  Common Scoter flying north.Less common migrants began to appear towards the end of the week with Lesser White Throat, Yellow-browed Warbler, Wood Warbler, Pied Flycatcher, Barred Warbler, Yellow Wagtail, Redstart and Black Redstart.In the following week Barnacle Geese passed over. This illustrates that birdwatching at this time of year can be exciting. An odd sighting was that of an Albatross species flying north but it looks as though no one  picked it up."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-set-turn-back-time-weekend-festivals","story":"SELKIRK is set to turn back time this weekend.The ever-popular Scotts Selkirk will take place for the th time throughout Saturday.And organisers have even added extra attractions by coinciding the Georgian celebrations with the toe-tapping Selkirk Sessions and the monthly Farmers Market.Viv Ross from Scotts Selkirk told us: \"Having started as a millennium project, this is the th time we have run the event.\"We would like to thank all our volunteers, performers and supporters who have helped us over the years to reach this milestone.\"The main streets in Selkirk will again be transformed into the days when Sir Walter dispensed justice from his courtroom.Period costumes are still available for hire from the events Market Place shop.As well as traditional entertainment, which includes puppeteers, dancers, musicians and performing animals, there will be an array of traditional childrens games on offer, such as splat-the-rat and a coconut shy.Fare from the th century will be served up at Meg Dods Kitchen, and Sir Walter willto the bench to deliberate over a couple of cases.Scotts Selkirk runs throughout Saturday, while the cream of local talent will take to stages in pubs and clubs around the town for the Selkirk Sessions from Friday evening through to Sunday.A car boot sale has also been organised for the Market Place on Sunday.Viv added: \"Our performers include GaelForce, Carlenjig, Riddell Fiddles, Bogie Close Stompers, Highline Fiddlers, and Bob Liddle.\"We are again really looking forward to the open mic sessions where we will no doubt be treated to some exceptional music.\"There will also be a host of talented buskers in both the Market Place and the High Street to add to the entertainment.\""},{"url":null,"title":"latest-new-childrens-park-opens-kelso","story":"THE latest new park in the Borders swung open at the weekend.And hundreds of children turned up to try out the latest equipment to be installed at Kelsos Shedden Park.Susan Glendinning, winner of the Ex-Kelso Laddies Letime Achievement Award, officially opened the facilities.The pound, play park is the sixth to be opened in the Borders in the last  months as part of a pound million investment in young peoples facilities.The new equipment installed at Kelso includes a swirl roundabout with seat and back support, built in trampoline, cradle seat swings and ious play  including a sign language .A central treetops towers unit also has an accessible ramp and wide slide to make it more accessible and inclusive to all abilities.Kelso Provost Dean Weatherston said: ldquoIt was great to be a part of a wonderful day and I enjoyed taking my daughter and nieces into the new park.ldquoIt is a great asset for the town and I am especially pleased there is equipment for children with disabilities.ldquoThank you to everyone who contributed to the project and those involved with the opening.Kelso, Galashiels, Stow, Oxton, Harestanes and Coldstream have so far received new play parks.And Peebles, Earlston, Duns, Eyemouth and Jedburgh are in line to also benefit over the next three years.Executive spokesman for neighbourhoods, councillor Sandy Aitchison told us: \"We have had some great feedback already on the new Shedden Park Play Park and we hope families in the local area will get along to try it out in the coming weeks.ldquoWe have plans for further play parks right across the Scottish Borders as well as new pump skate parks and fitness and youth shelters as part of the investment strategy, which is aiming to improve the right facilities in the right places."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-rachael-hamilton-msp","story":"Rachael Hamilton is Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and BerwickshireSuccess for MND Blue Badge CampaignLast week in the Scottish Parliament, it was very rewarding to see the Scottish Government finally decide to revise the Blue Badge eligibility criteria for people with MND.Several months ago, I joined forces with Doddie Weir OBE to start a campaign, which called on the Scottish Government to change the criteria for Blue Badges to ensure that people living with MND can gain automatic access.The campaign came about because of a constituent writing to me about their frustrations with the current system, and how the y process of applying for a Blue Badge is incompatible.Currently there is no cure or effective treatment for MND, and the average le expectancy after diagnosis is sadly  months.

After some detailed discussion it was agreed that these affected areas would continue to be mown regularly to maintain the appearance of the park, said Mr Turnbull.But the community council agreed that bioersity could be increased in an area of Haylodge that would not detract from the amenity of open spaces.Mr Turnbull explained: ldquoA suggestion was made that a flat piece of parkland at the extreme western end of the park could be converted into a community orchard where fruit trees that thrive in our climate could be planted, this could include ieties of apple, pears and plums and such like.ldquoIt is reassuring to see that managers in SBC recognise the validity of the communityrsquos concerns and have agreed not to make any changes, as proposed, in the way these areas are currently managed. The suggestion for a community orchard at the western end of the park is, in my view, a good one. Such an orchard would be on a piece of land that doesnt seem to be used very much and it would add a great deal of interest to the park as well as providing fruit for the community."},{"url":null,"title":"gala-stylists-pick-pace-lavender-touch","story":"GALASHIELS hairdressers Sharon Sanderson and William Pearson proved to be a cut above last month as they completed the gruelling Edinburgh Half Marathon.The R and R Hair and Beauty salon stylists spent several months pounding the streets of Gala in training.Their efforts proved worthwhile as both -year-old William and -year-old Sharon reached the finishing line well within their two hour targets.And, so far, they have also raised more than pound for local cancer charity, The Lavender Touch.William told us: \"Both Sharon and I have had people in our lives who have been affected by cancer.\"Ive done Gala Opera for a number of years and got to know our photographer Shiela Scott and the great work that she and Lavender Touch do to help people in the Borders with cancer.\"It was Sharons idea to do the Edinburgh Half Marathon to help the charity and we trained together to get ready for it.\"Weve been overwhelmed by the amount of support weve received, both in the shop and also online.\"Sharon completed the coastal route from Meadowmill to Musselburgh in a time of . while William was a couple of minutes further back with ..Sharon added: \"Lavender Touch provide such a crucial support to iniduals and families going through an extremely dficult time in their le.\"Every single penny makes a huge dference to the lives affected by this horrible disease.\"To support William and Sharon visit their crowdfunding page at www.justgiving crowdfunding stuart-mcdonald-"},{"url":null,"title":"letter independence march","story":"I didn#t march because my aged legs don#t carry me far these days, but I#m not ashamed to be a supporter of independence.

Assisted by Scott Souden’s low cross from the left flank, the substitute striker guided a delightful flick into the net beyond the Glynhill keeper. Taking on the role of target-man with gusto, Radecki played a big part in the Feathers-sponsored Pupils’ fourth goal, when he held off a defender down the right wing and crossed to substitute Calum McKillop, whose back-heel flick found Souden at the penalty spot, and the -year-old winger, making the journey home from Edinburgh for a game, passed the ball into the net with ease to complete the scoring.The game became a procession in the closing minutes with man-of-the-match Crossan, the midfield linchpin alongside the impressive Liam Renton, orchestrating some controlled possession football, but there was some trouble on  minutes when a malicious foul on ex-Dumbarton man D McCallum sparked into a melee with players from both sides involved. It resulted in a second booking for Kenny Kerr, a yellow for J McCallum, and a red card for the original Glynhill culprit, as well as yellow for the visiting keeper from referee Jimmy Litster, after charging from his own goalmouth to become involved.Undeterred, the Pupils settled back down to seal a richly deserved victory,achieved through a disciplined and determined performance.The Kintyre Park side will now enjoy a free week, with ato action scheduled for Saturday October , opponent to be confirmed.For fixture updates, and to see second-half action and goals from last Saturday’s match, see Campbeltown Football on Facebook, or @PupilsAFC on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"weather wont play fair for men","story":"Strong winds, for most of the players, deflected several balls into the severe rough and out of bounds and pushed scores upwards.Robert Shaw, one of the first out in the morning ballot, had an excellent round to finish on a nett  from Ken MacMillan on nett .The wind continued in the afternoon but didn#t deter John Docherty from the best scratch score of the day.

However, it was the home side that took the lead on the nd minute when Ashfield’s centre forward cut in from the left before sending an unstoppable shot in to the top corner.A test of character was required from the boys as they fell behind and with five minutes of the half remaining they were rewarded after a corner dropped to Stuart Phillps in the box. The young forward adjusted his feet quickly to send a beautul curling shot past everyone to make it -.Fteen minutes into the second half the Pupils took the lead. New signing Raphael MacLachlan, playing in only his second appearance for the s, sent in a delightful whipped corner that brushed off the Ashfield centre-half into the goal to make it -. The Clachan youngster can be proud of his impact on the game and is already proving to be a valuable addition to the team.As the Pupils pressed for their third of the game a long ball evaded the defence to allow the Ashfield number  in again to equalise with  minutes remaining.As the game drew to a close, it looked like both sides would share the points until a dramatic final minute. A long clearance by Ashfield was misjudged by the Pupils defence to allow Ashfield’s player in with a chance of his hat-trick but the youngster scuffed his shot into thankful hands of Pupils goal-keeper Lorne Paterson.Knowing it was the final minute, Paterson tried to kick the ball up the field as quickly as possible only for it to cannon off the back of Euan O’May’s head! It landed back in Paterson’s hands and he quickly dispersed the ball, long up the field where the ball bounced high over everyone, only for Calum Ellis to nip in front of the Ashfield centre-half, run in on goal, calmly round the advancing goal-keeper and stroke the ball home to make it - to the Ardshield Hotel-sponsored side – much to the delight of his fellow team mates and coaches.Ellis who has now scored seven goals in the Under s# opening four games.This weekend the team will enjoy a free fixture due before playing at home to Glasgow Boys Club on Sunday October ."},{"url":null,"title":"mcfadyens amam a tremendous days golf","story":"It was one of sponsor McFadyen Contractors Ltd#s own teams that won the trophy with a tremendous score of  # a mighty  under par.

He was in Scotland mainly to play golf and try whisky, he told me. I was trying to convince him Scotland had many other things to offer and we got onto the issue of Scotlandrsquos landscape. He seemed interested in how our land was used, and he told me that back home he owned a ranch, which included a medium-sized forest of native trees.I remember saying ldquowow, thatrsquos so special, but he shook his head, saying: ldquoSpecial  No, not really, a stupid law means the forest is worthless.I was a bit confused, so I asked him what he meant. ldquoTherersquos a preservation order on it, which means that part of my land is unproductive, he said.I realised at this point that although we were having the same conversation about land, we were having dferent understandings of it.He shook his head sadly and said: ldquoItrsquos just a waste of good timber.That kind of ended our conversation. I didnrsquot try to persuade him to think dferently, I felt that I wasnrsquot in a position to do that since he was a paying customer and my tip could have been at stake.That conversation was nearly  years ago. And yet his comment ldquoitrsquos just a waste of good timber has stuck with me ever since. The reason for this was the mindset it revealed. I found it depressing that he could not see the value of something so precious because it would make him no financial profit.As my kids get geared up for the school climate strike this week, I realise now this mindset is one which has to be challenged. When I look back, I am ashamed of myself that I did not have the courage to speak out to the man, simply because I needed his tip.There are many parts of the climate crisis, but one truth within the debate is trees are our le. I have seen one calculation that each human breathes in the oxygen produced by around eight trees. So count the number in your family and those you love and multiply by eight. That is the number of trees needed to help your family and loved ones breathe. For sure, trees arenrsquot the only source of the oxygen we breathe, but they are a signicant part of it, and they hold tons of carbon. Surely that alone is lsquoprofitrsquo enough.But while the riches of woodland go way beyond that of timber profit, I understand that environmental destruction is linked to poverty as well as greed. We need to challenge both. But we will never do thiswe are made to be too afraid to speak out, either because we fear those who wield financial power over us, or the ridicule of others who as yet donrsquot get it.In a storytelling session last week for a P class in an East Lothian primary school, I told the tale of the king who wanted to touch the moon. He always gets his way because people are afraid of him, so the forest in his kingdom is cut down to make a tower of wooden boxes to the moon. But he is impatient and foolish, and falls from the tower, and the boxes all get smashed. The forest has been destroyed for the kingrsquos failed vanity project, while his people remain poor and still afraid of him.One of the girls in the class put her hand up then said: ldquoBut we need trees to live. Later she told me: ldquoThey should get rid of the kinghe doesnrsquot change his bad ways.Many of our young people get it. Itrsquos their future. We can all make our own small personal contribution, but to save our childrenrsquos future, courage is needed to speak out, for adults too.Never again will I remain silent, for either reward or fear of ridicule. There is too much at stake, not just for me but for my children and this dear planet which is home for us all, but dying in our care."},{"url":null,"title":"haddington-parking-plans-discussion-held-private","story":"East Lothian Council is working on designs that would see the parking provision changed in the town, including the possibility of a -plus-space long-stay car park on the townrsquos Whittingehame Drive.However, town centre traders are concerned about the possibility of spaces being lost on High Street and Market Street, with it also being mooted that the long-stay car park at Tesco, which is used by many people working in the town centre, could become short-stay only.The issue was briefly mentioned at the townrsquos community council meeting last Tuesday evening.Usually, these meetings are open to the public and the press however, it was agreed to cut short next monthrsquos meeting to allow community councillors to discuss the controversial plans in private.Jan Wilson, the grouprsquos long-standing chairwoman, said: ldquoIrsquom not sure how much can be made public at the moment.ldquoI know community council meetings should be public but there are times when I have to say no because the proposals are not set in stone yet.

What exactly fostered it I cannot say, but for sure the stories of lsquoMadam Butterflyrsquo, a teacher at Preston Lodge, was part of it, and perhaps also the history that I was visibly surrounded by when I left Prestonpans and moved to Edinburghrsquos Old Town as a teenager.What I do remember from these times is a powerful feeling that I was lucky to have this interest. It kept me going when I was having bad times, because there was always something that interested me or stimulated my fascination.I have realised now that part of historyrsquos appeal is the images it creates for us, of a time that is dferent to ours. No matter how many lsquofactsrsquo there may be, itrsquos our imaginative interpretation of them which makes this information interesting or fascinating.This is why archaeology can also be particularly interesting. Itrsquos a tantalising glimpse into the past but leaves lots of scope for our own imaginative recreations. This connects to the fact that we often hold fascination for things we have lost because we cannot physically experience them anymore.For me, this is the case every time I travel through the Hardgate in Haddington. Until the s, a building stood on the east side of the street, where now there is a small grassy park. Locals nicknamed the building Bothwell Castle, although it wasnrsquot a castle in the real sense, but an impressive town house owned by the Cockburns of Sandybed, hence its original name, Sandybed House. Old photos of it show it in a rundown condition even a hundred years ago, but still looking magnicent.Nobody now will remember what it looked like inside before its dilapidated state. A drawing of the interior from the s shows it had wooden ling, described as ldquoexcellent examples of native craftsmanship.The most prominent feature from the street was perhaps the circular stair tower, which also had the original entrance. It was this feature that made the building look like a castle, I reckon. Inside there was a sunken floor, two upper floors and an attic. It enclosed a courtyard and the building ran eastwards to the banks of the River Tyne.There is a scarcity of historical information about this building, which was demolished to widen the road, after ious attempts to save it failed.But there is at least one story which lights my imagination whenever I am standing in the small green park where Bothwell Castle once stood.It involves the notorious James Hepburn, th Earl of Bothwell, the man who murdered Mary Queen of Scotsrsquo husband Darnley and then married her himself, after seemingly abducting her.But the story takes place before all this, during the time when Maryrsquos mother, Mary of Guise, was fighting the Protestant Lords of the Congregation. Despite being a Protestant, Bothwell was on the side of the Catholic queen. He was young but one of the most powerful nobles in the land.In , Bothwell received information that a huge sum of money was being sent by an English nobleman called Sir Ralph Sadler to help the Lords of the Congregation. He lay in wait and attacked the carrier of the money, both robbing and wounding him.This act enraged the leaders of the Protestant cause and some time afterwards the leaders, the Earl of Arran and Lord James Stewart, headed for Haddington to capture Bothwell.The house he was staying in was close to the River Tyne. But he saw the soldiers approaching just in time and fled. He got to the river and waded along its banks until he reached Sandybed House.He knew he had likely been spotted and his pursuers were hot on his heels. So he entered Sandybed House by the back door. He could hear the shouts from the soldiers outside and knew he had little time to hide, but where He ran into the kitchen, where a spit boy sat turning the spit. There was not a moment to lose.ldquoQuick, gie me yer claes tae wear, Bothwell commanded. The young lad, unable to refuse an order from such a powerful noble, immediately obeyed. Bothwell, being a slim young man himself, was just able to slip them on.Then Bothwell sat by the fire and began to turn the spit, pretending to be the spit boy, whom he commanded to leave and to take his clothes. We have no account of the moment the soldiers entered the kitchen. It will have been a tense one. Bothwell will have felt the heat, both of fear and of the fire on his face and hands just a small and very short taste of the harsh le of a spit boy.The soldiers did not recognise that the spit boy was actually Bothwell sitting in disguise in the half dark flickering light of the kitchen. Servants with such a lowly status were barely even noticed anyway by the noble class. They were almost like part of the furniture to them.There is a story that he then fled to his castle at Hailes dressed as a woman. It is said he later rewarded Cockburn of Sandybed for not giving him away, but one wondersthe spit boy was also rewarded.I suspect not. However, I like to think he was somehow able to keep Bothwellrsquos clothes, and I wonderthe woman got hers back.No doubt the spit boy often told his story as he turned the spit, cooking it as much as the meat.Sadly, the kitchen where this took place has gone now, of course. But is it In , a community archaeology project was undertaken, part funded by the Peter Potter Gallery Monument project. Archaeologist David Connolly explains in a fascinating YouTube clip that the dig revealed parts of Bothwell Castle. He shows that the lintel above the door into the kitchen lies just under the ground. In fact, the remains of the kitchen are just part of a mass of archaeological finds in the Hardgate, going back to Medieval times.These finds are covered up now, butyou venture yourself to the wee park in the Hardgate you can still see the disturbed ground where they took place.And look closely at the wall by the road, next to the southern entrance. There is a strange curve in the wall here. Thatrsquos because the lower section of this part of the wall is in fact the remains of the circular stair tower of Bothwell Castle.A buddleia butterfly bush was growing by it when I visited last week, but my long-suffering family waited as I ventured under the bush to take a photo of what I believe to be the old stonework of the stair tower.I then told them the story of the spit boy as we sat on the location of the kitchen. The river is just beyond and as we left the park I couldnrsquot get an image of Bothwell dressed as a washer woman out of my head.As I say, history can be fascinating because it stimulates our imaginative interpretation!"},{"url":null,"title":"pipers-become-movie-stars-bands-unusual-new-calendar","story":"Haddington Pipe Band launches its  calendar this weekend, with this yearrsquos taking on a movie theme.The launch is at the townrsquos The Loft Cafe today , where the  shots that were taken for the calendar by photographer Paul Bock will be on show until January.Alastair Bruce, from Haddington Pipe Band, said: ldquoWe decided on a slightly dferent approach this time round and wersquove certainly had a lot of fun putting these shots together.ldquoOur inspiration was iconic film posters so, working with Paul, we have recreated and re-interpreted  well-known posters and given them all a piping and drumming twist, with band members taking the starring roles.ldquoWersquove also put a spin on the titles and the other text which featured on the originals.The group are recreating posters from popular movies including Braveheart, Trainspotting, Harry Potter, Chariots of Fire, The Sound of Music and Pirates of the Caribbean.Alastair added: ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to pay tribute to Paul Bock, who has done an absolutely fantastic job with the shots his creativity was unbelievable.ldquoAimee Colley of Shaw Marketing and Design also did a terric job creating the artwork and Lori Walker was a huge help in turning band members into film stars with her make-up skills.ldquoOf course, the real stars are the band members themselves!ldquoWe are also extremely grateful to the many businesses and organisations who have kindly sponsored the production.

In addition, through making these positive changes, Riverside has been able to provide more and longer advance bookable GP appointments.ldquoRiverside is growing our team of GPs and has successfully recruited seven new GPs over the last two years.ldquoThe practice is currently going through a period of signicant telephone and clinical systems upgrades that will not only address the limitations patients at the Riverside practice have experienced but will introduce a new low-charge  number.ldquoOnce complete, the upgrades, in line with the new way of working, will provide long-term benefits for all patients in the area.

Guy Madgwick, CEO of Red Rock Power, which owns Inch Cape, said:ldquoWe are naturally very disappointed that our Inch Cape Offshore Wind Farm project has not secured a CfD award.ldquoThe development is a culmination of over  years of hard work and signicant investment and could play an important role in both achieving the countryrsquos green energy targets and supporting economic growth.ldquoWe will now liaise closely with our supply chain to consider how best to move forward with the project, and hope to share an update as soon as possible.Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, which is pushing for a ferry and cruise terminal to be investigated for the site, said the decision raised questions about Scottish Ministersrsquo decision to call in the application.He said: ldquoThis is a very worrying announcement and puts a large question mark overRed Rockrsquos planned substation at Preston Links.ldquoAt the planning enquiry last year, Red Rock placed considerable emphasis on securing a funding subsidy from the UK Government and this decision also brings into question the wisdom of the Scottish Government calling in their planning application and bypassing the local democratic planning process.East Lothian Council said it had held talks with ICOL regarding the site following the announcement and further meetings would be arranged.A spokesperson said: ldquoWe understand [Inch Cape] are considering all options to allow the project to progress.ldquoWe will hold a meeting with them in the near future to discuss a way forward."},{"url":null,"title":"charity-embezzlers-sentence-deferred-tries-sell-faside-castle","story":"Ian Brash, , stole more than pound, from the student charity the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust while he was a trustee of the organisation.He pleaded guilty to the offence at a court hearing last year and is awaiting sentencing.The hold-up in the case has been Brashrsquos inability to sell the listed castle on the outskirts of Tranent so he can pay the charity back before sentence is passed.But last Friday, Edinburgh Sherf Court was told that the sale of the castle, currently on the market for offers over pound.m, had still not materialised.Sherf Frank Crowe was also told that the forensic accountant employed by the Crown to go through all Brashrsquos finances had taken ill and would need replaced.Sherf Crowe allowed the Crown motion to further defer sentence to allow them more time to delve into Brashrsquos finances.The case will now call again for sentencing on November .Brash pleaded guilty last year to embezzling pound, from the Dr Robert Malcolm Trust charity between August , , and September , .The father-of-two is currently selling the historic Category A-Listed Farsquoside Castle, a th-century four-storey castle with six bedrooms, four reception rooms and a great hall, through a leading Edinburgh estate agent for offers over pound. million."},{"url":null,"title":"long-awaited-port-seton-sports-hall-works-last","story":"The new facility will be part of the Port Seton Centre on the area currently used as the childrenrsquos play area it will allow the community hub to offer a wider array of activities, including indoor basketball, badminton, tennis, football and gymnastics.Some of the existing outdoor play equipment is being removed from the area to facilitate the building works, though this will be relocated to a new play area where within the park, along with the installation of some new play equipment.Tom Reid, head of infrastructure with East Lothian Council, said: ldquoWe are all very excited about the construction of the new sports hall, which will be an excellent new facility for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton, complementing existing activity areas within the Port Seton Centre.ldquoWe do appreciate that there will need to be an element of disruption associated with the construction work, particularly as the new extension requires to be sited where the current childrenrsquos play park is located.ldquoWe expect to relocate elements of the existing play equipment where possible to the new area and this will be installed to coincide with the arrival of other play equipment in the coming months.ldquoWe recognise this means that there will be a temporary reduction in the amount of play equipment available within the park and we are grateful for the patience and understanding of park users at this time.

After  months, wersquove barely reached base camp, yet we canrsquot give up now. The gardens hereabouts are a constant reminder of how much there is to learn. Some of them are as lovely as Sissinghurst or Inverewe, and quite obviously require as much hard work. As a result, when neighbours meet, conversation is more likely to turn to brassicas and box blight than Brexit and the Backstop. Also high on the agenda are butterflies and bees, the absence or superabundance of rain, heat surges, the proleration of wasps, and the effect of all the above on the quality of their compost. If you chance to look up at the sky, someone will guess, to within a degree of accuracy, what the next dayrsquos temperature will be.This must be because, like gardeners everywhere, they are acutely attuned to the weather. Other than farmers, I doubt there is any single group more intensely aware of our climate, and the ways in which it is fast changing. For some of them, the young Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg is like Joan of Arc, fearlessly confronting the forces of destruction, and inspiring all of us to be more vocal, angry and proactive. If you have a garden, you cannot be unaware that when she says ldquochange is coming, whether you like it or not, itrsquos not a prediction for the far future. Change is already here. Indeed, serious gardeners are already taking steps, tree by tree, shrub by shrub, to mitigate or adapt to its impact.This became particularly evident last weekend at a Gardenerrsquos Question Time, run by Borders Organic Gardeners, in St Boswellrsquos village hall. The room was packed with people so experienced they cast Monty Don into the shade. A  of three experts, including this paperrsquos gardening columnist Dave Allan, held their nerve for almost two hours to answer a barrage of questions that ranged from how to deal with snails and slugs , and the best apple trees for a cold spot .Opinion ied on what tree to plant to replace a dying ash, but in answering, the alpine expert Ron McBeath said that all our ash trees will probably be gone within ten years. There would even be spores carrying ash dieback in the village hall where we sat, he told us, making a few of us shuffle our boots. It was an uncomfortable reminder that certain forces are beyond control, some bad situations irreversible. Other, thankfully less devastating, diseases were mentioned, heading northwards in our direction on the warming thermal tide. Above all, as Emma Emmerson, of Woodside Plant Centre near Ancrum remarked, everyone is noticing the ldquocollapsed seasons, and the challenges they present to making a garden grow as it did in the past.Concern in the hall was palpable. Gardeners are in the frontline of climate change, seeing in miniature what is happening in the world at large. The  discussion ranged over what we could do to help wildle and especially birds to thrive ndash cat lovers should lock up their pets ndash but in terms of plants, it would seem that we are approaching uncharted territory. Old certainties are no longer reliable.Sombre though it sounds, it was not an afternoon of gloom ndash quite the reverse. For a start it was a reminder of how much fun it is to grow things and, in the case of vegetables and fruits, to watch them ripen, before falling upon them with kne, fork and spoon. It was also an encouragement, for beginners like me, to get more serious. To learn that, across the UK, more land is covered by gardens than by nature reserves is to understand the humble back yard or allotmentrsquos place in a giant living patchwork. Each of these plots, and not just those abiding by organic principles, stands guard on the ramparts, defending the gate against attack.This mild month, with bees still nose-deep in our flower beds, and hedges quivering with sparrows, finches and tits with owls keeping us awake from the horse chestnut tree outside the window, hedgehogs rootling in the field we call our lawn, and a young woodpecker learning his trade on the telegraph pole by our fence, it becomes abundantly clear that the place you like to think of as your own is in fact shared with thousands of other creatures.That will not be news to those who have gone out of their way to help feed the birds. A recent survey showed that in Britain enough food is served to sustain  million birds every year. Species that were struggling  years ago are now making a comeback, among them goldfinches and nuthatches.Itrsquos a glimmer of hope amid the increasingly apocalyptic language around climate change. As the villagersquos green-fingered army shows, there is nothing egotistical or self-centred about people devoted to the upkeep of their borders and trellises, their fruit trees and raised beds. When Voltaire wrote, ldquoit is our duty to cultivate our garden he was not, for once, being sarcastic. A passionate gardener who, as he grew older, craved the simple le, he understood the deeper meaning to be found in tending your own patch. The upkeep of that little bit of earth results in spiritual well-being as well as a barrowload of juicy carrots. Those of us cheering on crusaders like Thunberg can still raise our own battle standard. It should be planted carefully between the raspberry canes or beside a clematis or, in our case, among the rampant, bee-friendly weeds."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10459949.jpg?type=article-full","title":"guide-scotlands-best-seafood-experiences","story":"The Seafood Ristorante, St AndrewsLocated in an iconic lsquoglass boxrsquo, the Seafood Ristorante relaunched in March  and isnow one of Scotlandrsquos premium dining venues.

He denies it, of course. But for advocates of the personal is political, his casual conduct is of immense signicance.Similarly, language and the PMs use of military metaphors betray personal traits that are politically signicant. His resort to words like ldquohumbug and ldquoSurrender Act are supposedly windows into the corrupt soul of a misogynistic micro-fascist. I hereby claim , by the way, on the term ldquomicro-fascist, which is an extension of the idea of ldquomicro-aggressions, so popular on university campuses among people who believe tiny things matter a lot.But do they  The media is obsessed with language right now, and personal conduct, possibly because many of its practitioners grew up with the personal is political phrase ringing in their ears. Twitter cant get enough of this stuff, though its no slouch itself when it comes to aggressive language. ldquoRacist, Liar. Misogynist. Mendacious, philandering scumbag! were some of the more temperate reactions on social media to Boris Johnsons recent round of BBC interviews.But judging from the PMs relaxed and unruffled demeanour on Marr and the Today programme, hes not that bothered. His political advisers believe that most people are, rightly or wrongly, supremely indferent to the question of where the PMs hand strayed  years ago. And the preoccupation with language they find almost comical. People use military metaphors all the time, like ldquostick to your guns. Doesnt mean they want to kill you with cannons.Indeed,military metaphors are to be regarded as incitements to violence, then Sir John Curtice had better watch out when he next talks of the general election ldquocampaign being a ldquobattleground with ldquotarget seats, an ldquoair war and a ldquodecapitation strategy. Boris Johnson just makes jokes about all this synthetic outrage. Why  Because the politics of the PMs personal le and language plays well in the echo-chambers of Twitter, but not in focus groups, where people are bothered about pay, jobs, the NHS and Brexit, Brexit, Brexit.Im not so sure. Torsten Bell, of the low pay think tank the Resolution Foundation, takes it seriously and hailed it as ldquohugely ambitious. Sajid Javid says he is adopting their policy of a living wage set at % median earnings, to eliminate poverty pay in a decade.Now, they may not mean it. But it seems to me something pretty fundamental is going on undergrowth of British politicsthe Conservatives are even talking this way. The centre-ground has moved dramatically and suddenly to the left.Im not saying the PM has become a Marxist, but its striking that he has started to use the language of Keynesian economics. It is rare enough to hear a Tory advocate higher public spending. But Johnson is now echoing Labours argument that low interest rates are a unique opportunity for governments to make massive investments in infrastructure, new hospitals, gigabit broad-band etc.When did you last hear a Tory PM make the case for what is sometimes called ldquoPeoples Quantitative Easing  Margaret Thatcher would be appalled at this abandonment of fiscal prudence and Javids talk of the Tories being a ldquoworkers party. Even Tony Blair regarded redistribution and deficit financing as ldquoold Labour.Of course, a lot of what the PM says is probably electioneering: offering jam tomorrow and bagels after Brexit. But it also marks a big sht in the electoral ldquobattlegroundIm still allowed to use that term. Its a tribute to the work of parties like Labour and the SNP who have rehabilitated social democratic policies after three decades in the wilderness.Indeed, the Scottish National Partys policies, on the ldquosocial wage, borrowing and taxation, are beginning to look distinctly conservative, with a small ldquoc. Jeremy Corbyns policies on nationalisation, public spending, Universal Basic Services etc. no longer seem so extreme.The great moving left show is taking us into very interesting political territory, where many of the dogmas of the neoliberal era, which began with Margaret Thatchers monetarist experiments, are falling way. Im not sure where Brexit fits into all this, but it has clearly been a catalyst. Pressure from the ldquoleft behinds in provincial England has provoked a fracturing in the ideology of the right.People are fed up with austerity, low wages, crumbing infrastructure. They want big changes, not just in the way politicians talk, but what they actually do. I cant remember a time quite like this. Andthe Tories are actually talking left, I want to hear more of it. I want interviewers to interrogate the PM about these policies, and not just thigh-gate because we need to know just how seriously to take this new language.The personal may of of huge signicance to some people, but we should never forget that the political is political too, and thats important for all of us."},{"url":null,"title":"helen-mcardle-latest-red-meat-study-not-used-claim-moral-high-ground","story":"A recent surge in veganism driven less by animal rights than climate change consciousness and perceived health benefits has helped to polarise attitudes to red and processed meats, and given licence to people who want to police what other people consume.It is in this context then that we have to understand some of the emotionally-driven reactions to a study this week which declared that, actually, the evidence for its harm to health was \"weak\" and there was little point in cutting down.The scientists, publishing their findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine, reviewed the existing data and concluded that - for most people - eating less red and processed meat was associated with only a \"very small reduction\" in cancer risk.: Trumps fast action on US vaping panic is misguidedEven then, the basis for this conclusion was of \"low certainty\" - in other words, it is not even clear whether there is a real causal effect at all.It seems unlikely that the study will sway eating habits one way or the other. But the findings fired up the Twittersphere as the meat promoters claimed vindication and pro-Atkins gurus said this was yet more proof that all our problems are down to sugar and carbs anyway.Meanwhile, plant-based advocate Walter Willett, a US professor of epidemiology and nutrition, dubbed the research an \"egregious abuse of evidence\", and the World Cancer Research Fund said it would not alter its recommendations to limit red meat intake.Professor Giles Yeo, a Cambridge University geneticist and obesity researcher, noted that the risk perception changed whether you looked at the findings on an inidual or population level.For example, the study suggests that, people cut out three portions of red or processed meat every week for their letime, there would be seven fewer deaths from cancer, of any type.Most people might take their chances and consider that the likelihood of them being one of those lucky seven are pretty small.At a population level, however, that is  fewer cases of cancer for every million people. As Prof Yeo pointed out, thats not exactly trivial.: Public inquiries can give answers - but not always the answers people wantFurthermore, a major study in January said the only sustainable diet for the planet would be plant-based, and humanity would have to halve its red meat and sugar intake by .But does this give people a right to moralise about meat Maybe yes, but it the problem is it is counter-productive: brow-beating and lecturing will only entrench habits, not change them.A more plant-based diet is almost certainly the direction of travel.

Scotland is now the th nation to do so.Wales is close to ushering through its own ban, but there are currently no plans for a similar move in England or Northern Ireland.Scotlands Childrens Commissioner Bruce Adamson welcomed yesterdays decision.He said: \"Assaulting a child for the purpose of punishment should never be legal and this important law change brings Scotland into line with its international human rights commitment to provide children with comprehensive legal protection from violence.\"Martin Crewe, director of Barnardos Scotland, described it as \"a momentous day for childrens rights\".He thanked Mr Finnie for his \"dedication and passion\" in pushing the Bill forward, and said: \"We look forward to seeing similar legislation passed in the Welsh Assembly and hope that this progress can be mirrored across the other nations of the UK too.\"Mary Glasgow, chief executive of the charity Children st, said: \"This is a defining moment for Scotland.\"Again and again people have told us about the lelong impact of being hit as a child, as theyve joined the campaign to change the law.\"Todays vote protects every future generation of Scotlands children from any and all levels of physical violence.

I support the PM in everything he is doing andwe canrsquot get a deal by October  - and I hope we can - itrsquos time for us to go.The sht, made without consulting all his MSPs, left some in a ldquocold fury.At FMQs, Mr Carlaw said his party was ready to support the Prime Ministerrsquos proposed deal, and asked Ms Sturgeon why her MPs were automatically opposed to it, when she said she was ready to compromise.He said: ldquoFurther dither, delay and uncertainty, and the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn as Prime Minister, to which this First Minister is disgracefully open, is much more damaging to us all than getting this sorted now.ldquoWe are at the th hour, there is a need on all sides to compromisewe are going to reach a negotiated settlement, yet the record of this SNP Government has been to fail to do so. ldquoThe First Minister repeatedly says she will do anything possible to stop no-deal, yet despite three opportunities this year, her MPs havenrsquot ever voted for a deal.ldquoDoes she regret not ordering her MPs to vote for a deal when she had the chance The FM replied: ldquoMy alternative to no-deal is no Brexit, thatrsquos what the people of Scotland voted for. All of the efforts at compromise to keep us in the single market and customs union were spurned and cast aside by Theresa May.

Irsquom not even sure he cares about the best interests of the Scottish Conservative Party, because backing no-deal is certainly not in those interests.ldquoI think Jackson Carlaw has made the miscalculation that backing Boris Johnson is the best way to remain leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, but I have to say, his colleagues seem to have a completely dferent view of that.ldquoJackson Carlaw has squandered any shred of credibility he ever had.Mr Carlaw said Ms Sturgeon was not interested in an orderly UK exit from the EU, merely a ldquoneverendum on Brexit, much like the one she pursues on independence.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard raised concerns about NHS Tayside wanting to centralise mental health services despite an independent expert recommending it should not.Mr Leonard said Dr David Strangrsquos interim report had one recommendation - no centralisation before a full review of mental health service strategy - yet the health board was proposing to ignore it.Dr Strangrsquos report was prompted by a campaign by relatives of David Ramsay, who killed himself in  after twice being turned away from the Carseview Centre in Dundee.Mr Leonard quoted Dr Strangrsquos reaction to the health boardrsquos plan: ldquoIt is disappointing. This was the only recommendation in the whole report, because I thought it was urgently needed.Mr Leonard also quoted Mr Ramsayrsquos niece, Gillian Murray, who led the campaign after his death: ldquoNHS Tayside refuse to listen, they refuse to change, they are being allowed to carry on: business as usual ... things are getting worse at NHS Tayside, not better.He asked Ms Sturgeon to intervene ldquobefore more time is wasted, before more families are made to suffer and before more lives are needlessly lost.She said: ldquoI expect health boards to properly take account of such recommendations in the decision-making processes that they are required to undertake. I will certainly consider carefully the points that Richard Leonard has made.ldquoI take the opportunity, again, to put on record my condolences to David Ramsayrsquos family and to anyone  whose loved one has lost their le to suicide.ldquoThe Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport would be very willing to meet David Ramsayrsquos family,that would be of interest, to hear at first hand their concerns about the ongoing situation at NHS Tayside.ldquoIt is important that we listen to the lived experience of patients and patientsrsquo relatives, and we will continue to do that in good faith and in all sincerity."},{"url":null,"title":"priti-patels-australian-immigration-system-diversion-tory-mistakes","story":"Hooh-rah, clapped the Tory faithful as Ms Patel promised to make it that much harder for their children to take a European gap yah, for them to enjoy a second home in Tuscany and for the partys young to spend long weekends in Marbella.Ending British citizens automatic rights to live, work, study or retire in any of  EU countries might at least be met with muted pleasure.

Cant do thatyoure unemployed.It was faintly amusing,you like your amusement with a side order of alarm, that Ms Patels announcement that Britain will make its borders more hostile came as Saudi Arabia announced plans to make the country more welcoming to foreigners with the introduction of tourist visas.At the anniversary of the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi government staff, when homosexuality is still punishable by death and when women suffer under severe restrictions of their rights, appearing less welcoming to outsiders than Saudi Arabia is certainly a look. Not a good one.Tourists looking to take the Kingdom up on its offer will have to balance shining a light on injustices thriving under isolation with giving money to a government that will use it for nefarious purposes.Back to Ms Patel who, at least, is consistent, having first called for an Australian-style points based system three years ago. Her pledge now to press on with such a system - and we dont know how it will look as we are several months away from a Migration Advisory Committee review of how the system would work - stands in contrast to last Decembers more liberal white paper on immigration from Sajid Javid.Promising an Australian-style system indicates new government plans will be harsher than those announced under a year ago.\"Australian-style\" seems to have become synonymous with \"hard-line\" for politicians looking to appease voters on the topic of immigration. Donald Trump, as another example, also pledged an Australian-style points based system to his electorate to tighten up Americas borders.People have the impression of the Australian system as being tough. This has perhaps become increasingly the case because of its stance on asylum seekers - the horric conditions imposed on refugees in the now closed Nauru and Manus Island offshore processing camps, part of the defunct Pacic Solution.The notion aping Australia will clamp down on migration is an interesting take given that the Australian system was designed to increase levels of immigration to the country. Scaled up, it would have the effect of allowing in far more new residents to the UK than our current systems.So, what Ms Patel is pledging is to end freedom of movement yet introduce an immigration system that invites a high level of migrants to the country. The dference being, of course, that it will allow in the \"right sort\" of migrants, the \"best and brightest\".Out of interest, I totted up my points and wouldnt have enough to be welcome in Australia. Bit of a bummer to reduce your social and economic worth to hard figures and find out one is not the best or brightest.One of the criticisms of the Australian system is that it is too white. A focus on English proficiency prioritises those from countries where English is a first language, unlike the Canadian system which is also points based but encourages multi-culturalism.Another of the oft-discussed elements of the Australian system is that it allows people to migrate without first having work, an element that has its pluses - people are not tied to one employer, say, and can move jobs more easily - but also its downsides, in that new residents do not always find employment.Australia is now increasingly moving away from this system, allowing employers to offer visas to skilled migrants as well as using its points system.Reducing immigration and ending free movement will harm the UK economy and our society, particularly the NHS and universities. Weve heard enough about the benefits migrants bring to the country to know this. Yet there seems a real lack of meaningful discussion about migration, only hard-line promises to drastically reduce immigration or complaints that politicians have broken their promises.It seems to be overlooked that while people come in, people also go out. Ending free movement is an act of self-harm based on unfounded suspicion of migrants stoked by an aggressively isive political class. There is no concrete evidence that a points-based system - which has been discussed for years across political parties - will be the right step for Britain.Instead, the phrase has become a posturing shorthand for a politician pretending to crack the whip on immigration. It is an empty pledge, its only meaning to reassure those made insecure and fearful by immigration that Britain will be callous to outsiders.Priti Patels narrative is a dog-whistle, blaming immigrants for Britains problems in lieu of accepting how much damage is of her own partys making."},{"url":null,"title":"dust-forms-stars-recreated-university-lab","story":"Professor Martin McCoustra and a team of scientists from Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have spent the last  years investigating how ice forms and behaves around tiny specks in the interstellar environment.From that, new stars and planets are formed, as well as structures like the Eagle Nebula, providing a source of complex organic molecules from which le can originate.The astrochemists recreated deep space in their lab and found the dust to be much more structurally complex than first thought.Prof McCoustra compared it to a ldquobadly-baked cherry cake instead of the widely-held belief that the dust is structured like an onion.: Scots scientists unearth secrets of the Earthrsquos crust on GreenlandHe said: ldquoThese tiny little snowballs have key roles to play in the evolution of the current universe, from controlling the process of star formation to providing an inventory of organic molecules from which biology might evolve.ldquoIf we understand their formation and evolution then we can more fully appreciate those roles.ldquoThe onion model visualises the icy coat of the grains as a series of layers, where the core dust grain is first fully covered by a thick layer of water-rich ice.ldquoOn top of that layer, other species are adsorbed depending on temperature.

Many people I have spoken to think the Scottish Parliament already acted on the physical punishment of children, but in fact it hadnrsquot been proposed since .Now the time has come.There is an urgent need for Scotland and the rest of the UK to comply with international human rights law and to prohibit all forms of physical punishment.ldquoJustiable assault is a defence currently in law in Scotland.It means, as things stand, people can appear in court because of harm they have caused their own children and their solicitors can argue that the assault is ldquojustied.This is absurd. The simple and straightforward call I will be making in the Scottish Parliament tomorrow is that that defence be removed, bringing Scotland in line with recommendations from the UN and international research about the impact of physical punishment.Children must have the same rights as adults. Indeed, the UNrsquos Convention on the Rights of the Child , which is set to be embedded in Scots law, demands it.The Children Bill, as it is formally known, is based on that simple premise, not on any discussion of parenting styles.If MSPs back my bill, as I hope they will, Scotland will be leading the UKon this.Wales recently approved a similar proposal at its first stage and other nations are looking on. It was great to see our Welsh counterparts following Scotlandrsquos lead.Itrsquos clear, then, that MSPs will have an opportunity to show courageous leadership tomorrow.I have already had support from politicians of all stripes, and we just need the bravery to get it over the line.But across Europe, Scotland will be playing catch up.It is already the case that  countries protect children in this way, including the vast majority of EU member states.We often like to present ourselves at the forefront of progressive societal change in Scotland, but I am afraid that in this instance we cannot makethat claim.That is why this proposal is not radical. It is simply the recognition of the overwhelming scientic evidence that trauma and violence in early years can have a huge impact on physical and mental health for the rest of someonersquos le.The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health is clear on this.I have been working on the proposal since shortly after the  election, when I was approached by a coalition of childrenrsquos charities Barnardorsquos Scotland, Children st, NSPCC Scotland, and the Children and Young Peoplersquos Commissioner.They have a common mission ndash protect children and uphold their rights.I am most grateful for the continuous support the coalition has provided as I have progressed the bill through the legislative process.It has also been very useful to hear from Jillian van Turnhout, the former Irish senator, who secured equal protection for the children of the Irish republic.Letrsquos not pretend that enacting this would be the end of it, though.Services, especially health visitors, must be supported so that they can then support families and provide clarity. Implementation will be key.More widely, this bill provides impetus for Scotland.Like many others, I want this nation to become the best country in the world for children to grow up in. I think it is fair to say there are still many policy areas we need to improvewe are to reach that goal.For instance, we must ensure every family lives in a warm home itrsquos essential that people earn a decent wage so they can adequately provide for their children, and appropriate social security support must be in place for those who cannot work.For all the Scottish Governmentrsquos poverty reduction targets, the last few years have seen child poverty go up in Scotland, thanks largely to a UK welfare system the UN called ldquocallous and ldquosocial engineering.Last year Nicola Sturgeon promised to embrace the UNCRC into Scots law.If the UNCRC is to be truly incorporated, children need to be actively involved in decisions.They must be able to lead change, in the way our climate strikers have driven the climate emergency on to the agenda.It means children must be free to express themselves, be free of discrimination and have a decent standard of living.And upholding those rights means services and the Scottish Government will be compelled to take ldquoall effective and appropriate measures with a view to abolishing traditional practices prejudicial to the health of children.As the Childrenrsquos Commissioner told MSPs, ldquothere is no ambiguity. It is unequivocal in relation to whether the UNCRC applies to equal protection. Passing my bill could be a springboard to so much progress.Itrsquos what our children deserve.John Finnie is the Scottish Green Party MSP for the Highlands and Islands."},{"url":null,"title":"smacking-ban-defining-moment-sees-scotland-hold-head-high","story":"This is a defining moment for our children, our families, our communities and for every generation that follows us.Outside the Parliament yesterday one man told me itrsquos a moment he has been waiting for, for nearly  years.For while Scotland is again blazing a trail for the rest of the UK to follow in doing right by children and families,  countries, most recently Ireland, South Africa and Kosovo, have gone before us.Like Scotlandrsquos politicians, they have recognised the overwhelming evidence that physical punishment doesnrsquot work, can damage family relationships and can cause children le-long harm.In voting to end physical punishment yesterday, MSPs were listening not only to the scientic evidence but more importantly to the voices of Scots of all ages who said they wanted to see the law change.Hundreds of folk from across the country, from Kirkwall to Innerleithen, signed our petition to say they wanted children to have the same protection from assault as adults.Many of them shared their own stories of being physically punished as a child and described how it affected them in later le and ldquohow the memories never go away.Our political leaders have long talked of their ambitions to end violence and make Scotland the best country in the world to grow up in. Bypassing the ChildrenBill they have taken a momentous step forward so that reality is now much closer to the rhetoric. :Scotland becomes first part of the UK to ban smackingIt is humbling to be leading Children st, Scotlandrsquos national childrenrsquos charity at the culmination of such a long and hard-fought campaign to ensure that childrenrsquos right to live safe from all forms of violence is recognised in Scots law.For Children st, this work began in the s when, our then chief executive Arthur Wood CBE, started to campaign against corporal punishment in schools.Since then campaigners from Children st and other childrenrsquos charities have consistently championed the view that Scottish law needs to protect every child from every level of physical harm.There have been many moments before yesterday when they came close.There were moments when Scotland might have become the th or rd country in the world to end physical punishment of children. In  when the Scotland Act embedded human rights at the heart of the Scottish Parliament, it felt asthe progressive, family-friendly early days of devolution might be the perfect opportunity to introduce the change that many children and families were already looking for.The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child had twice condemned the United Kingdom for its failure to legislate to protect children from all forms of violence, including physical punishment, in  and .As the part of the UK that had pioneered the idea that addressing childrenrsquos needs was as important as addressing their deeds and introduced the childrenrsquos hearings system, it seemed that the early days of devolution would give us a chance to again blaze a trail by ending physical punishment.In  then deputy first minister Jim Wallace introduced a proposal to outlaw the smacking of any child under the age of three, as part of the wide-ranging criminal justice bill.However, it was not to be. Instead of introducing clarity which protected every child from all forms of assault, the bill ended up including a fudge as the politicians of the day debated whether it was oka child was hit on the legs but not the arm, or how bad the bruising on a child would have to be for it to be outlawed.Despite the setback of the criminal justice Scotland bill campaigners continued in their unwavering determination to end physical punishment. In  The Herald published a front page exclusive, based on a review of the international evidence on physical punishment.:John Finnie on why Scotland introduced a smacking banThe study by University College London found that the evidence that children were harmed by physical punishment was unequivocal. The accompanying editorial concluded that: ldquoParenting is one of the most dficult jobs any of us will do.Outlawing smacking,handled the right way, could make it easier not harder.The research provided the catalyst for the three charities and the commissioner to build a new campaign to finally bring an end to the physical punishment of children, which has had the voices of children, families and civic society at its heart.Since  hundreds of voices including the Childrenrsquos Parliament, the Scottish Youth Parliament ,the congregation of the Church of Scotland and the Federation of Public Health have joined us. Lots of little actions have created a clamour for change on behalf of Scotlandrsquos children and families. Sitting with children in the chamber yesterday, I felt proud and inspired of the country they will grow up in.Thanks to the clear-sightedness and courage of our politicians, they are assured that every future generation of children will be protected from any and all levels of physical violence.Mary Glasgow is chief executive of Children st, Scotlandrsquos national childrenrsquos charity."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10501189.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gaelic-culture-takes-centre-stage-years-royal-national-mod","story":"This year the biggest Gaelic festival in the world s to Glasgow for the first time since  for Mograved Ghlaschu, nine days filled with music, arts, and sport.The birth of the Mograved came in , and ever since then it has been organised by An Comunn Gagraveidhealach, which, for more than a century, has supported the teaching, learning, and use of the Gaelic language as well as the study and cultivation of Gaelic literature, history, music and art.The festival has held its royal charter since , becoming Am Mograved Nagraveiseanta Rigraveoghail .The main focus of the Mograved is competition, something that attracts the best in Gaelic sport and culture from Gaelic communities throughout the UK, Ireland, Australia, Canada and the US.Whether they are looking to compete or spectate, visitors can enjoy more than  competitive events in highland dancing, sport, literature, and drama, as well as Gaelic music and song.

Disposing this total of  tonnes of material properly would be the equivalent of removing , cars off UK roads every year.When sent to landfill, food waste releases methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas many times more potent than carbon dioxide in the short term.By successfully capturing food waste it can be converted into sustainable energy, instead of being sent to landfill or incineration. The resulting material can also be used as a fertiliser for soil to help grow more food, more sustainably. Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, said: “It wasn’t just fantasy when the Doc and Marty were discovering how they could power the DeLorean to time travel – they hit upon an idea that over  years later could make a signicant dference in how we combat the climate emergency.“Time is running out as we look to tackle the climate emergency. “The good news is that inedible food waste has huge potential as its energy can be used to make sustainable fuel and we can harness this by simply using our food recycling caddy. “You could provide enough power to watch the entire Back to the Future trilogy from the food held in nearly two and a half food recycling caddies.”Around  per cent of the , tonnes of food waste produced by households in Scotland every year is unavoidable.

Spending on these ads, often targeted to specic groups, has totalled more than £. million since last October.And while much of the attention has focused on the big parties and pressure groups on either side of the Brexit ide, the data also reveals the thousands of adverts placed at a local level, often seeking to influence constituents on what can appear to be seemingly mundane neighbourhood issues.Under new rules Facebook introduced in October , anyone placing a political advert must declare who paid for it.Our investigation identied around  ads on the pages of local politicians and councils which were run without these disclaimers – including  placed on behalf of sitting MPs.There is no suggestion that any of the adverts had been deliberate attempts to deceive constituents. They were all found and removed by Facebook.Most adverts placed by or on behalf of Scottish MPs from October  to September , , were for amounts less than £.There were a few exceptions – £ spent by Gordon Conservatives, £ by Lib Dem leader and East Dunbartonshire MP Jo Swinson, £ by Angus Conservatives, £ by the Perth and Kinross Conservative Association, £ by Linlithgow MP Martyn Day, and £ by the Conservative Party.For MSPs, the majority also spent sums less than £ promoting material on Facebook.The exceptions were former Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson , Anas Sarwar , Johann Lamont , Liam Kerr , Alex Rowley , Alexander BurnettPeter Chapman , Beatrice Wishart , Richard Leonard , and West Lothian Courier Partners .Two Scottish local authorities spent money with Facebook – City of Edinburgh Counciland the SNP Group on North Ayrshire Council .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"\"  Nicola Sturgeon: the Scottish Parliament’s greatest achievements viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Two Scottish politicans each had a Facebook advert removed as it appeared without a disclaimer – Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East MP Stuart McDonald and Martin Docherty-Hughes, MP for West Dunbartonshire.Unsurprisingly the biggest spenders on Facebook over the past year have included ious Brexit campaigns – People’s Vote UK , Best for BritainandBritain’s Future .Production company Slainte Media spent £, promoting former First Minister Alex Salmond’s televisionchat show.A Westminster Government spokesperson said: “There should be greater transparency in political advertising, which is why we have already pledged to introduce the requirement for digital election material to be clearly branded.

Here are some key questions surrounding the case.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Carl Beech--What is Operation Midland  The politan Policersquos bungled investigation into fabricated claims of a VIP paedophile ring in Westminster. What happened  The investigation saw the homes of D-Day veteran Lord Bramall, Lady Diana Brittan , and former Tory MP Harvey Proctor raided on the basis of  claims by fantasist Carl Beech. Beech is serving an -year jail term for fabricating a series of claims of rape, torture and murder by well-known names from the military, the security services and politicians.-- vw,vw,px, px\"Former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor--What is the Henriques report  A review by former High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques, who was called in after the -month Operation Midland ended in  without a single arrest. What has happened on Friday  The politan Police has published further details from the report ndash including previously redacted information ndash after pressure to be more transparent. The force said it took the ldquohighly unusual step of publishing signicant detail from the chapters focusing on Operation Midland which would include ldquographic, personal and sensitive information. The Met said: ldquoThis exceptional level of information is being published in response to pressing concerns and the need to dispel rumour, to demonstrate transparency and our organisational willingness to learn from past mistakes and help maintain public confidence.-- vw,vw,px, px\"The late Lord Brittan--The report is minimally redacted and criticisms of both inidual officers and the Met itself remain in the report. What did we already know  Some details of Sir Richardrsquos report were released by the force three years ago, in which he criticised the Met for: ndash Believing Beech for too longndash One officer announcing Beechrsquos claims were ldquocredible and truendash Applying for search warrants with flawed informationndash Failing to close the investigation sooner-- vw,vw,px, px\"Lord Bramall was one of the targets of the  allegations--What did we find out on Friday  As Beech was found guilty of perverting the course of justice in July, the fullest version of the report to date could be released. Sir Richard concluded the cause of the disastrous investigation was ldquopoor judgment and a failure to accurately evaluate known facts exacerbated by a culture that said lsquovictimsrsquo must be believed.The report particularly criticised a ldquodisproportionate belief in Beechrsquos credibility as well as inaccurate statements used as part of applications for search warrants on ly accusedrsquos homes.What was Operation Vincente  Fridayrsquos publication also included details of Sir Richardrsquos review of an investigation of a separate rape claim against Lord Brittan. Operation Vincente looked at an allegation that the politician raped a -year-old woman in . While he praised the actions of some of the officers involved, Sir Richard criticised the prolonged investigation as ldquomost unfair to the Brittan family.The report also said: ldquoIt is an inescapable and sad conclusion that had Lord Brittan achieved nothing in le, no further action would have been taken against him during his letime. What is going to happen next  Sir Richardrsquos report included  recommendations and Met Deputy Commissioner Sir Stephen House said the force has acted upon ldquovast majority of them, excluding some recommendations about treatment of information from the public and what is released to the media.Separately, Home Secretary Priti Patel has asked the Chief Inspector of Constabulary, Tom Winsor, to examine the Metrsquos response to the investigation, under his powers at Her Majestyrsquos Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services . The body is obligated to take on commissions from the Home Secretary and has said it will set out how the investigation will progress in due course. Five officers were referred to another police watchdog now known as the Independent Office for Police Conduct . But the body found no evidence of wrongdoing or criminality. Ms Patel has also asked the HMICFRS inspection to take into account this subsequent IOPC investigation, known as Operation Kentia. The full report is yet to be published. Is there anything in the Henriques report that will not be published  The Met has declined to publish other parts of the report because they do not relate to anyone like Beech who was proven in court to be a liar. The chapters to remain secret relate to: ndash Operation Bixley ndash part of a larger investigation named Operation Fairbank into historical allegations of sexual abuse by politicians ndash Four sections about Operation Yewtree into allegations of historical abuse by celebrities ndash A further, separate inquiry into an allegation of abuse by a celebrity Comments are closed on this article.copy -.

While Be Reasonable Scotland is concerned this new law will turn ‘good’ parents into criminals.This is a concern I share. I have vivid memories of my mum walloping me as a mouthy teenager – but should she have been prosecuted  Absolutely not, she was a great mum, and will be mortiedshe reads this article.: Scotland becomes first part of UK to ban smacking of children: Smacking laws in Scotland: current regulations, proposed changes and how the rest of the UK matches upBack in the s, hitting your kids was standard practice. Things have changed since then, as has language we use. We now talk about ‘smacking’ children, as opposed to hitting them just as we call those things we put our expensive cross-breed puppies in, crates instead of cages. It softens the blow, so to speak.Smacking our own kidsThe fact is, many of us have been driven to give our kids a smack at some point. According to a report by four leading Scottish children’s charities around % of parents in the UK have used physical punishment, with children aged three to seven the most likely to be on the receiving end.The numbers don’t surprise me. Nor do the ages of the children, as this is the time when parenting can be the most challenging. My son was three when I smacked him. Six years on, it still makes me shudder with regret.We were at the start of our holiday and had been travelling for around eight hours. I needed to change his nappy, but he wouldn’t let me. He wouldn’t stop shouting, he wouldn’t listen, he wouldn’t do a single thing I asked. So, in desperation, I smacked his very well padded bottom .And you know what  He stopped. Everything went quiet. And for a split second I felt relief. And victory. But then he turned to me and said ‘don’t you hit me’. Well, he did have a point… And then we both sobbed.A flash of furyThe essential problem with smacking or hitting your child is that it’s done in a moment of madness. It’s a flash of fury and frustration, when all other options have failed.This is what ‘time out’ was created for. It’s not just about punishing the child, it’s about giving the parent time to take a breath and calm their thoughts. There are countless times I have shut myself in the kitchen cupboard, so I can silently scream into the fridge, or bang my head against the cornflakes.I will do everything I can to avoid hitting my children because I know, in my gut, that violence is wrong. I tell me children on a daily basis not to hit each other, so how can I justy doing the same to them  We shouldn’t hit our children just because society or the law say it’s ok, or because they aren’t big enough to hit us back.In fact that is the very reason we shouldn’t hit them. Even when pushed to the limits by a tyrannical toddler, we don’t have the right to use physical violence. Just as those teachers back in the s had no right to hit our children.Many parents today look back on those times with disbelief and horror, and I wonder years from now our children will feel the same about those dark days when parents hit their children.Maybe this change in law marks the beginning of a new era of positive parenting.

It is suggested that the monarch has sought her own advice on the circumstances in which she could dismiss a prime minister. Columnist Ian Birrell reports in Monday’s paper: “One well-placed source told me the Queen had, for the first time in her reign, sought advice on sacking a prime minister before the Supreme Court verdict.”Buckingham Palace said on Sunday that it did not comment on rumours.It is understood that while there have been discussions between Downing Street and the Palace about the constitution and the Queen’s role, it would not be the case that the monarch would take it upon herself to dismiss a prime minister or advise him or her to step down.However, i understands that any discussions did not relate to an active attempt by the Queen and her most senior advisors to sack Mr Johnson.: Why the Queen made an error of judgement on proroguing Parliament – Joyce McMillan Legal positionHaving been embarrassed by the Supreme Court’s ruling that the prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, it is likely the Queen would not want to be caught out again, and would want to know her exact legal position should she be approached by opposition MPs in the event of Mr Johnson refusing to step aside after losing a vote of no confidence.It is a quirk of the British constitution that the Queen retains a number of personal discretionary powers which include the right to appoint the prime minister and other ministers. A House of Commons select committee established in  that these powers also include a right for the sovereign in a “grave constitutional crisis” to act contrary to, or even without, ministerial advice.The Queen has been dragged into a constitutional crisis by Boris Johnson over decision to prorogue ParliamentConstitutional experts are indeed ided on the exact circumstances -any - in which the Queen could remove a sitting prime minister.In the event that Mr Johnson lost a vote of no-confidence in Parliament, there would follow a -day period in which MPs can vote to put forward a candidate to replace him.Drag out proceedingsSome experts believe that only in the circumstances in which it could be shown by Parliament that an alternative prime minister can muster a majority, the Queen could require Mr Johnson to resign.Others, however, argue that the Fixed Terms Parliament Act allows a sitting prime minister to recommend an election date after that -day period and therefore Mr Johnson could drag out proceedings in the absence of a clear power for the monarch to dismiss him.The Queen has hitherto scrupulously avoided the use of any of her discretionary powers unless explicitly advised to do so by ministers.She has also been careful to avoid being seen to adopt a position on any political matters. Consequently, the claim by David Cameron that he sought the Queen’s intervention during the Scottish referendum campaign has been reportedly the source of further displeasure in Buckingham Palace.This story originally appeared in the i. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow airport incident in pictures emergency services on the scene as building evacuated","story":"All passengers have been evacuated from the international area of Glasgow Airport due to an \"ongoing incident\" involving a suspicious package.At least  firefighters are reported to be dealing with the incident.

It is not a fight we can afford to lose.”At the weekend a major protest was held at the gates of Green Pastures Church where Wrightbus main shareholder, Jeff Wright, is lead pastor.Hundreds of ex-employees yesterday attended a redundancy clinic in Ballymena following the firms collapse. Former workers queued to fill in claim forms almost a week after the bus manufacturer crashed into administration.The Wright family, who founded the bus-making company in , said the collapse of the business was due to a big fall in demand for buses in the UK market.Meanwhile, a debate in Westminster yesterday heard calls for bus operators to be encouraged with economic assistance to buy British.DUP MP Ian Paisley pushed for the commitment after seeking assurances that potential investors in Wrightbus know what British government support looks like, in terms of research and development, soft loans or grants.Asking an urgent question in the Commons, Mr Paisley asked Northern Ireland secretary Julian Smith: Could he recognise that the arms- bodies, such as Translink and First Group and other bus buyers, need to be encouraged directly with economic assistance to buy more British-made buses Could he ensure in future all bus orders go through British companies therefore supporting British jobs and British investment Mr Smith said the government is making any potential Wrightbus bidders aware of what support could be available, adding: This is a commercial process.Its been managed by an administrator and many of the actions are required to take place at a devolved level.But we will continue, and I do continue, to speak actively to all stakeholders in this issue and I am conducting meetings in the course of this week.

with Brussels could continue over the weekend as Boris Johnson continues efforts to sell his plans to the European Union..pushEuropean leaders have given his proposals short shrt in public, with senior figures dubbing his “two borders” plan for Northern Ireland “unconvincing”.Brussels said that “every day counts” as the clock ticks down to a crunch summit of EU leaders on October - and Downing Street said “we are ready to talk at any point”.The Prime Minister is expected to embark on a tour of European capitals for face-to-face talks next week as well as continuing to speak by phone to counterparts.Although the European Commission said there was no formal deadline for talks to make progress, officials made clear that time was tight.Commission spokeswoman Natasha Bertaud said: “What we have always said is that every day counts, especially as we near the end of October.“Technical-level meetings are currently ongoing in order to give the United Kingdom opportunity to present their proposals in more detail but no deadline has been set.”The Prime Minister’s Europe adviser David Frost is having further technical talks with officials in Brussels, and Downing Street said the UK was prepared to continue discussions over the weekend.A Number  spokeswoman said: “I think it’s clear that all sides want a deal.“What we have done is put forward fair and reasonable proposals to help us negotiate a new deal.“The Commission, who obviously we will be negotiating with, welcomed our determination to advance talks and make progress towards that deal.”The spokeswoman added: “We are ready to talk at any point, including over the weekend.”She also indicated the Government would consider publishing the full legal text, which has so far only been shared confidentially with Brussels.Meanwhile, Mr Johnson faces another showdown with the courts as his opponents look to force him to comply with measures which could require a delay to Brexit,The legal action – led by businessman Vince Dale, SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC and Jolyon Maugham QC – will ask the Court of Session in Edinburgh to require Mr Johnson to seek an extension to avoid leaving the EU without a deal.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jolyon Maugham QC with protestors outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh It could also later see a court official being given the power to sign the letterthe Prime Minister refuses to do so.The Court of Session’s Inner House heard the unique power of nobile officium – which would allow a court official to sign the letter requesting an extension – has never been used over a Prime Minister.Mr Johnson has repeatedly said he is prepared to take the UK out without a deal on October  – despite the Benn Act committing him to requesting an extension to Article a deal is not secured following the European Council summit.The PM told MPs in the Commons on Thursday that he had made a “genuine attempt to bridge the chasm” with Brussels by making compromises as time runs out before the Halloween Brexit date.The plans met with resistance in Brussels and Dublin.Irish premier Leo Varadkar said the Brexit plan “falls short in a number of aspects” while his deputy Simon Coveney said “ that is the final proposal, there will be no deal”.And Donald Tusk, president of the European Council – the body made of up national leaders – said he told Mr Johnson “we remain open but still unconvinced” during talks on Thursday.Downing Street said the proposals to address problems with the Irish border were the “broad landing zone” and the “basis for discussion” in a conciliatory move after Number  sources had previously claimed they represented a final offer to Brussels.Mr Johnson’s plans would see Northern Ireland apply EU rules on goods but stay in a customs territory with the UK.This would create a regulatory barrier for goods crossing the Irish Sea and create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland – but Mr Johnson has insisted there would be no need for checks or infrastructure at the frontier.Mr Coveney said: “We don’t see how the proposal to have two dferent customs territories on the island of Ireland can avoid customs checks between those territories, we don’t see how that works and the EU has the same concern, so that element of the proposal needs to be developed further.”The plans require the currently suspended Northern Ireland Assembly to approve the new arrangements, with a subsequent vote every four years – something which has caused concern in Ireland.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Northern

Prime Minister’s Brexit plan.https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland irish-deputy-leader-rules-out-reform-of-stormont-veto-in-brexit-negotiations-.htmlhttps:www.belfasttelegraph incoming article.ece fc AUTOCROP h bpanews_ca-dee--b-fffc_EmailThe Irish deputy leader has ruled out reform of the Stormont petition of concern as a path to accepting the Prime Minister’s Brexit plan..pushBoris Johnson wants to give the currently defunct Northern Ireland Assembly a vote both on whether to opt into the all-island regulatory system in , and whether to remain in it after an initial four-year period.The petition of concern essentially allows a bloc of Assembly Members from either the nationalist or the unionist community a veto on certain decisions, eventhey represent a minority in the chamber.On Friday morning, Simon Coveney rejected the idea that reforming the veto power would make any dference, as this decision lies with the EU and UK, not Northern Ireland.“We have concerns in relation to any concept that suggests one party in Northern Ireland, regardless of who they are, can veto or prevent contingency measures taking effect through a vote in the NI executive,” he said.“The idea that a minority of people could enforce a proposal on a majority of people indefinitely into the future in the context of the disruption of Brexit and mitigate against that isn’t something we can support.“We need to be clear here, mechanisms that are linked to cross community support in the executive are primarily about issues of competence for the executive on domestic decision making in Northern Ireland.“This is very dferent, this is the UK as a whole and the EU as a whole, to deal with an international border question.“The issues around the Petition of Concern are important issues, but in terms of Brexit outcome and a deal, when you look at the response in Northern Ireland yesterday, there’s only one party in Northern Ireland supporting Boris Johnson’s proposals as the basis of deal, no one  is, because there’s real problems with it.”\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith Earlier on Friday, Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith suggested reform of the petition of concern could be “helpful” in addressing the EU’s concerns about handing the DUP a veto over post-Brexit arrangements.Mr Coveney added that he is not interested in getting into a personalised war of words with the leader of the DUP over Brexit.DUP leader Arlene Foster accused the Irish Government of trying to ride roughshod over unionism, as she criticised Dublin’s rejection of the UK’s latest Brexit plan on Thursday.Mr Coveney said he would not be getting into a personalised row, and that Ireland’s position had not changed.“I’m not getting into personalised commentary like that, the Irish government has been consistent for three years now, while we respect the decision of the UK to leave the EU, we also expect the British government would take account of Irish interest, vulnerabilities and exposure and the context of those issue of any Brexit deal that is struck,” Mr Coveney said.“We now have a Prime Minister that wants to remove the backstop and we have saidhe wants to do that he has to come up with an alternative that does the same job.“The British government gave in writing in  that they would ensure during the Brexit process and after it, that the all island economy would be protected and that no border infrastructure would remerge.“That’s the test for us, and regardless of what inidual politicians say, what party they belong to, we’re not interested in personalities, quite frankly, we’re interested in the outcomes and the issues and that continues to be our focus.”Mr Coveney added Boris Johnson’s proposals are a “step in the right direction, but there are problems with the proposal, and we have to be up front and honest about that, there’s no point pretending problems are being solved when they’re not, particularly when it comes to customs”.“We don’t see how the proposal to have two dferent customs territories on the island of Ireland can avoid customs checks between those territories, we don’t see how that works and the EU has the same concern, so that element of the proposal needs to be developed further,” he added.Mr Coveney says by listening to the people who spoke out yesterday against Mr Johnson’s plans, it would be clear that many unionists in Northern Ireland do not support the proposal around customs.“Lots of unionists have dficulty with that, whether it’s the head of the Belfast Chamber of Commerce, the head of the Ulster Farmers’ Union, the CBI, virtually every business organisation in Northern Ireland, most of them headed by unionists, let’s be honest, don’t think that this is a comprehensive enough proposal to ensure we maintain borderless trade on this island.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish premier leo varadkar says brexit extension better

Coleman and Gerard Hughes exchanged scores in the aftermath of McManusrsquo red card before Nicholson gave Ballycran a - to - lead after  minutes. Two OrsquoPrey frees levelled matters in the st minute, but the drama was still unfolding.A Martin goal in the st minute put Ballycran into a - to - lead and a point from Phelim Savage increased the lead to four points just before the break.To make matters even worse for Portaferry, they had OrsquoPrey sent off after picking up a second yellow card.Ballycran now had the bit between their teeth and scores after the break from Scott Nicholsonand Phelim and Liam Savage had the McKenna Park side almost out of sight.Martin and Woods increased Ballycranrsquos lead to nine points before Portaferry hit back with scores from Colemanand Conor Mageean to leave the score at - to - with  minutes remaining.Another Coleman point left five in it, but Ballycran simply pulled away and claimed the SHC title for the th time.Ballycranrsquos Mick Branf, who managed the side with Gary Savage, was more than pleased with the way his charges went about the job.ldquoItrsquos unbelievable.

The musket and a creative writing workshop as part of the course inspired Greer to write a poem included in the booklet.Course co-ordinator Shirley Lennon said it was a pleasure to coordinate it, explaining that the  participants came from erse backgrounds.ldquoI was fascinated to see how their learning developed over the course, Shirley said. Many discoveries were made and insights gained into the period but, more importantly, into our attitudes and opinions about this part of the past.ldquoBy choosing the title lsquoour shared historyrsquo for the booklet, the participants demonstrated a key part of the learning, showing how intertwined our past is. I was pleased to see friendships developing during the course and a sense of achievement in the creation of the booklet.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey mdash who opened the conference mdashpraised the impact the PEACE IV project has had on the community.He said that exploring the legacy of the rebellion and the development of the United Irishmen provided participants with an insight into the heritage of their areas and into the very important topic of challenging preconceptions about history, in particular, the areas of shared and contested history.Cllr Casey said the event also provided participants with a chance to work together ldquoacross the community to discover their own stories and those of neighbouring and dferent communities.Further projects on Crime and Punishment in County Down and lsquoPreserving or Plundering rsquo: Museum Collecting from Hans Sloane to Modern Museumsrsquo will take place next year.

He felt that the delay had caused great inconvenience to a great number of people, who were expected to be moved.CROSSGAR mdash For the third successive year Crossgar soprano Rosemary McKibben has won a major inidual award at the Waterford International Festival of Light Opera.Following her lsquoBest Female Singerrsquo award in , Rosemany retained the Frank Ryan Cup for the lsquoBest Irish Singerrsquo which she won last year.The Belfast Operatic Companyrsquos lsquoMikadorsquo, in which she appeared, took third place at the st anniversary festival.Rosemary also figured prominently in the quartet which was awarded the Wallace Memorial Trophy for the lsquobest concerted itemrsquo and the company lted two other major awards to make its trip to Waterford well worthwhile.Rosemaryrsquos next major engagement is in the demanding role of Donna Elviva in Mozartrsquos Don Giovanni which is to be presented by the Studio Opera Group in Belfast later this month. This opera will also be presented in Down High School, Downpatrick.DUNDRUM mdash Local councillor Mr Jarlath Carey is to meet local planners soon in an attempt to save a major housing project in Dundrum.Mr Carey will be accompanied by Newcastle councillor Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghue, and Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamon OrsquoNeill, who all condemned a refusal by planners this week to allow the project to go ahead.The project is to develop a -acre site to provide about  new private homes and it has been turned down because it is too big.The planners say the proposed development would be out of scale and character with the existing village and would be prominent in the villagersquos landscape.The have also said the site is outside the area considered suitable for future development in Dundrum.A planning spokesman told local councillors at a meeting on Monday that the bulk of new development of this type should be directed at district towns such as Downpatrick rather that to smaller towns like Dundrum.Mr Carey called on councillors to support a plea to planners to reconsider their decision and said he didnrsquot support the philosophy that larger development projects should go to larger towns.TANNAGHMORE mdash A landmark in the Tannaghmore district for the past century was thoughtlessly destroyed this week mdash not by vandals but by DoE workmen.The landmark took the form of a holly tree, which was shaped like an igloo, and had a seat cut inside it, but it was destroyed when workmen carried out hedge trimming operations in the area.The tree, referred to as the lsquoCourting Treersquo or lsquoCourting Denrsquo by generations, had been maintained for many years by Eddie Kelly. He took pride and delight in looking after the tree, and trimmed it three years a year.A feature in the countryside in the Tannaghmore Road area, the tree was once a rendezvous for the couples of yesteryear. The tradition was thatyou were first at the den, you were set for the night!Many couples fromthe nearly Castlenavan, Seaforde, Loughinisland and Drumaness areas visited the tree regularly, particularly around the turn of the century and after.Now, however, the tree is ruined. The hedge-trimming saw the tree almost dissected and what remains could never be trained back to its former self.This ended the lsquoCourting Treersquosrsquo legend and thatrsquos why residents on the Tannaghmore Road are angry mdash that canrsquot understand how the workmen allowed such destruction to take place.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police in Ballynahinch are anxious to trace a lsquobogus doctorrsquo who entered the home of an elderly man at Magherahamlet and stole pound.The lsquodoctorrsquo, about  years old, average height, and slim build, was wearing a long, dark coloured coat when he broke into the house on Saturday afternoon. He was found searching drawers in the h ouse by the elderly resident, who is under doctorrsquos care, but he identied himself as a doctor.However, when he left, the man discovered around pound was missing. He contacted police, who believed the intruder was a lsquobogus doctorrsquo.BALLYKINLAR mdash A new training establishment has been set up at Ballykinlar to increase the skills of the Ulster Defence Regiment.This new instructional base will be used by full time and part time members of the UDR who will be taught to counter the increased sophistication of terrorist activity.The camp is staffed by instructors from the UDR, Regular Army units in the province and others from the School of Infantry at Warminster, and will be assisted by the RUC.

2019 Spa.jpg","title":"Spa resident’s delight after ‘nightmare’ over sewer issue resolved  ","story":"A CRUCIAL meeting has taken place to establish the scale of work required at a private housing development at the Spa to bring sewers, a sewage pumping station, roads and footpaths up to standard.Residents who live at the Carnglave Manor development say they have had to experience ldquonightmare conditions for the past six years and are pleased that the Department of Infrastructure is to formally adopt the estate, which will mean it will be responsible for its upkeep.In December , Stuart Boyd and his young family moved into the estate but what followed was years of ongoing drainage issues due to a fault with a pumping station, with the problem exacerbated by the fact part of the  year-old development had not been adopted by the relevant departmental bodies.Mr Boyd mdash whose family home sits in the middle of the development mdash is the first to be affected by ongoing technical issues with the water pump that regulates drainage, with Carnglave Manor also affected by flooding problems due to heavy rainfall which results in drains overflowing and sandbags being used to stop water reaching residentsrsquo homes.The frustrated resident revealed that within weeks of moving into the new family home, issues started to arise, with the first problem starting in the en-suite shower where water was not fully draining away after the shower had been turned off. Mr Boyd said he checked for blockages but discovered none.The en-suite toilet started to experience problems by not fully draining after flushing, with water rising to the top of the rim. Then a second toilet became affected with the same issue and could not be used.Mr Boyd contacted NI Water and was informed that the problem could not be investigated fully due to the fact that part of the development had not been adopted and that the issue was ldquohistorical.However, emergency action was taken for the problem to be resolved temporarily and the drains were cleared.A matter of weeks later, the same issue happened again and Mr Boyd made contact with the developer who informed him of a ldquoquick fix to resolve the problem.ldquoI was told by the developer that to sort the problem was to restart the sewage station pump by pressing buttons on an electrical , he said.ldquoThis worked fine over the years but became tedious as I had to do it so often. When my we was heavily pregnant with our third child two years ago the problem happened again, but the switch I normally pressed failed to work.Mr Boyd said repairs were then carried out and steps seemed to be taking place to adopt the street in Carnglave Manor. He was also concerned that despite being told a formal adoption would take place, nothing happened.The resident contacted Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis to investigate the issue and is delighted that things are now moving in the right direction as a result of him putting pressure on the relevant departments.Cllr Lewis described the adoption of Carnglave Manor as ldquoan immediate necessity for the progression of completion and resident safety and that the issue had been allowed to go on for too long. He said a process had begun to access so-called bond monies to carry out the necessary repairs.Cllr Lewis added: ldquoThere are a number of issues with the equipment which remain unresolved and NI Water and roads officials have been working in collaboration toward ensuring that bond monies paid by the contractor are utilised to ensure that necessary repairs are carried out which would bring the pumping station up to spec for adoption.The councillor said he was ldquohorried to discover Mr Boyd had been educated on the operation of the pumping equipment to ensure proper drainage which sometimes involved him walking down the street in the middle of the night to reset the electronic pump.ldquoI am also advised that residents have in previous years unblocked drains and battled flood waters they have been living in absolute horror. The purchase of a family home should be joyous, exciting and fulfilling. Instead, residents have had to endure misery, worry, stress strain and hassle.Cllr Lewis confirmed that due to frequent periods of heavy flooding in the development he has contacted Rivers Agency requesting flood maps to assessthe area is prone to or at risk of flooding and has asked Land and Property Services to explore the possibility of a rates rebate for Carnglave Manor residents.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said she aware of the situation at Carnglave Manor and, as the developer had failed to complete the site to the appropriate standard, had initiated enforcement action.ldquoThis is with a view to carrying out the necessary works to bring the sewers, sewerage pumping station and roads footways up to adoption standard, she explained.The spokeswoman added: ldquoThe Department is meeting with Northern Ireland Water this week to fully establish the extent of defects in the sewers and sewerage pumping station.

After each appearance in front of their juvenile worships the offending drivers then watch graphic road safety videos featuring more children, with the goal to change driver behaviour.Those behind the scheme say itrsquos a simple but effective idea where PSNI road safety officers will liaise with particular schools about running kidsrsquo courts or teachers as part of road safety classes.When the go-ahead for the scheme is given, police turn up outside schools on the given morning and anyone they detect ndash as long as they are not travelling inordinately fast mdash will have the option there and then of appearing in front of the children, or taking the fine and penalty points.The PSNI is supporting the new initiative, which has proved successful in other areas, with officers hoping that meeting children face-to-face will change driversrsquo behaviour.The districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnershipis driving the change for an increased focus on road safety across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area with the emphasis on reducing speed to make the areas safer for drivers and pedestrians.And the organisation is fully behind the kidsrsquo court scheme which provides children with an opportunity to talk directly to drivers and send a very clear message about road safety.In addition to the kidsrsquo courts, other measures the PCSP wants to provide include a general road safety awareness campaign across the district, distribution of school safety signs and the installation of speed indicator devices.Local politicians describe the kidsrsquo court initiative as ldquoproactive and say that it will highlight to drivers the vulnerability of children aged between three and  who attend primary schools across the district.They say children will effectively be educating drivers who have exceeded the speed limit outside their respective schools to the potential of what could have happened. Politicians say the scheme is not trying to catch people out, but make the roads safer for everyone.Local councillors Oonagh Hanlon and Willie Clarke have welcomed the new initiative and hope people across the district will be more road safety aware. They believe that working with young people is a very effective way to deliver the road safety message.In addition, they also believe thatthe kidsrsquo court is successful in changing the mindset of even a few drivers it will help make busy roads outside primary schools much safer.Cllr Hanlon said she has been contacted by many primary schools in rural areas, requesting assistance with road safety around their respective locations.She said that with large volumes of children being ped off and picked up within short timeframes, the school run can become a ldquodangerous experience for young pupils in particular.Cllr Hanlon continued: ldquoSchool safety signs will be a visual reminder for drivers to exercise extra caution. Motorists caught speeding outside a primary school will be given the option of avoiding a fine by attending a special lsquokidsrsquo courtsrsquo where the judges are children.ldquoIn front of a  of young pupils, drivers will have to explain why they have broken the speed limit and itrsquos hoped that face-to-face interaction will change driversrsquo behaviour.She added: ldquoThis concept not only empowers our young people but also challenges motorists from a childrsquos perspective on why they would break rules which endanger their safety.Cllr Clarke said road safety was an issue he had campaigned on tirelessly over the years and particularly welcomed the introduction of speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoThis has proved every successful in other areas in reducing speed and increasing safety on our roads..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17912970.magical-night-great-music/resources/images/10497516.jpg","title":"bandstand baby witch","story":"Who are the members of your band and what instrument do they play How would you describe your sound What local gigs do you have coming up What is your favourite song to play and why What has been your biggest gig to date Any funny gig rehearsal stories Who are your major influences What inspires your songwriting What is your dream gig What is the best thing about performing Any last words This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ministers have attacked our independent judges. The Government is spending millions on an advertising campaign that appears to conflict with an Act of Parliament and all the meanwhile jobs, security and stability are put further and further at risk.Boris Johnson is playing Russian roulette with all of our lives over Brexit, and we cannot stand by and let him do it.The last three years have been a shambles, and it is clear we will now need to go back to the people for them to have the final say.That is why the case for a Peoplersquos Vote, where a credible deal is put to the British people, with the option to Remain, provides the best and most democratic ways of ending this crisis.Readers will know I think Brexit is a disaster for our jobs, security and international standing ndash and so would campaign resolutely to Remain in that scenario.Either way, I believe we need to heal some of the isions in this country and get back to focusing on the issues we all want to talk about.Despite the Brexit chaos, Irsquove continued to work hard on lots of other issues locally.It was a real pleasure to attend the Penarth Picnic at the weekend, and I want to thank Penarth Town Council, Production  and all those involved for a great event ndash showcasing the best of Penarthrsquos wonderful community spirit. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Yet, too many people across the UK ndash and here in Wales ndash are going hungry.It is shameful that in the sixth richest country on the planet people are struggling to put food on the table.A recent report by the South Wales Food Alliance has shown that  per cent of  to -year-olds ran out of food in the past year and , children in Wales are living in households for whom a healthy diet is increasingly unaffordable.In addition, the Trussell Trust has reported record numbers of people accessing its services. Last year, it provided over , emergency food parcels to people in crisis in Wales, , of them to children. A No Deal Brexit will be catastrophic for the countryrsquos most vulnerable households and would be an act of economic self-harm impacting many generations to come. This is why I am supporting the campaign for Food Justice.There can be no doubt that the causes of rising hunger are rooted in a decade of austerity, tax and welfare changes, and an economy that no longer provides a fair dayrsquos pay for a fair days work for too many.The food crisis that the UK is living through is likely to be signicantly worsenedwe leave the EU without a deal. The recently published government documents on Operation Yellow Hammer predict shortages of some fresh foods and an increase in the price of food by up to  per cent, as a likely scenario.The papers make for grim reading for the many hard pressed families who are already struggling to put food on the table.In Wales we are committed to eradicating food poverty but we need UK-wide action.The Co-operative campaign is calling on the UK Government to commit to zero-hunger by  and incorporate it into UK law.While many of the solutions to food poverty are the responsibility of the UK Government there is local action that we can take that can make a real dference.The campaign is encouraging councils across Wales to commit to playing their part by designating a lead member for food poverty, to draw up a food action plan, and to take inspiration from emerging community responses to food poverty.The good news is that there is a huge amount of work already going on in our communities by councils, churches, charities and food banks.For more information or to get involved in the campaign please visit www.party.coop campaign food-justice article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This compares to five per cent of the population in , when  per cent of adults smoked.However, there has also been an increase in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape.:The National Survey for Wales shows that, in ,  per cent of e-cigarettes users also smoked cigarettes. This fell to  per cent in  .Across the UK the number of vapers who are ex-smokers reached . per cent in  with the main reason given for using e-cigarettes being to help them quit.Of those surveyed by ASH Wales,  per cent of e-cigarette users cited health as their main reason for vaping.Suzanne Cass, chief executive of ASH Wales said: ldquoThe rise in the numbers of ex-smokers who now vape in Wales shows that many smokers are using e-cigarettes to quit.ldquoIndeed, when coupled with behavioural support e-cigarettes have been shown to be one of the most effective ways to give up smoking, enabling thousands of smokers in Wales to break a habit that destroys lives.ldquoHowever, with more than double the amount of people in Wales smoking compared to vaping, we still face a major challenge when it comes to changing peoplersquos behaviour and de-normalising what has become an entrenched habit in many of our most deprived communities.Despite the increase in the number of people vaping, the survey also revealed perceptions of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes have worsened.Now almost a third of people in Wales believe e-cigarettes are equally or more harmful than tobacco cigarettes.Suzanne Cass said: ldquoThere is work to be done when it comes to raising awareness of the relative harm of e-cigarettes compared to tobacco cigarettes and addressing concerns about the safety of vaping.Since the survey was carried out, reports of a possible link between e-cigarette use and deaths from lung disease in America have led some medical experts to warn of the dangers of vaping.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention many of those vapers affected had used products with liquids containing cannabinoid products.E-cigarettes are regulated in the UK in line with a set of European-wide rules by the medicines regulator, the MHRA. The MHRA also monitors adverse reactions through its yellow card system, which to date has not identied serious respiratory problems similar to that found in the US.Meanwhile vapers in the UK are urged by ASH to only ever purchase e-cigarettes from reputable suppliers. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We were a mix of young people, parents and other concerned citizens of Penarth, and met outside Grfin Books.ldquoWe joined the young people who have been striking from school. In a year this movement has grown from Greta Thunberg by herself to millions worldwide.ldquoThe evidence on climate change is clear. Our actions through burning fossil fuels and demands for continued economic growth cause global warming and climate change. People are already suffering and nature, upon which we all depend, is collapsing. Governments need to be honest about this and act upon the crisis.ldquoWe were over the moon with the response from Penarth residents, who walked with us or cheered us on, the day really gave us hope that the message is seeping in and change can happen. Myself and others had been feeling quite down because climate change is scary, we are worried about our childrenrsquos futures. Lets hope this walk leads to more local action on climate change.The young people on the march also spoke about their concerns.ldquoI went on strike because people cut down rainforests just to be able to eat meat, said seven-year-old Mylo Kitchiner. ldquoIf we keep cutting down trees we wonrsquot have oxygen to breath. I want the government to stop people cutting down trees.

They must know that there are real-world consequences from dangerous language.I have many friends who took a respectful and dferent view from me on Brexit. Like the overwhelming majority of Welsh and British people, they are perfectly capable of expressing that view without resorting to threats, aggression or violence.We must all learn to disagree well, however robust our views and remember that we all share this country and this planet - and that we genuinely have more in common.Meanwhile, it has been another extraordinary week in these turbulent political times.After we had the shock news that I wrote about last week ndash that the Supreme Court had delivered a unanimous judgement that Parliament should not have been shut down by the PM ndash we were able to go back immediately.I was straight back to Westminster having meetings with colleagues, holding the government to account, and of course getting back to work not just on Brexit but on many other issues.I was able to raise concerns in the Commons on behalf of constituents relating to the Thomas Cook collapse, which has affected everybody from holiday-makers to pilots to holiday reps and retail workers in the constituency and to call for a debate on the incineration of waste.And on Monday, I joined Allied Steel and Wire Pensioners from the constituency, and others hit by pensions theft, to hand in a petition to the Prime Minister at  Downing Street. They deserve justice on their pensions and have my full support. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Armagh crossroads, plagued with a high level of accidents, is to get a reduced speed limit after intense lobbying by residents.Local MLA William Irwin has been at the forefront of the campaign to have traffic calming at Ardress crossroads.The DUP MLA welcomed additional signage and awareness works at the notorious junction.Crash after crash has beenhighlighted by the MLA and he has echoed the warnings by local residents that ‘sooner or later someone will get killed’.Mr Irwin has been consistently lobbying for improvements and he welcomed what he called a “very focused lobby” from residents in the vicinity in assisting in relaying real concerns over safety at the crossroads.Mr Irwin said: “These additional works including the implementation of a mph speed limit and extra signage and road markings is very welcomed and I thank Transport NI for their continued efforts in this regard.”He continued: “There has been a high level of collisions at this location and I know that residents and road users generally have been really concerned that sooner or later a fatality will occur. “A number of improvements have been made in recent times however, worryingly, accidents still occur at an alarming rate. “Residents have been very proactive in their lobby and I have joined fully with them in continuing my lobby for improvements. “This is seeing results which is pleasing to see from a safety point of view,” said the DUP MLA.Mr Irwin said:“Additional signs have been erected including a speed limit and there are more warning markings etc to be added to all approaches to the crossroads.“And I am hopeful that this will help in alerting drivers to the fact that they must stop at the junction and wait until the route is clear. “I will continue with the residents to monitor this issue and continue to raise their concerns going forward.” PSNI probe ‘serious’ assaults which left victims hospitalisedThieves ransack woman’ home while she was out on volunteer community work

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get.

The company had been in talks to seek a buyer, with business advisory firm Deloitte being appointed. But this morning the -year-old family-owned firm has now entered administration. Around , of the firms , employees have now been made redundant. Unite addressed staff and journalists on Wednesday morning. The union has warned that up to , workers could be directly, and indirectly, impacted. Directors at the maker of the so-called Boris bus had been in talks with companies including Chinese giant Weichai and entrepreneur Jo Bamford about a potential sale. But talks broke down last week, with the amount of rent to be paid on the companys premises believed to be a stumbling block. Wrightbus, which was co-founded by Sir William Wright, has faced trading dficulties after a downturn in demand for its products. A spokesperson for the Wright family said: \"We are devastated at the news today that the company has been placed in administration by the Wright Group Board. Global changes from diesel to electric in bus technology have caused a sharp decline in demand for buses in the UK. As a shortfall became apparent, one of the steps taken was to move work from our Malaysia facility back to Ballymena to secure jobs here.\" \"These factors have resulted in signicant losses at Wrightbus which our family has been covering for over a year. This was undertaken to both protect the workforce and the engineering expertise in the company. It simply became impossible to sustain that level of support. \"We have worked hard to support the restructuring team based in Wrightbus, and we are confident that a buyer for the business can still be found. We would like to thank the bank for supporting the company over  years and in particular the last six months.\" \"Since it was established in  from a tin shed, Wrightbus has become a world leader in bus manufacture and technology, employing tens of thousands of people. The company has built a culture and tradition of expertise and innovation in the Ballymena area which is recognised across the globe. The production of the world-famous London Routemaster is just one example of the many achievements of the firm and we are hopeful that a new buyer will be found and that work at the factory can continue.\" Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, says \"news that Wrightbus has entered administration is a devastating blow to the staff, the manufacturing sector across Northern Ireland and particularly damaging to the Ballymena economy\". \"Businesses in the supply chain have been doing what they can to support the company over this past year in the hope the business can be saved. \"They to face some very uncertain months as they try to secure the money they are owed and replace the trade they have done with the Wrightbus. \"That wont be easy as theres a signicant cooling of demand across the UK economy as Brexit bites and buyers reluctant to make big capital purchases. \"The company have a great product and a very talented workforce. Hopefully the administration process will see the firm put back on to a firm footing. \"But in doing that, it is important to protect the SMEs in the supply chain.\" Michael Magnay and Peter Allen of Deloitte were today appointed as joint administrators to Wrights Group Limited, Wrightbus Limited, Wright En-Drive Limited, Wright Composites Limited and Metallix Limited. Mr Magnay, joint administrator, said: “It is bitterly disappointing for all concerned that despite extensive efforts over recent months it has not been possible to find a buyer who wanted to maintain the business as a going concern. “We recognise the Companies are crucially important employers in Ballymena, and this will be devastating news for those who worked there, their families and the town, which has already suffered from a number of manufacturing closures in recent years. We will continue to support employees through this dficult time. “The joint administrators will explore all remaining options for the business and assets, and would encourage any parties with an interest to contact them.” The Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Maureen Morrow, expressed her deep sadness following the announcement Wrightbus has entered administration. I am deeply saddened by this announcement and the loss of so many jobs. “Following requests from elected members, a special council meeting will be held on Tuesday evening at pm to discuss the emerging situation.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jo-control-room_.jpg","title":"m green energy plan for northern ireland","story":"Posted on Thursday  September  by Ulster Business Northern Ireland’s electricity operator has outlined a major £m five-year investment plan for a green energy system here.

The Top  Northern Ireland Companies  dinner, with AL Goodbody, brought together some of top business chiefs making the list, to the grand backdrop of Queen’s University’s Great Hall. The event heard renewed calls for securing a deal on Brexit, and the restoration of Stormont, as we approach , days without a devolved government here. John Mulgrew, editor of Ulster Business, told those gathered: “On the precipice of Brexit, the voice of business has never been stronger or more important – further enforcing the need for a deal. Avoiding a hard exit. And retaining a strong trading relationship across the island. “But we should also take this opportunity to clearly note, that we are approaching , days since having a devolved government – up and running. “It affects you and your businesses, and it’s cited as the key reason putting off investment from overseas, and our own local companies, from making key investment decisions.” The Top  edition is an annual showcase of the leading and largest companies, located right across Northern Ireland. This year sales rose by almost %, approaching a combined figure of £bn. And for the eighth year in a row, poultry processing giant Moy Park has come in at the number one spot, with turnover of £.bn. Michael Neill, head of Belfast office at AL Goodbody, said: “What the Top  companies have achieved in the past  months in what can only be described as capricious circumstances is truly remarkable – but imagine what could have been achieved had we some semblance of ‘normality’. “My hope is that we find ourselves doing so in a Northern Ireland that is embarking on a new and positive era of opportunity, rather than picking up the shattered pieces of a ‘no deal’ Brexit for many years to come.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"firms must prepare for no deal as economic forecast revised down","story":"Posted on Tuesday October  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland firms must prepare for a ‘no deal’ Brexit – a bank chief economist has warned – as it downgraded its forecast for the economy to .%.

Possibilities included a no-deal exit, a withdrawal agreement being reached, an extension of Article  period or a general election.
