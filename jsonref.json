[{"url":null,"title":"The story picture Andrew Virginia Giuffre Maxwell journalist scooped world","story":"Share this article She was headhunted for the job by Maxwell, who spotted her at Donald Trump\u0027s Mar a Lago club in Palm Beach, where she was a $9-an-hour changing-room assistant and her father was a maintenance manager.The club employed scores of workers in similar positions over the years, but gradually I accumulated clues: a source recalled that her maiden name was Virginia Roberts.And I learned that she continued to date her high-school sweetheart, Tony Figueroa, after Maxwell trained her to give Epstein \u0027erotic massages\u0027.His family\u0027s address was in old property records. They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry renews Frogmore Cottage lease making eligible serve Queen Counsellor","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry will renew Frogmore Cottage lease to keep serving Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"Man City star Phil Foden mother involved scuffle","story":"Share this articlePhil Foden\u0027s mum Claire, 41, caught in alcohol-fuelled brawl which left a woman with black eyes and bite marks"},{"url":null,"title":"Queen 95 tested positive Covid mild cold like symptoms","story":" The monarch is expected to foot part of the bill for her son\u0027s settlement in a bid to draw a line under it before her much-anticipated Platinum Jubilee celebrations this summer.But there is anger at how the Queen has effectively been forced to bail out the \u0027disgraced\u0027 Duke of York, 61, whose modest pension from his time in the Royal Navy is now his only visible income - amid calls for the public to be told who is financing the deal.Andrew marked the quietest royal birthday in modern history yesterday as he looks to lay low after settling his sex abuse case.The muted celebration of his 62nd birthday came just hours after the death of Jeffrey Epstein\u0027s \u0027pimp\u0027, who was accused of trafficking hundreds of girls to the paedophile financier.French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, 76, who allegedly procured more than a thousand women and girls for Epstein to sleep with, was found hanged in his prison cell in an alleged suicide on Saturday morning. And Charles could also be questioned by the Met Police as part of its criminal \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation into his aide and charity. The Royal, 73, nor anyone in his household have been spoken to as part of the force\u0027s assessment on whether to probe how a Saudi billionaire donor got a knighthood and UK citizenship after donations to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.Instead officers have liaised with staff at the charity, who have provided documents for the scoping exercise.But Charles and his former right-hand aide Michael Fawcett, 59, have been both explicitly named in the two letters to the Met that sparked the investigation. Fawcett stepped down in October amid claims he promised to help secure a CBE and British citizenship for Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz - a donor to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.It was alleged that he paid thousands of pounds to \u0027fixers\u0027 with links to the prince who said they could secure him an honour in return for donations.Clarence House has denied Charles knew anything about the allegations being investigated. And Prince Harry the monarch has also been dealing with revelations that Prince Harry tried to keep details of his legal battle to reinstate his police protection secret from the public.High Court documents show he sought a far-reaching confidentiality order on documents and witness statements surrounding his case against the Government.But the Home Office argued for transparency, saying \u0027there must be a sufficiently good reason, in the wider public interest, to justify the departure from open justice that such an order involves\u0027. The Queen\u0027s positive test comes as Boris Johnson today urged people to be \u0027more confident and get back to work\u0027 as he heralded this coming Thursday as Covid Freedom Day. The PM gave an upbeat assessment ahead of unveiling his \u0027Living with Covid Plan\u0027 tomorrow, insisting vaccines and new treatments can be relied upon to keep the public safe.All curbs - including legal self-isolation - are set to end in England within days, and Mr Johnson made clear that the taxpayer cannot keep shelling out £2billion a month on mass testing.In a compromise between the Treasury and Department of Health, he will lay out a timetable for axing free tests - but they are still likely to be available for more vulnerable and older age groups.As cases continue to tumble - down 25 per cent week-on-week - Mr Johnson insisted he did not want people to \u0027throw caution to the winds\u0027 but he wanted to remove \u0027compulsion\u0027 and let iniduals take responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"Queen plans honour appointments online phone following positive Covid test","story":"Share this articleBuckingham Palace to remain ‘cautious’ despite relaxing of Covid rules"},{"url":null,"title":"Aussie judge approves boys request formally adopt teddy bears","story":"Share this article \u0027Not sure how many similar requests they get, but this seemed to go above and beyond.

Parliament’s house health committee has begun scrutinising Public Health (Amendment) Bill 2021 which seeks to make coronavirus vaccinations mandatory, Reuters reported. “According to the proposal, those who do not get vaccinated against Covid-19 will be fined four million shillings or (receive) a jail term of six months,” parliament said in a statement on its website. The parliament statement quoted health minister Jane Ruth Aceng as telling lawmakers on the committee that mandatory vaccinations would ensure enough people are vaccinated so that “we create mass immunity. It is important that whoever is supposed to be vaccinated, is vaccinated.” The statement did not say when the proposed law was likely to be brought before all members of parliament for approval. It comes as the city battles to curb a coronavirus outbreak that has overwhelmed healthcare facilities in the global financial hub. The error had already been boosted by anti-vaxxer and anti-lockdown groups that support the use of ivermectin to treat Covid despite it being labelled “ineffective” by Australia’s chief medical officer. The television programme A Current Affair broadcast a segment on Monday night about the Queen’s Covid diagnosis. The segment featured Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, a Victoria GP and former Australian Medical Association boss who has been at the forefront of the Covid response, including spearheading testing and vaccination clinics in Melbourne’s west. As Haikerwal discussed how drug treatments could benefit elderly Covid patients, vision showed stock images of vials of sotrovimab, an intravenous monoclonal antibody treatment used for high-risk cases. The footage then switched to a medication box with a label reading “stromectol, containing 3mg ivermectin”. Haikerwal told  Australia he did not mention any specific treatments in his interview with A Current Affair and expressly ruled out recommending ivermectin for Covid patients. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, announced that from 11:59pm on Friday, the public health recommendation for Victorians to work or study from home will be removed and masks will only be required in certain settings including public transport, hospitals and primary schools, and for workers in hospitality, retail and large events. It aligns with a similar plan which will take effect in New South Wales from Friday. “We’re going to a situation on Friday where there are essentially no Covid rules, or so few that it’s unrecognisable to what it was a year ago, and indeed what it was two years ago,” Andrews said on Tuesday. The Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, also said her government would relax the requirement to wear masks in most indoor settings, from 6pm on 4 March. The First Minister will speak in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon as the Scottish Government’s blueprint for managing and recovering from Covid is published, PA Media reported. When she updated MSPs on the pandemic earlier this month, she said Scotland was “through the worst” of the Omicron wave and the situation was “much more positive” than at the start of the year. On Monday, Sturgeon said it would be “unacceptable” for public health decisions of the devolved administrations to be impacted by funding decisions taken by the UK Government. During a visit to the Social Bite cafe in Edinburgh, the First Minister was asked if she was considering automatic trigger points for new restrictions. She said:  The Emergencies Act was approved in parliament by 185 to 151, with the minority Liberal government getting support from left-leaning New Democrats. The special measures, announced by Trudeau a week ago, have been deemed unnecessary and an abuse of power by some opposition politicians, Reuters reported. Over the weekend, Canadian police restored normalcy in Ottawa. The protesters initially wanted an end to cross-border Covid vaccine mandates for truck drivers, but the occupation turned into a broader demonstration against Trudeau and his government. Protesters blocked the busiest land crossing between Canada and the United States for six days. Earlier on Monday, Trudeau told reporters his government still needed temporary emergency powers citing “real concerns” about threats in the days ahead. “This state of emergency is not over. There continue to be real concerns about the coming days,” Trudeau said. The act grants authorities broader powers. Police spent two days clearing protesters from downtown Ottawa, making 191 arrests and towing 79 vehicles by the time the operation ended on Sunday. The global financial hub deploys a “dynamic zero Covid” strategy similar to mainland China’s, aiming to eradicate any outbreaks at all costs. Authorities have been on high alert as a new wave of infections is proving harder to control, Reuters reported. Daily infections numbers have risen sharply this year, reaching a record 7,533 cases on Monday, overwhelming the government’s testing, hospital and quarantine capacities. The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) took 36 samples for testing from a batch of around 1,100 cartons of frozen beef, weighing a total of 29 tonnes, imported from Brazil by sea. It found one outer packaging and two inner packaging samples tested positive. It also collected 12 samples from a batch of around 300 cartons of frozen pork skin, weighing around 7 tonnes, imported from Poland via sea. One inner packaging sample tested positive for Covid. “The CFS has ordered the importers concerned to dispose the beef and pork skin of the same batches,” the government said in a statement late on Monday. “In addition, the CFS will step up the sampling of similar products for testing.”It comes as they tightened a cordon around a convoy that has been camped outside Parliament for two weeks. The clashes in the capital of Wellington came a day after police reported that some of the protesters had thrown human faeces at them, the Associated Press reported. Police Assistant Commissioner Richard Chambers told reporters the actions of some of the protesters, who oppose coronavirus vaccine mandates, were unacceptable and would be dealt with assertively. “Our focus remains on opening the roads up to Wellingtonians and doing our absolute best to restore peaceful protest,” Chambers said. “The behaviour of a certain group within the protest community is absolutely disgraceful.” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said protesters had taken things too far and needed to return home. “What’s happening in Wellington is wrong,” she said. The latest clashes began after about 250 officers and staff arrived at dawn and used forklifts to move concrete barriers into a tighter cordon around the encampment, where hundreds of cars and trucks remain blocking city streets. Police have used the barriers this week to allow protest cars to leave but none to enter. Video posted online shows a white car driving the wrong way down a one-way street toward a group of officers who quickly get out of the way while people shout. The vehicle comes to a stop at the police line and several officers climb inside and pull out the driver. Police said the officers had been lucky to escape injury after the car stopped just short of colliding with them. They said they had arrested one person for driving in a dangerous manner and two others for obstructing police. Chambers said the three officers who were sprayed with the unknown stinging substance had been treated at a hospital and were recovering well.The KDCA classed severe cases as people who were hospitalised in intensive care units, Reuters reported.

Photograph: Dara Mac Dónaill The Religious Sisters of Charity have urged planners to allow housing on their land at Merrion Road in south Dublin, in a move that could value the site at €50 million if it is sold for residential development. The order’s application to Dublin City Council comes less than two years after the closure of a nursing home and convalescent home at the Dublin 4 campus led to big job losses.The property, adjacent to St Vincent’s hospital complex and the new national maternity hospital site, is described as being in a “prime” suburban location. The nuns have had a presence there since the 1860s, when they opened a home for the “Destitute Catholic Blind”.In a formal submission to the council, they said the site buildings are physically and functionally obsolete and argued that “underutilised” land opens up an opportunity to deliver “high quality residential development and address housing need”.Advisers to the Sisters asked to change the zoning on about 4 hectares (9.88 acres) of its 6.55-hectare campus to reflect the “future development potential” of institutional lands. Citing nearby sales of housing land for €5 million per acre, a senior property industry source estimated that the nuns’ site could fetch “€50 million-plus” with zoning for homes. A spokeswoman for the order had no comment on the submission. The order placed St Mary’s nursing home and the Caritas convalescent home at Merrion Road in liquidation in July 2020, a move that proved controversial. It also shut St Monica’s nursing home at Belvedere Place, Dublin. The order said funds were not available to pay staff a full redundancy package. Seán McElhinney, assistant general secretary at the union Fórsa which represented staff at the three sites, said “approximately 208 workers” were made redundant. They only received a statutory redundancy payment, the minimum required by law “and were offered a €3,000 ‘goodwill’ payment on a take-it-or-leave-it basis”, he said. “The news that the site is to be monetised will only serve to rub salt in the wounds of the workers who have lost so much.”The Sisters of Charity ran five industrial schools investigated by the Ryan Commission and offered €5 million towards the costs of the State redress scheme for survivors. Just €2 million was contributed, the last payment being made in 2013.They also ran two Magdalene Laundries at Donnybrook, Dublin, and Peacock Lane, Cork. They declined to contribute to the State redress scheme for women who had been in the laundries. All four religious congregations which ran the 10 laundries operating in Ireland up to 1996 declined to do so.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"euro 2028 joint bid could see ireland host a quarter of games","story":"The Aviva Stadium in Dublin. Photograph: Evan TreacyInphoThe island of Ireland could host a quarter of the games in Euro 2028 under a proposed joint bid to host the football tournament with England, Scotland and Wales.The Cabinet is expected to be updated on Tuesday on the decision by the five football associations across Britain and Ireland to pursue the European Championships rather than the 2030 World Cup.The Government here is waiting for more information on the costs and benefits of hosting before making a decision to support efforts to land the tournament.However, Minister of State for Sport Jack Chambers is due to brief ministerial colleagues on the current status of the planned bid by the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) and its counterparts in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.Issues still under consideration include the costs that may occur depending on the size of the tournament and whether there will be 24 teams or an increase to 32 – something that has been mooted by Uefa.This would factor into how many games would be held in Ireland, but there is an expectation a quarter of the matches overall would be played on both sides of the Border if the bid were to go ahead and be successful.The potential bid is being positively viewed within government, including the potential to strengthen North-South and east-west ties.The State had spent about €155,000 on scoping out a potential joint bid for the 2030 World Cup before that proposal was dropped by the five football associations in favour of pursuing Euro 2028. Sources said the feasibility work can be repurposed.The Cabinet is not expected to make a decision on Tuesday, but the bid will have to be signed off before March 23rd, the Uefa deadline for expressions of interest from potential host countries.Covid measuresSeparately, the Government is set to give approval on the dropping of almost all remaining Covid-19 measures.Ministers are expected to agree to recommendations by the National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) that the requirement for the compulsory wearing of face masks on public transport as well as in schools and shops can be dropped from February 28th. Nphet said last week masks should still be worn in healthcare settings and people should still be advised to wear them on public transport.Taoiseach Micheál Martin has already said the Government is following Nphet’s advice “in its entirety”.Minister for Children Roderic O’Gorman is to seek Government approval for the publication of draft legislation to allow for the exhumation of remains at the sites of former mother and baby homes.Survivors and the families of former residents are to be briefed on the contents of the Institutional Burials Bill before it is published. There is said to be “substantial changes” to a previous version of the legislation.Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue is expected to bring proposals for a €7 million support package for pig farmers to help the embattled sector, which has had to cope with rising feed and energy costs alongside a drop in the price received for pigs in the market.A support package worth about €20,000 per farmer is to be paid to all pig farmers who are members of the Bord Bia quality assurance scheme.Nuclear optionMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe will update his Cabinet colleagues on Ireland’s consideration of EU proposals to classify energy from nuclear and gas powered plants as sustainable. The controversial proposal, which is being discussed at European Council and at member state level, would see such power plants classified as “green” in guidelines for sustainable investment, but has sparked a backlash, including from some member states. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan has said there is no need to classify nuclear and gas along these lines.Mr Ryan will also bring amendments to the Road Traffic and Roads Bill that will also allow the Road Safety Authority to provide car owners with online access to their NCT data.

Photograph: Steve ParsonsPAQueen Elizabeth is experiencing “mild cold like symptoms” after testing positive for Covid-19 but expects to be at her desk carrying out “light duties”, Buckingham Palace has said.Concerns for the queen (95) will be heightened given her age and recent health scare but it appears the head of state is determined to carry out what tasks she can despite contracting the virus.The diagnosis follows a string of Covid cases among Britain’s royal family and the queen’s Windsor Castle team, with the Prince of Wales meeting the monarch the week he tested positive, and the Duchess of Cornwall also isolating after contracting the virus.The announcement was made just a few weeks after Britain’s longest-reigning monarch reached her historic Platinum Jubilee of 70 years on the throne on February 6th.Buckingham Palace said in a statement: “Buckingham Palace confirm that The Queen has today tested positive for Covid.“Her Majesty is experiencing mild cold-like symptoms but expects to continue light duties at Windsor over the coming week.“She will continue to receive medical attention and will follow all the appropriate guidelines.The royal household has its own royal physicians and the queen’s doctors will be on hand to take care of and monitor the head of state, with Professor Sir Huw Thomas, head of the medical household and physician to the queen, expected to be in charge.It is understood the queen is following Covid guidelines on self-isolating after testing positive but prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to repeal all pandemic regulations that restrict public freedoms in England when he lays out his vision for the future on Monday.The queen is believed to be triple vaccinated but until recently had been on doctors’ orders to rest since mid October, after cancelling a run of engagements and spending a night in hospital undergoing preliminary tests.Just a few weeks ago, the monarch had begun to resume her normal duties, hosting at Sandringham her largest reception in months, on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee anniversary, and a few days later held her first in-person audience with the prime minister in many weeks.The queen is believed to have spent time with Charles, Prince of Wales, on February 8, when he hosted an investiture at her Windsor Castle home, and a few days later he tested positive for Covid but made a quick recovery to full health.Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, has also tested positive for Covid, with Clarence House confirming on February 14th that the duchess was self isolating. – PAEverything you need

ireland","story":"Lord Frost called on the EU to be “sensible” last night and stop obsessing over red tape, after talks over the Northern Ireland Protocol broke up with a disagreement over olive oil shipments.The former Brexit minister criticised Brussels’ negotiators for being fixated over the “strategic risk” of everyday products being shipped to the province as Europe faces its biggest war since 1945.His intervention came after Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her EU counterpart, Maros Sefcovic, once again failed to break the deadlock in the long-running negotiations over the implementation of the post-Brexit trade rules for Northern Ireland.“At one end of our continent, the EU is working with us on great matters of war and peace, life and death,” Lord Frost said.“At the other, it is worrying about the strategic risk from olive oil.“Isn’t it time for the EU to be sensible and find a sustainable solution on the Protocol?”Britain and the EU have been locked in talks to reduce trade disruptions caused by the introduction of the Protocol, which has created a trade border in the Irish Sea.Brussels has proposed cutting the number of controls by up to 80 per cent in order to ease the burdens of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, but on Monday its negotiators raised concerns that unchecked bottles of olive oil could pose a threat to the EU Single Market. “The issue is, does the EU know what goods are coming into its Single Market,” an EU official said.But privately British negotiators said the bloc’s strategy would likely backfire, as it paints the EU as the intransigent party.A UK Government source told the : “While we’re focused on peace and stability in Northern Ireland, the EU are obsessing about types of olive oil and making themselves look unreasonable.“It misses the bigger picture and looks tone-deaf when we could be about to see a war in Eastern Europe.”Speaking after the talks, Ms Truss told Mr Sefcovic that the bloc needs to improve its offer to cut red tape, which unionists argue has driven a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.“We need to see things change on the ground, we need to see goods flow much more freely,” added the Foreign Secretary. Mr Sefcovic said it was important to rebuild UK-EU relations in order to face down the Russian threat of aggression towards Ukraine.He said: “Today’s current challenging times call, more than ever before, for a strong partnership between the EU and the UK.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we

over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain\u0027s vaccine rollout as key to restoring our liberties in full.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended.Announcing the end of legal requirements to self-isolate from Thursday and a major scaling back of free testing from April, Mr Johnson praised the extraordinary success of the vaccine rollout.He told a Downing Street press conference: Today is not the day we can declare victory over Covid, because this virus is not going away. But it is the day when all the efforts of the last two years finally enable us to protect ourselves whilst restoring our liberties in full.After two of the darkest, grimmest years in our peacetime history, I do believe this is a moment of pride for our nation.The Government’s scientific advisers on Monday said an extra spring dose will be advised for around eight million elderly and vulnerable people, with the rollout starting within weeks.The groups are also likely to be offered further doses in the autumn, the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation (JCVI) said, in a programme which could be extended far more widely – potentially to cover all over-50s.Mr Johnson set out the strategy for living with Covid after his Cabinet meeting was delayed by rows between Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the Chancellor, over funding.Sajid Javid had been pushing for more than £5 billion to maintain more free testing – including regular tests for asymptomatic NHS staff – but lost the argument, with the Department of Health told funds for remaining tests would come out of its existing budget.At the Downing Street press conference, Sir Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, the Chief Scientific Adviser, repeatedly expressed concern about who will be eligible for free tests.The Government has said the most vulnerable groups will still be able to access free tests, with suggestions that all over-80s would fall in this group.Sir Patrick said getting the definition right was critical, with Sir Chris saying a key decision was yet to be made to ensure that those who could benefit from antiviral medicine were able to get tests.But on Monday night Mr Johnson insisted people should not think there was a ision between gung-ho politicians and cautious, anxious scientists.He said Britain needed to face the fact that there could be, likely will be, another variant that will cause us trouble, adding that the sun is shining but we\u0027re keeping our umbrella in the fight against the virus, with surveillance to spot new variants and act on emerging trends.Sir Chris acknowledged that deaths were at slightly lower than average levels, pointing out that far higher numbers were now dying from causes other than Covid. He highlighted striking figures showing the impact of vaccines on hospitalisation rates.On Monday, the JCVI said it had advised ministers that a wider booster campaign in the autumn is very likely to be recommended. It may be run along the lines of the annual flu jab programme, which is aimed at around half the population, including everyone over 50.  Officials said no decision had yet been taken on the size of any autumn rollout.The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over and to care home residents from next month – around six months after their booster – with GPs and pharmacists involved in the rollout.People over 12 who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose. Over-18s will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.The boosts are being offered as a precautionary measure amid concern that immunity wanes more quickly in older and vulnerable groups. Booster jabs began to be rolled out in September, meaning it is now around five months since the programme began.Officials said the committee has provided interim advice to ministers on the rollout of jabs this autumn. It says a further booster ... is likely to be advised for people who are at higher risk of severe Covid-19.Scientists said it was too early to set out precise details of what that programme may look like, but added that it was likely to cover a wider group.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: Last year\u0027s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.Mr Javid said Britain\u0027s vaccine rollout had made it the freest country in Europe, adding that had asked the NHS to plan a further rollout of jabs in the spring following the new advice.The latest data on those aged 75 and over shows that booster jabs are 93 per cent effective against hospitalisation, and only fall to 88 per cent at 10 weeks.It follows much debate about how future rollouts of jabs should be targeted. Sir Andrew Pollard, the chairman of the JCVI, last month told The : We can\u0027t vaccinate the planet every four to six months. It\u0027s not sustainable or affordable. In the future, we need to target the vulnerable.More from NewsPolitics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Kremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fully vaccinated britons allowed europe without pre departure","story":"All fully-jabbed British travellers will be allowed into the European Union without tests under a travel blueprint to be approved by the European Council on Tuesday.Children aged six to 18 who have not been fully jabbed will also be allowed to travel into EU countries provided that they have a negative pre-departure PCR test.The plans, which will cover visitors from all non-EU countries including the UK, are designed to end the patchwork of different regulations that EU countries have used, causing confusion for many British holidaymakers.Italy and the Netherlands currently require all travellers from the UK to have a negative lateral flow or PCR test before they can enter the countries. Italy also conducts random Covid testing on arrival and demands a rapid lateral flow test on entry.The European Commission is said to be “optimistic” most EU and EEA countries will implement the new EU Council recommendation, although they are not rules so member states can deviate from them if they choose.The regime will come into effect on Mar 1, well in advance of the Easter school holidays in the first two weeks of April, and is expected to apply to all those who have been double or triple jabbed within 270 days of their arrival within the country.The 20 per cent of adults in the UK who have not had a booster will be treated as unvaccinated if they have not been double jabbed within 270 days of arrival. In Italy, this currently means five days’ self-isolation and a ban from the Netherlands.The changes will mean travel protocols from outside the EU are aligned with those within the EU, with the rules based on travellers’ personal health status rather than the epidemiological situation of the countryarea of departure.Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency said: “A one-size-fits-all policy for those who have been fully jabbed makes absolute sense and would enable European economies to bounce back faster.“The one way to revive travel across Europe is to have a consistent policy for those coming from the UK, which is a such a huge market for the EU.”Most countries are expected to retain passenger locator forms (PLFs) for arrivals, although Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is pressing to scrap the UK’s by the Easter holidays.As an interim measure the forms, in which people must provide contact and travel details, are to be significantly simplified in the coming weeks.The travel industry has been calling for the cumbersome documents to be scrapped, saying they are acting as a drag on British holiday firms.However, moves to get rid of the forms have been slowed down by objections from the Department of Health and Social Care, which has been in favour of tougher curbs.Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of trade body Airlines UK, said: “Ministers are absolutely right to remove the remaining restrictions but this needs to cut across all elements of the economy, including travel.“If there is no requirement to self-isolate for those with Covid in the UK, jabbed or otherwise, there can be no justification for continuing with travel restrictions for the unvaccinated, including the continued use of the PLF which, although not as bad as testing, remains a deterrent to travel.”The documents have already been simplified once, to shorten the time it takes to fill them in. By the end of the month, people will be given an extra day to fill them out. It is a criminal offence to provide false or deliberately misleading information when filling out the form.Unvaccinated travellers arriving in the UK will also continue to have to take pre-departure tests and PCR tests on or before day two of their entry to the UK.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lifting restrictions right thing do","story":"For a while yesterday, a delay to a Cabinet meeting called to agree an end to pandemic restrictions in England prompted speculation that Freedom Day had been put on hold. Fortunately, the concerns were misplaced. The cause was a disagreement between the Treasury and the Department of Health over funding free Covid tests after measures are lifted. Sajid Javid had reportedly requested some £5 billion to continue free testing but was rightly beaten back by the Chancellor, though help will continue for more than 1 million clinically vulnerable people and NHS staff obliged to test.One reason for seeking to “live with Covid” is to stop spending vast sums on testing mostly healthy people on a daily basis. This is money that could be spent elsewhere in the NHS without raising taxes. Ending the legal requirement to self-isolate in England from Thursday obviates the need for mass testing altogether and it is right to stop it, though why wait until April? Outside of the most vulnerable, if someone suspects they might have Covid, they can pay for a test kit to find out.In the Commons, Mr Johnson said that while Covid was now an endemic disease it should be dealt with without recourse to emergency powers, which are to be repealed early. Protection against Covid would henceforth rely on the exercise of personal responsibility, backed by vaccines and treatments. This is precisely the right, proportionate and balanced approach that we have urged on the Prime Minister for some time but one which (mostly masked) opposition MPs still could not bring themselves to support.The state cannot continue to impose restrictions on people other than in an emergency. Now that one no longer exists, Sir Keir Starmer is wrong to object when the rates of infection have fallen, hospitals are coping well and deaths are below average for the time of year. Labour seems wedded to legal compulsion for its own sake.But senseless red tape remains. For instance, restrictions on visitors to care homes are unduly onerous and should be modified. Moreover, if it is no longer mandatory to self-isolate, why do people arriving in the UK need to fill in passenger locator forms? These complicated documents act as a pointless barrier to travel which the hard-pressed tourism industry could do without.Mr Johnson hinted that they may be scrapped in time for the Easter holidays. Why wait? They should be dropped now for all the good they do.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living with covid plan strategy what when changes end","story":"Boris Johnson on Monday unveiled the Government\u0027s plans for how England will live with Covid in the future.The Prime Minister announced that all Covid regulations, including those that mandate lockdown and require people to self-isolate if they test positive, will be scrapped from Thursday, Feb 24.Here, we explore everything that is set to change in the days ahead. People who test positive and their close contacts will no longer be required by law to self-isolate. Anyone who receives a positive test result after Feb 24 will be advised to isolate for five days and avoid contact with vulnerable people, but will not be required to do.People who are unvaccinated and have come into close contact with a positive case will also no longer be required to isolate.The legal duty for workers to tell employers if they are required to self-isolate will also end, as will government financial support for people who are isolating.The Prime Minister said he would not wait for a total end to this war before lifting remaining measures, warning that to do so would involve restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time.From April 1, when the general public will no longer be able to access free tests, the guidance will change again to suggest that those with Covid symptoms should exercise caution to avoid spreading the virus. At a press conference, Mr Johnson suggested the UK could learn from Germany, where people are much more disciplined about not going to work if they are sick.From April 1, the Government will remove the Covid provisions on statutory sick pay, which allow employees to claim sick pay and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) from the first day they are not at work.From March 24, the system will return to its pre-pandemic form, which allows people to claim sick pay after four days off work and ESA after seven days.Blanket lockdown regulations will also be replaced by a requirement on local authorities to manage outbreaks through planning and pre-existing public health powers, as they would with other diseases.Mr Johnson refused to rule out reintroducing restrictions in the face of a new variant in the future, saying: You\u0027ve got to be humble in the face of nature.From Feb 24, he said the Government would end routine contact tracing and no longer ask fully vaccinated close contacts to test daily for seven days.All temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act, which enforces legal restrictions on the public, will end from March 24.The general public will no longer be able to access free lateral flow and PCR tests from the NHS from April 1.Tests are expected to be available for the over-80s and the clinically vulnerable, but the precise groups able to access them are to be decided by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) before the April 1 deadline.Care home patients will continue to get regular free asymptomatic testing and staff will be entitled to them if symptomatic. Free diagnostic testing will continue for NHS patients, with stocks available for asymptomatic “surge” testing of staff if needed.Mr Johnson told MPs the testing, tracing and isolation budget had come at a “vast cost”, exceeding the entire budget of the Home Office in 2021, a further £15.7 billion in this financial year and £2 billion in January alone at the height of the omicron wave. He said: “We must now scale this back.”Twice weekly asymptomatic testing for staff and students in most education and childcare settings will also end from April 1. Mass testing in schools is also expected to end.The UKHSA is also working with private companies to ensure that lateral flow tests will be available in supermarkets and pharmacies when they can no longer be ordered from NHS Test and Trace for free.The Government is keen to avoid a repeat of the travel test rip-offs that saw private companies charging more than £100 for PCR tests. Ministers want to ensure there is a regulated market and see no reason why a pack of six lateral flow tests should cost more than £20.In an attempt to prevent panic buying of the kits before April 1, the Government has started rationing lateral flow tests to one pack of seven tests every three days instead of one every 24 hours.Tests for symptomatic people will be free for hospital patients, but there will not be regular asymptomatic testing on wards unless there is a local outbreak.The Government will also maintain a stockpile of tests that can be deployed if a new variant threatens to overwhelm the health service.Protection against laboratory leaks will be stepped up, said Mr Johnson as he set out a strategy to future-proof Britain against another pandemic.He said the UK Biosecurity Strategy would be refreshed to shield the country against both natural spillovers and accidental releases, as well as biological threats from other countries or terrorists. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey will also remain in place to monitor the virus, and laboratories will maintain the capability to ramp up testing to combat any new variant.But Mr Johnson made it clear that Covid would now be managed through routine public health and pharmaceutical interventions as the “first line of defence”.Vaccination will also continue into the future with the UK securing supplies of new bivalent vaccines currently in trials, which can combat multiple variants in one jab.Britain will host a global pandemic preparedness summit later this month, and is expected to sign an international treaty agreeing to ongoing surveillance.Travel tests and red tape will remain despite the relaxation of domestic restrictions.Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to take a pre-departure test and pay for a PCR test on or before day two of their arrival in the UK.All travellers – jabbed and unjabbed – will also have to continue to fill in the passenger locator form to enter the UK, to the anger of many in the travel industry and Tory MPs who have campaigned for “frictionless” travel.Grant Shapps, the Transport Secretary, is expected to announce long-term plans for travel in the next month, which could see the passenger locator form further streamlined, the scrapping of hotel quarantine for red list countries and measures to prevent a return to on-off border closures.Mr Shapps has been working with other countries to draw up a “playbook” of rules to deal with new Covid strains so action can be taken without shutting frontiers.He said this “will help us to ensure that, rather than having to shut down, we can put measures in place that are internationally agreed if required”.Following the abolition of the Covid regulations, face masks will no longer be legally compulsory anywhere.Instead, it will be left up to businesses and iniduals to decide the approach they adopt, which means companies, theatres and shops could still request that coverings are worn by employees and customers.On Monday, Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, said masks would no longer be compulsory on the Tube, even though officials have the power to impose them as a condition of carriage.“Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network,” he said.A government source said it was “likely we won\u0027t be explicit” on the approach businesses should take to masks, adding: “We are now in a world where we’re moving away from Government diktat to personal judgement and responsibility.”Ministers will still suggest that people continue to wear face coverings in crowded and enclosed spaces where they may come into contact with people they do not normally meet in order to minimise the risk of infection.Dr Raghib Ali, a senior clinical research associate with the Medical Research Council at the University of Cambridge, urged vulnerable people to wear good quality surgical masks.Hospitals are still likely to limit visits, as living with Covid plans will leave it up to inidual trusts to decide their own policies.More than a quarter of NHS trusts have suspended routine hospital visits completely, and in some cases relatives are being prevented from seeing non-Covid patients for weeks at a time.NHS England encourages trusts to facilitate visits “wherever possible, and to do so in a risk-managed way”, but it is up to inidual trusts to set their own policies based on UK Health Security Agency guidelines.All 125 trusts have some form of visiting restriction in place. The most common policy is to have one named visitor per patient for the entirety of a patient’s stay, who can only visit for one hour once a dayMillions of over-50s could be offered Covid boosters this autumn, as Boris Johnson hailed Britain’s vaccine rollout as key to “restoring our liberties in full”.Fourth jabs will start being offered to those aged 75 and over and the clinically vulnerable from next month, with a further rollout of vaccines expected later this year, when the programme may be much more widely extended. The vaccine programme will see fourth jabs offered to those aged 75 and over from next month, around six months after their booster.  Those who are immunosuppressed will also be offered an extra jab, which for many will be their fifth dose.The Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation said the extra “spring dose” would be advised for the most vulnerable ahead of the expected autumn booster programme. On Monday, the JCVI said people over 75, those living in care homes and anyone over 12 who is immunosuppressed will be offered a fourth jab. Those over 18 will be offered the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines, while those 12 to 18 will be offered Pfizer.Prof Wei Shen Lim, the JCVI chairman of Covid vaccination, said: “Last year’s booster vaccination programme has so far provided excellent protection against severe Covid-19. “To maintain high levels of protection for the most vulnerable iniduals in the population, an extra spring dose of vaccine is advised ahead of an expected autumn booster programme.“The JCVI will continue its rolling review of the vaccination programme and the epidemiological situation, particularly in relation to the timing and value of doses for less vulnerable older adults and those in clinical risk groups ahead of autumn.”Mr Johnson said that from April 1 the use of voluntarily Covid status certification would no longer be recommended but left open the possibility that they could still be used by businesses, theatres and other venues.But the Government said the pass within the NHS app for domestic purposes would only be available for a “limited period”.It will, however, continue within the NHS app for international travel to allow people to declare their vaccinated or Covid recovery status.The Prime Minister suggested companies should consider lifting work from home policies to restore public confidence after the pandemic.Full guidance for businesses is expected before April 1, when tests for the general public will no longer be free. That could include the advice that offices should consider lifting their work from home policies.The Government repealed its advice for employees to work remotely last month, but official figures from the ONS show that, by the end of January, more than a third of workers were still working from home.Virtual court hearings will become a permanent feature to clear the backlog of cases that has built up during the pandemic, despite emergency Covid laws being scrapped by the Government.More than 12,000 hearings per week have taken place across 3,200 virtual courtrooms, and the power to continue them will be transferred to a new police and crime act when remaining coronavirus laws expire in the next six months.Coroners will also be given the permanent power to carry out inquests without a jury where Covid is suspected as a cause of death.In all, 40 temporary non-devolved powers were made under coronavirus laws, of which half have already expired. Of the remaining 20, four cover the inquest and virtual court hearing provisions, and the other 16 will expire at midnight on 24 March.They include the emergency registration of nurses, healthcare workers and social workers the funding of employers’ liabilities for statutory sick pay powers in relations to the transportation, storage and disposal of dead bodies tenants’ protection from eviction and the relaxing of rules covering medical certificates for cremations.This article is being kept updated with the latest news and advice. More from NewsPolitics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Kremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"putins aim clear","story":"Vladimir Putin’s decision to recognise the eastern Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent republics marks a significant heightening of tensions between Moscow and the West. The Russian leader had earlier staged an absurd propaganda stunt by chairing a televised meeting of his security council to endorse this demarche. It has removed all remaining doubt as to his intentions to further carve up Ukraine in breach of international law.The announcement has scuppered the latest flurry of diplomatic efforts spearheaded by Emmanuel Macron, who has failed to engineer the resolution to the crisis that he confidently predicted just a week or so. France currently holds the rotating EU presidency offering Mr Macron the chance to play the roles of statesman and peace-maker. He has been trying to bring the Russian leader together with US president Joe Biden in a last-ditch effort to prevent an invasion.But while Mr Biden had agreed in principle to a summit, the latest development has surely killed off any hopes of a rapprochement.While a diplomatic solution is preferable to war, it cannot be at any price, as Ben Wallace, the Defence Secretary, told MPs. The West must not support the dismantling of Ukraine in order to persuade Mr Putin to remove his troops.The provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk have been at the centre of a bloody stand-off between the two countries since 2014 that has already cost 10,000 lives. If Mr Putin can split them from Ukraine, as he did Crimea, he will consider his acts of intimidation and aggression to have been a success. But he will come back for more, with the Baltic states next on his list.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sir paul mccartney set become glastonburys oldest headline act","story":"Sir Paul McCartney will become the oldest artist to headline Glastonbury when he plays the festival this summer, a week after turning 80.The singer is reportedly booked for the Pyramid stage on June 25, a week after celebrating his landmark birthday.He was due to headline the festival in 2020 but it was cancelled due to Covid. Before the cancellation Emily Eavis, the event organiser, described booking Sir Paul as “an absolute dream come true”.Sir Paul said at the time that the cancellation was the right thing to do. “One hundred thousand people closely packed together with flags and no masks - you know, talk about super-spreader,” he said.Glastonbury has not confirmed the line-up, but representatives for Sir Paul did not deny reports that he will be this year’s star name. The star recently announced a string of US dates for his Got Back tour, ending in New Jersey on June 16.Sir Paul has headlined Glastonbury once before, in 2004, when he played a 33-strong set which included a tribute to John Lennon.Although he will set a record for the oldest headline act, he is not the oldest performer to grace the festival in Pilton, Somerset.In 2015, Burt Bacharach played the Saturday afternoon Legends slot at the age of 87. BB King was 85 when he performed in 2011.The record for oldest Glastonbury headliner was last set by Charlie Watts, who was 73 when the Rolling Stones played the festival in 2013.Mr Watts was less enthusiastic about the event than Sir Paul, telling one interviewer: “I don’t want to do it. I don’t like playing outdoors and I certainly don’t like festivals.“Glastonbury, it’s old hat, really. I never liked the hippie thing to start with.”Ms Eavis, who runs the festival with her father, Michael, said last year that they planned to “throw everything at 2022” and make this year’s event one to remember.Cancelling the 2020 festival, which was the 50th anniversary year, cost the Eavises £5 million. Last year, they staged a five-hour, live streamed concert from Worthy Farm in an attempt to make up some of the lost revenue.More from NewsPolitics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Kremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uh oh curling get hipster makeover","story":"Less than 48 hours after Team GB took home gold and silver medals in curling, I gingerly step onto the ice, kneel down, and heave an enormous stone as far as I can. It glides along nicely for a few yards, then skitters and gives up about a third of the way to the target. It turns out that curling, which I had long believed to be as taxing as bowls and as serious as hopscotch, is actually very difficult. I’m not alone in coming to the sport now: rinks are booked up after millions tuned in to watch the GB women’s team win gold and the men win silver at the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Ice rinks are being urged to stock up on curling stones, in anticipation of a post-Olympics boom in interest, and venues are reportedly booked up. “Our sessions are almost sold out for the next two weeks”, the manager of one of England’s biggest curling rinks told The . I head to Queens, a rink in central London, which over the past few years has been trying to reinvigorate the sport by giving it a hipster makeover. While the sport might be commonly thought of as something for the older generation, Queens is taking efforts to make it appeal to younger people. The walls are decorated with false graffiti and sports memorabilia, and the rink is ringed by a bar selling craft beer.I tack grips onto the bottom of my trainers, and have 19-year-old curler Leo De Souza explain how to wang the 44lb (20kg) granite stone as far as I can. He explains that I need to “push right until the end”, ending with a flick of the wrist. I give it a try, bracing my core and using the strength of my entire body to move the stone forwards. The stone races on, as does my heart rate. The sport might have experienced a recent surge in popularity, but it has been played for at least 500 years in some form. It emerged in Scotland in the 16th century, where people played on frozen ponds and lochs, and soon spread to continental Europe. Its rules were codified in their current form by the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, Stirling, in the mid-19th century.This year isn’t the first time that Team GB has taken home a haul of curling medals. At the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the women’s team took home gold medals after delivering “the Stone of Destiny” that gave Team GB their first Winter Olympics gold for almost two decades. After their success, they were mobbed at the airport on their arrival home, and overnight became household names.Its ongoing popularity over the past half-millennium has undoubtedly been helped by its unique blend of physical strength and mental tactics. Curling is frequently called “chess on ice” due to the intricate turn-based tactics you need to succeed, which vary wildly based on whether your team starts first or second. Just like in chess, your stones will be either used to attack, or to protect your attacking stones from the other team, explains Stephen Lea, a 50-year-old IT manager from Tunbridge Wells who has been curling for a decade. If your team goes first, then you typically try to throw “guard” stones which block the other team from approaching the house, whereas the team who goes second will prefer to “keep the centre of the house open”. “It’s very much like chess”, he says. “There are all types of plays that different teams do.” But with hip rinks like Queens now offering curling, will the image of the sport undergo a bit of an image rehaul? It’s not the first old-fashioned sport to be folded into the trend for “competitive socialising”: Flight Club is a chain of bars across the country where groups of punters can enjoy cocktails while they play darts, and in Australia there’s even a place where you can do boozy lawn bowls. “We looked at curling as bowling’s wonderful, weird cousin”, says Dan Kapp, the marketing director of Queens. “It’s nicely social… People are craving experiences after being stuck behind a screen for two years, and it provides sensational Instagram content.”He says that the professional curling bodies have been very welcoming to the informal game they’re playing at Queens, with a shorter rink than they use in the Olympics, and plenty of drinks after. And there might be a reason for that: even in the competitive sport, a tournament always ends in the bar, says Lea: “It’s a very social game the winner buys the loser drinks”.Bad news for Team GB, then: that’s one hell of a bar tab. More from NewsPolitics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Kremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rural report eye storm eunice","story":"When you are young, power cuts are fun. I have happy 1970s boarding-school memories of messing around with candles when Edward Heath’s disputes with the trade unions plunged us into darkness.Even today, I feel a ghost of the old pleasure. When Storm Eunice hit us in Sussex on Friday morning, I was quite excited. When our power cut out, I was about half-way through my Saturday column for this paper and completed it with the residue left in my laptop. As well as no electricity, I had no mobile signal and no internet, but through my landline I was able to reach the ’s Comment desk to discuss how to transmit my piece. Since all power for miles around was out, I could not cadge anyone else’s connection.The only solution was the most old-fashioned: dictation. The brilliant Madeline Grant is an accomplished young writer with better things to do, but she patiently typed up my fulminations against President Putin and the weakness of the West.For me, dictating was nostalgic. Before fax machines in the 1980s, phoning over copy (always reversing the telephone charges) was the main method for journalists out on a story. Those scenes in old films of reporters fighting for a telephone box were authentic. The temperature in our house was dropping fast, but my triumph over minor adversity gave me a warm glow.Dinner was hot – no interruption of our bottled gas – and our log fire and candles made one room snug. Our last view from our bedroom window before an early night was memorably lovely. The utter absence of unnatural light enabled us to marvel at the perfected brightness of the moon.Escape from modernity is enjoyable, however, only if you can get back to it when you want to. We could not. The power was still off the next morning. I began to consider the facts.My mother was worst placed. She is a former polio victim who is about to be 90, lives alone and is immobile. Helped by extremely kind neighbours, she survived the first night well, but began to get cold the next day. Because of her infirmity, she cannot light or tend a log fire.The main worry was her stairlift. It has a back-up which can make a limited number of journeys in a power-cut, but not enough to survive a prolonged one. I supervised her journey up to bed lest the lift fail, leaving my mother in the air. It was cold, but at least I could give her a hot-water bottle. Thank God for non-electric Agas.By Sunday, the situation began to feel like the plagues of Egypt. All power was still off. My wife had caught the local flu and was sick in the night. My mother woke to find she had no water of any kind, hot or cold. The whole town of Battle was in the same situation, we heard. Without power, the water pumping station was not working properly.Visiting my mother in the morning, I was touched to find the kind neighbours with her, accompanied by the local farmer, James. He was installing his generator to help her, passing the wire through the letter-box, carefully putting it under carpets so she couldn’t trip. Its tankful powered two lights, the fridge and one blow heater for several hours. But it could not revive the stairlift, which is hardwired.I returned in the early evening to give my mother her supper and get her up to bed. Her village still had no power, and the stairlift had finally given up. It would have been nice to stay downstairs, but her electrically-operated chair for the disabled which can keep the sitter comfortable by adopting different positions was, naturally, dead.We decided to climb the stairs. Since my mother’s legs cannot support her, I was all but carrying her. It was slow and painful work, stair-tread by stair-tread. The whole process, from the bottom of the stairlift to getting her safely tucked up in bed, took well over an hour.As I write, 4,400 homes in Sussex are still without power. I have just left after giving my mother breakfast, still upstairs. She and I agreed that she should stay put, partly because she might fall coming down, mainly because of the ordeal of getting up the stairs again later. There is no solution until the power returns. A carer is with her, and my brother is nobly coming from London later. My poor sister has now tested positive for Covid.My mother has gamely overcome many adversities in life, but even she is a bit shaken. We all feel slightly embarrassed. After all, the absence of electricity was something familiar to most people 70 years ago.Yet it has become so embedded in daily life that we can barely live without it for more than 24 hours. The authorities need to acknowledge this, and find quicker ways of restoring heat and light.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Russia dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russians have invaded ski haven courchevel like last days saigon","story":"There are benefits to being a Russian speaker: eavesdropping, for one. As we boarded our flight to Geneva last week, I couldn’t help but listen in to the conversation between two blondes in the row before us. They were heading to Courchevel, but I could have guessed that from their Fendi moon boots and Chanel Shearling backpacks. As they were flying British Airways (and not NetJets), I suspected these Russian ladies weren’t oligarch wives, but mistresses – or plain-old escorts.What was clear from their chatter was they were going to Courchevel to party. You would have thought, what with the TV constantly showing images of Russian tanks lining up along Ukraine’s borders, that they might want to hide in their bomb-proof Holland Park basements, clutching the business card of their Credit Suisse bankers. Talk of war, sanctions and repercussions didn’t seem to faze this lot one little bit.Maybe it’s because according to Rupert Longsdon, of the Oxford Ski Company – who rents chalets in Courchevel for up to €300,000 (£250,000) a week – these are “international Russians”. I presume many ‘Russian-Russians’ still can’t travel abroad much, not least because the EU doesn’t accept their ‘Sputnik’ vaccine. (Instead, they reportedly flock to Serbia – which allows visa-free travel from Russia – to access Western-made Covid jabs.)Christmas and January should be peak skiing months for Russians: February is when the Globo-Russians, many of whom reside in London, arrive at the Alpine resorts.At Le Cap Horn in Courchevel – sits oldest mountain restaurant, which is party central for Russians and where you’re expected to tip in gold bullion – ladies danced on tables in clearly never-worn-before Prada and Chloé ski suits as their hosts swigged down Dom Pérignon. “There we were, checking our phones for updates on the Ukraine crisis, while the Russians partied like Rome was burning,” says a friend.To give you even more of an idea, Le Cap Horn has a gift shop that sells Hermès handbags. “At one point, a Russian man appeared handing them out to the girls dancing on tables, who way outnumbered the men,” they add. “Lots of people were taping them, but they didn’t seem to care.”Le Cap Horn’s seafood-and-sushi menu is printed in French and Russian. If like us, you are English-speaking, regular guests, you can now expect to be seated by the loo – if they bother taking your reservation at all. The last time we were at the restaurant, five years ago, my husband paid in hundred euro bills and asked for change. The waiter laughed.Courchevel has long been the resort of choice for Russian billionaires. Roman Abramovich led the way, and others followed – most notably entrepreneurs Vladimir Potanin and Mikhail Prokhorov. Courchevel has been nicknamed “Courchevelsky”.“It’s hard to find a place to park your private jet these days,” says Longsdon, who explains that Courchevel is now the place to be for Russians for two reasons. One: they don’t have to rent their chalets out (as you do by law in, say, Austria, to maintain the community). And two: ski resorts is where “business is done”.“A lot people meet in private chalets, where they are not overheard,” he says. “They can sit down with clients at a table and talk openly.” Such privacy cannot be assured in a Russian dacha. I’ve heard many stories. One Russian family apparently rented puppies for their children as a Christmas gift, requiring redecorating a room with astroturf, and full-time dog trainers at £3,000 per day.Another chalet was the scene of a spontaneous drunken egg-and-pan baseball game, resulting in more than £25,000 worth of damage. Staff put up with it because the tips are the same as they are on yachts – namely, 10 per cent of what the chalet cost to rent, though Russians tip twice the going rate.According to another eyewitness at the resort for half-term, “it was crazy”. Writer Rhymer Rigby, who was staying in the nearby La Tania, where oligarchs helicopter in for lunch, says: “I saw a Louis Vuitton-branded yurt from my Gucci-branded gondola.”Notable also was how many fur-clad Russian ladies had their own photographers in tow. “The outfits were particularly good this year,” says a PR friend, whose family own a chalet. “Very Instagrammy.” Maybe they want to make memories before their foreign assets are frozen and, as some MPs have suggested, their children thrown out of British boarding schools.Courchevel was “our resort” for more than a decade, until Abramovich and his entourage alighted upon it (he apparently viewed every chalet in town, bidding way above the asking price, thereby fixing prices at oligarch levels. He also owns a chalet in Aspen, I’m told.)Our hotel in Courchevel was a favourite half-term destination. A British ski company looked after the children, allowing us to spend hours watching the (then) beautiful people at Le Cap Horn.Within a few years, we noticed that our hotel was filling up with loud, wealthy Russians, who booked a guide for each member of the family and kept them waiting all day in the ski room (no apology), while they nursed hangovers in their penthouse suites.Then restaurants began printing menus in Russians at the same time as prices doubled. Stories of hookers soon followed. You didn’t need a translator then (or now) to figure out what all well-endowed ladies hanging out in the lobbies of the highest-end hotels were up to.Courchevel boasts many British regulars, including David Beckham, who was there recently – but, truth be told, it’s a segregated resort now. “We never go to the big restaurants on the piste, and we never go into town because it’s ridiculous,” says a designer friend, who has been skiing there since she was four. “We would never go out at night, that’s for sure – and we can’t afford it. We spend the whole week avoiding the Russians.”This year, with kids in tow, we tried a new French resort, Val-d’Isère, with a Courchevel refugee as our guide. “The Russians have ruined Courchevel,” he says. “But their children are coming here. They are less showy – and sportier.”Judging from the mother of enormous chalets that was being constructed behind ours, and the rapidly expanding five-star hotel scene, surely it’s only a matter of time before it becomes “Valsidreski”.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"urban hedgehogs faring better country cousins","story":"At the end of Aesop\u0027s famous story, the country mouse flees the city for the safety of his rural idyll - but for the country hedgehog, the story would have a very different conclusion.Hedgehog populations have plummeted across the countryside since the turn of the century, but urban animals are faring better than their rural cousins, data shows.The latest State Of Britain\u0027s Hedgehogs report warns that between 30 per cent and 75 per cent of the population has been lost in rural areas in the past 20 years, with declines varying between regions and the largest falls in the eastern half of England.But there is a more hopeful picture for the animals in towns and cities, where a stable population might be recovering thanks to help from considerate gardeners and animal lovers, the report from conservation charities suggests.Analysis by the People\u0027s Trust for Endangered Species (PTES) and the British Hedgehog Preservation Society (BHPS) draws on a number of surveys carried out in rural and urban areas, and is the first to be released in four years.Records include citizen science recording schemes, animal road casualty records, and reports of accidental kills by gamekeepers.Data from 1981 to 2020 shows that hedgehogs have undergone long historic declines, but now the differing fortunes of rural and urban populations are becoming increasingly obvious.While the first State Of Britain\u0027s Hedgehogs report in 2011 estimated that a quarter of the population in urban areas had been lost in the first decade of the century, the latest data shows no evidence that the decline has continued.Rather, in cities and towns, the data suggests a a stable population that might be recovering and paints an encouraging picture for the city-dwelling animals.Data from the British Trust for Ornithology\u0027s Garden Birdwatch, where mammals can also be recorded as an option, suggests a falling trend until 2013 but then rising numbers, while data from the PTES Living with Mammals suggests that a decline has levelled off.BHPS chief executive Fay Vass said: “Greater awareness, and inidual and community actions, such as making gardens more hedgehog friendly, may be starting to help urban hedgehogs.However, urgent action is needed to understand why rural areas are no longer suitable for hedgehogs and how conservationists, farmers and land managers can work together to prevent hedgehogs from becoming extinct in the countryside.”Nida Al-Fulaij, conservation research manager at PTES and one of the report\u0027s authors, said the charity was alarmed at what was happening in rural areas and wanted to work with farmers to make landscapes more hedgehog friendly.If you picture a landscape, the greater mosaic of different habitats and varied features, and varied species within those features, the better it is not just for hedgehogs but for everything, she said.Getting hedgerows, the habitat that gives hedgehogs their name, into good condition would help, providing more and thicker hedges for food and cover, with different species such as broadleaf trees for leaves they can nest in, Ms Al-Fulaij said.Hedgehogs will also benefit from field margins that are not sprayed so there is a supply of food such as slugs, caterpillars and bugs.The crucial thing will be to increase the food availability and nesting and forage availability across the landscape.Ms Al-Fulaij said the wildlife charity supports moves to fund hedgerow creation as part of the new farming payments scheme, but warned there is also a need to make sure existing hedges are in good condition.Action is also still needed in towns and cities, where householders are advised to provide access through fences and make their gardens suitable for hedgehogs. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Kremlin dismisses threat of sanctions, saying \u0026#39we are used to it\u0026#39Politics latest news: People should no longer battle into work with cold symptoms, suggests Sajid JavidKremlin weighs up claiming more Ukrainian territoryPictured: Female passenger killed in London during storm Eunice when tree crushed carUkraine: How the world reacted to Vladimir Putin\u0026#39s speechIronbridge residents \u0026#39staying put\u0026#39 despite danger to life flood warningMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid rule changes set announced","story":"All the Covid rule changes set to be announced by Boris Johnson TODAY as isolation axedCovid isolation rule changes and the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed are likely in Boris Johnson’s ‘living with Covid’ plan, due to be published today.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Speaking before his announcement on Monday, the Prime Minister said: Today will mark a moment of pride after one of the most dficult periods in our countryaposs history as we begin to learn to live with Covid. It would not be possible without the efforts of so many - the NHS who delivered the le-saving vaccine rollout at phenomenal speed, our world-leading scientists and experts, and the general public for their commitment to protecting themselves and their loved ones. The pandemic is not over but thanks to the incredible vaccine rollout we are now one step closer towards ato normality and finally giving people back their freedoms while continuing to protect ourselves and others.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The Electoral Commission urged the government to axe parts of the Elections Bill, which it says will allow governments to muzzle the independent regulator and influence its “operational s and decision-making” and. In a letter to the Levelling Up Secretary on Monday, commissioners warn the introduction of a new “strategy and policy statement” for the watchdog gives ministers power over “oversight and enforcement of the political finance regime” and the guidance to political parties and campaigners.It comes after an Electoral Commission investigation resulted in the Conservative Party being fined £, for failing to properly declare a Tory peer’s £, donation to cover lavish refurbishments to the Prime Minister’s Downing Street flat.“It would thereby provide a mechanism, driven by the then governing party, enabling that party’s ministers to shape how electoral law is applied to them and their political competitors,” the commissioners said of the new policy statement.  “While the stated position of the current government is that it would not intend to use these powers to impact on the commission’s independent oversight and regulation of the electoral system, no such assurances can be given about how the broad scope of these powers would be used over time. “Strong accountability is essential for this, but so too is demonstrable independence. The commission’s independent role in the electoral system must be clear for voters and campaigners to see, and preserved in electoral law.”Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner, meanwhile, accused Boris Johnson of “rigging our democracy for himself”.The letter – signed by nine of  of the commissioners, less Tory-nominated Lord Gilbert due to his role in the Lords – urged ministers to “think again about these measures” and to “remove the provisions” under question. Ms Rayner said: “The Elections Bill is anti-democratic in so many ways. “Attacking institutions, allowing unchecked foreign money into British democracy, and disenfranchising so many people. “Boris Johnson is rigging our democracy for himself.” The legislation, which also includes controversial plans to introduce voter ID, has been backed by MPs and will this week be debated by the House of Lords. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: “We completely disagree with the Electoral Commission’s claims about the Elections Bill - our reforms will not affect their operational independence.“The Pickles review on electoral fraud was clear that reforms were needed to improve accountability. Making the Electoral Commission more accountable will strengthen the integrity of the electoral process and help prevent fraud.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Electoral CommissionConservative PartyBoris JohnsonMichael GovePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

We are also ready to impose swt and severe consequences should Russia instead choose war. The Kremlin said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Mr Biden could set up a call or meeting at any time but there were no firm plans yet for a summit.  It comes following a flurry of late-night calls between French President Emmanuel Macron and Mr Putin. Mr Macronaposs office and the White House said details of a possible summit could be hammered out during a meeting on Thursday between US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The development offers a glimmer of hope of a diplomatic solution but Western leaders still fear a Russian invasion of Ukraine could be imminent.More than , Russian troops are massed around Ukraineaposs borders, according to US estimates, with , along the countryaposs eastern flank and tens of thousands alongside Belarusian troops in the north.Fears have been mounting that Russia will stage  flag attacks to justy further aggression against Ukraine. A UK source told the Mirror that they believed an invasion was going to happen in the next  to  hours.  Boris Johnson warned at the weekend that Europe could be on the brink of the biggest war since  as he travelled to Munich for a crunch security conference.In a call with Mr Macron on Sunday night, the Prime Minister welcomed the prospect of a diplomatic solution and urged Mr Putin to step back from his current threats and withdraw troops from Ukraine’s border. A No spokesperson said: “The Prime Minister noted that President Putin’s commitments to President Macron were a welcome sign that he might still be willing to engage in finding a diplomatic solution. The Prime Minister stressed that Ukraine’s voice must be central in any discussions. Tory Minister Paul Scully said there were , more Russian troops on the Ukrainian border than there were a few days ago despite the Russians trying to signal the fact they were pulling away from the border.He told Sky News: There is a very, very credible threat and thataposs why weaposve got to continue to be vigilant, weaposve got to continue to work with Ukraine and Poland, as Liz Truss, the Foreign Secretary, was doing just this week. He warned the loss of le will be horrendousRussian fails to engage in diplomacy. Mr Scully denied that Mr Macron had been more effective in tackling the Ukraine crisis than the Prime Minister, saying Mr Johnson had been on the front foot in addressing the rising tensions. Itaposs important that every member of Nato collaborate and work together, as they are, to make sure that Vladimir Putin realises that he needs to go down the diplomatic route and retreat from the border, he told TALKRadio.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace will take questions in the Commons on Monday afternoon.Russia and ally Belarus said they were extending war games on Belarusian territory that would offer a convenient staging post on Ukrainian capital Kyiv, less than  miles south of the border with Belarus.

Mandatory self-isolation will be axed from Thursday, £ isolation payments and Day One sick pay will go, and free tests will be axed from April  - with a -hour limit already in place to stop stockpiling. The Prime Minister said testing, tracing and isolation cost £bn in January alone adding: Those who would wait for a total end to this war... would be restricting the liberties of the British people for a long time to come.But the SNP said he was scrambling to save his own skin from Tory MPs angry about Partygate, while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: This is a half-baked announcement from a Government paralysed by chaos and incompetence.It is not a plan to live well with Covid.Phillip Anderson, Head of Policy at the MS Society, warned over , immunocompromised people do not know how they can live safely alongside the virus.Lobby Akinnola, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: People will die directly because of the decision to scrap free testing, and those deaths are avoidable. Just as the Government was late starting testing, costing thousands of lives, they are going to be too early finishing it, with the same consequence.The Scottish and Welsh governments are furious as No confirmed neither they, nor the NHS in England, will get new money for testing beyond April.The refusal to give any extra money prompted a last-minute delay to the plan after a row at the highest levels of government. Hereaposs what was announced today and what it means for you.February : Testing advice ends in schoolsEngland’s guidance for staff and students in schools to do regular lateral flow testing is being removed immediately. They may remain for some settings like special schools but details were not immediately available. Guidance previously said: Staff and secondary school pupils should continue to test twice weekly at home, with lateral flow devicetest kits, - days apart. Testing remains voluntary but is strongly encouraged. February : Limit on how many tests you can getAs of today you can no longer get more than one box of lateral flow tests in a -hour period. It was previously a  hour period. This is to stop a rush of people stockpiling them before April , when free tests end .February : Self-isolation laws scrappedMandatory Covid self-isolation in England will be scrapped - evenyou have the virus - from .am on Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. The legal obligation to tell your employeryou have to self-isolate will also end.But adults and children will still beadvisedto stay at homethey test positive.Between Thursday and the end of March, youaposll be advised to isolate for five days as long as you test negative twice,  hours apart at the end of that period - as is the case now. New advicewill apply from April . That raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especially as you can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No earlier said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. February : Close contacts no longer have to test or isolateThe government will no longer ask vaccinated or child contacts of Covid cases in England to test themselves for  days. It will also remove the legal requirement for unvaccinated close contacts to self isolate, all from .am on Thursday.February : £ self-isolation payment scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid will end from .am on Thursday.The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. Unions and Labour are worried its removal will force people to go to work, putting their colleagues at risk of infection.The medicine delivery service will no longer be available. February : Routine contact-tracing and council powers endRoutine contact-tracing will end in England as the UKaposs infrastructure for dealing with Covid is wound down. So will a set of domestic laws - the Health Protectionregulations - which gave councils powers to enact closures in their area.March : Sick pay and ESA from day one will endPeople who fall ill with Covid will no longer be eligible for immediate aposDay Oneapos sick pay from March . The law willto how it was before Covid, where you donapost get SSP for the first three days youaposre ill and only get it from Day Four. The same will happen to Employment and Support Allowancewhich willfrom Day One to Day Eight. People will no longer be eligible for ESAisolating due to Covid. Itaposs despite widespread calls for the Government to boost statutory sick pay - which is currently £.-a-week - so those struggling financially are not tempted to go back to work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The government is creating needless hardship and taking a sledgehammer to public health. The failure to provide decent sick pay to all – from the first day of illness - is reckless and self-defeating. Dan Shears of the GMB union said: “Today’s nonsensical announcement guarantees workers will attend the workplace with Covid. Restoring the three day limit is an act of national self-sabotage.April : Free lateral flow tests for the general public will endFrom April  the vast majority of people must paythey want a lateral flow test - eventhey have a cough and fever. No has said spending £bn a month on free tests is not an effective use of taxpayers’ money at this point. This has prompted a furious row with Labour, some medics and the Scottish and Welsh governments - which will get no new moneythey want to continue free tests. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but No is seeking a regulated market where each test costs a low single-figure number of pounds. This suggests a box of seven could cost £-.Asymptomatic tests for NHS workers will be made available but not routinely, only as a surge effort where thereaposs an outbreak. But they will be available for care home residents. Exact lists of those eligible are being drawn up.UNISON general secretary Christina McAnea said: “The government has taken leave of its senses. Ditching every last Covid safety rule while thousands are still catching the virus every day is irresponsible. “Ending free tests for the public is a foolish move. Most people will simply stop testing because they can’t afford to check their Covid status. April : Free PCR tests will end for the vast majorityThe capacity to do hundreds of thousands of aposgold standardapos PCR tests a day will be wound down dramatically from April  in England. Youaposll no longer be able to order a free PCRyou have symptoms and go to a walk-in or drive-through centre, or get it in the post. There will be some exceptions to this, including the over-s, the immunosuppressed, and patients on NHS wards. Exact lists of those eligible are still being drawn up. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. Some of the UKaposs lab capacity for PCR tests will be maintained, but not all of it. UKHSA are determining precisely what right level is, to ensure there’s enough to scale upthere’s a new iant. The network of testing centres is already being scaled back and will continue to be reduced. April : New guidance for workplaces and Covid passes wound downThe legal need for firms to consider Covid- in risk assessments will be removed, except- for example - they are a lab that handles the virus. The Government will replace the existing set of ‘Working Safely’ guidance with new public health guidance. The plan says: Employers should continue to consider the needs of employees at greater risk from COVID-, including those whose immune system means they are at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-. The Government will consult with employers and businesses to ensure guidance continues to support them to manage the risk of COVID- in workplaces. The plan adds: From  April, the Government will remove the current guidance on domestic voluntary COVID-status certication and will no longer recommend that certain venues use the NHS COVID Pass. The NHS COVID Pass will remain available within the NHS App for a limited period. People will continue to be able to access their vaccination status for international travel.Date TBC: End of mandatory masks on Londonaposs public transport London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he expects rules on wearing face coverings on the Transport for London network will be lted following the Governmentaposs announcements.Following the Government dropping all legal Covid restrictions, and in light of falling infection levels in London, it is expected that wearing a face covering will no longer be a condition of carriage on the TfL network, he said. However, we know that face coverings remain a simple, effective measure that give Londoners confidence to travel, and following clear advice from public health advisers, TfL will likely continue to recommend their use on the network.Staying in place: Covid travel rules Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and no further changes have been announced today. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. But this has not yet come to pass. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. There will be a review of these rules before Easter.  Staying in place: Surveillance and surge powersOfficials said the government will maintain strong domestic surveillance, including the ONS Covid infection survey to spot new iants, and the Siren and Vivaldi studies.There will also be measures to ramp up testing in the NHSneeded in future. SAGE experts have already warned a new iant could be more deadly than the original form of Covid - rather than less deadly, like Omicron. From Spring: A fourth dose of vaccine for over-s and the vulnerablePeople over  and the clinically vulnerable will be offered another Covid jab from the Spring. A second booster jab has been recommended for over-s by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation , which applies to around . million people. It will also be offered to around , immunosuppressed people, some of whom have already had a third dose and a booster. Anyone eligible can come forward to get another vaccine regardless of whether they have had three of four doses - as long as there has been a six month gap since their last jab. Vaccine experts are also planning for a wider booster programme for more of the population in the autumn. The JCVI said it will confirm which sections of the population would qualy for this nearer the time.Health Secretary Sajid Javid has accepted the recommendations for fourth doses, which is a “precautionary strategy to maintain high levels of immunity”.The extra spring dose is advised around six months after the last vaccine dose for over-s, those living in an elderly care home and anyone aged over  who is immunosuppressed.From April: Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

But Downing Street brushed off calls for a national apologyChristmas Island during the biggest nuclear bomb tests Image: Sunday MirrorBySusie BonaceBen GlazeDeputy Political EditorDan Bloom:,  Feb |comments The government has U-turned on a medal for survivors of Britainaposs nuclear tests following demands from Labour to end the -year scandal. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace told the Commons yesterday that he had ordered his officials to review the earlier decision by a discredited medal committee not to award a gong.The move came just three hours after the Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman brushed off calls for a national apology to mark the th anniversary of Britainaposs first bomb test later this year. The chaotic scenes followed the Mirroraposs report yesterday of Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham telling veterans they were victims of the greatest injustice of them all. He said: The Prime Minister of this country, whoever that is at the time that it needs to be done, needs to stand at the despatch box in the House of Commons and make a national apology to each and every one of you, and every member of your families. Labour also called for medals, a full compensation package, NHS priority treatment, and medical research into the litany of ill health reported by test veterans and their families.Yesterday lunchtime, the PMaposs spokesman shrugged off any suggestion of an apology, telling the Mirror: These veterans played a valuable role towards developing a nuclear deterrent that has ultimately kept Britain safe for decades. “The protection, health and welfare of those involved in the nuclear testing operations is a vital consideration, as shown by the detailed, documented safety measures and radio-biological monitoring that took place during operations. “When it comes to medals, thataposs a matter for the Advisory Military Sub-Committee which takes those issues into account.” Asked about compensation, the spokesman said: “I’m not aware of any plans along those lines.”  We reported last week how the AMSC has refused gongs to five dferent groups of veterans in the past two years, while its members have been decorated for non-risky service that included charity work, organising the Invictus Games, and running Whitehall budgets. It has refused a service medal for the nuclear tests three times, claiming there was not enough risk and rigour to them. But the government changed its tone later in the afternoon, when Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Denton and Reddish, asked the Commons: The UK is now the only atomic nation with no official recognition or compensation to nuclear test veterans and their families. Ahead of the th anniversary of the first British nuclear test later this year, will ministers now do the right thing and give those veterans the recognition they deserve  Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, a former captain in the Scots Guards, replied: I hear what the honourable gentleman says and I absolutely recognise that we are now the last country to do so. The recent, the last internal review was in December, Iaposve asked officials to go back and look at that again.  He later told MPs that he could not personally order a medal himself. The Mirror has campaigned for justice for survivors of the nuclear tests for more than  years. Successive governments have refused to compensate them, and no PM since Winston Churchill ordered the first test in  has ever met them. Boris Johnson promised to meet them in November, but has yet to find time to meet them in Downing Street.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

Here is the latest data: Infections Around one in  people in private households in England had Covid- in the week to February , or . million people, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics . This is down from one in , or . million people, in the week to February . Infections are still higher than they were before Christmas, when the estimate stood at one in , or two million people. But levels have fallen since the peak of the Omicron wave at the start of the year, when a record one in  in England had Covid- - the equivalent of . million people.The ONS infection survey is the most reliable measure of the prevalence of coronavirus across the country. It is based on a representative sample of swab tests collected from tens of thousands of households, and is therefore able to estimate the percentage of people likely to test positive for Covid- at any one point in time - regardless of when they caught the virus, how many times they have had it and whether they have symptoms. By contrast, the number of cases of Covid- announced each day by the Government counts only those people who have reported themselves as testing positive for the virus, and as such is affected by how many people are coming forward for tests or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. Hospital patients Although infections in England hit a record high during the recent Omicron surge, the number of people in hospital with Covid- never came close to matching levels seen in the second wave of the virus a year ago.Patient numbers reached , on January   - around a half the , recorded on January   at the peak of the second wave, according to NHS England figures.The total currently stands at ,, having fallen by  per cent in the past week and down  per cent from the Omicron peak. An estimated , Covid- hospital admissions among people aged  and over were prevented in England between December   and February   due to the direct effect of the booster vaccination campaign, according to the UK Health Security Agency.  Just over half of all Covid- patients in hospital trusts in England are now being treated primarily for something , up from a quarter in the autumn of last year. All patients who have tested positive for Covid- need to be treated separately from those who do not have the virus, regardless of whether they are in hospital primarily for Covid or not. But the growing proportion of patients who are in hospital with Covid- rather than for Covid- is another sign that the current wave of the virus has not led to the same sort of pressure on critical care as in previous waves. Antibodies An estimated . per cent of people aged  and over in England were likely to have Covid- antibodies in the week ending January  , according to the ONS. This is up from . per cent six months earlier and just  per cent in mid-January . The presence of Covid- antibodies suggests someone has had the infection in the past or has been vaccinated. It takes between two and three weeks after infection - or vaccination - for the human body to make enough antibodies to fight the virus.  Antibodies then remain in the blood at low levels, although these levels can decline over time to the point where tests can no longer detect them. The latest ONS figure of . per cent is the highest since estimates began in December  and is likely to reflect both the impact of the vaccination rollout and the high prevalence of Covid- in recent months. Some . per cent of children in England aged  to  are also estimated to have antibodies, along with . per cent of eight to -year-olds. Only a tiny number of children aged eight to  outside clinical trials had received any Covid- vaccine at the time the estimates were made, meaning almost everyone in this age group with antibodies will have them due to a coronavirus infection. By contrast, first doses of Covid- vaccine have been available for  to -year-olds in England since September last year, with jabs being offered in schools as well as local vaccination centres. Vaccinations Take-up of Covid- vaccines in England has always ied across dferent age groups and this remains the case in the latest available Government figures. Around nine in  adults aged  and over have received at least three doses of vaccine. The proportion then falls as the age groups get younger.  Take-up of boosters or third doses of vaccine has yet to reach  per cent among any group under , with the figure estimated to be just . per cent for  to -year-olds and  per cent for  to -year-olds. The very high prevalence of the virus at the start of the year will have meant many people were unable to get an extra jab, as vaccines cannot be given to anybody who has tested positive within the previous  days. But despite infection levels falling in recent weeks, as yet there is no sign that take-up of boosters among young adults is starting to accelerate. Deaths The number of deaths in England where Covid- was recorded on the death certicate averaged between  and  a day during January , according to the ONS. This is far below the equivalent figures for January , when deaths per day averaged between  to ,. While deaths in recent weeks have been higher than much of the second half of last year, the impact of the vaccine rollout is clear.  There has not been the kind of surge in deaths during the Omicron wave that occurred in the first and second waves of Covid-, despite Omicron being a highly transmissible iant of the virus. Vaccine effectiveness against mortality with the Omicron iant for people aged  and over is estimated to be  per cent at two or more weeks after a booster jab, compared with around  per cent at -plus weeks after a second dose, according to the UK Health Security Agency. As of January  , , deaths had occurred in England where Covid- was mentioned on the death certicate, either as the main cause or a contributory factor, the ONS said. The highest number on a single day was , on January  . During the first wave of the virus, the daily toll peaked at , on April  . Around nine in  deaths with Covid- on the death certicate since the start of the pandemic have coronavirus as the primary cause of death, with a minority listing the virus as a contributory factor.

He said: We looked out of the window upstairs and saw the first two trees laying across the electricity cable. He said they were the two biggest in the garden, standing at around twice the height of the house.Five minutes later, another gust took down the other five trees.It was a little bit of a shock to see what was a wooded garden flattened, the retired banker said, adding that his eight-year-old daughter was particularly upset because she was attached to the garden and her swings hanging from the trees.  The fallen power lines sparked two small electrical fires, which took firefighters  hours to extinguish, in the familyaposs orchard. On Monday, energy minister Greg Hands visited the home to see the damage wrought by the storms. He said some , homes were still without power and that Storm Franklin had hampered recovery efforts. Energy crews in high-visibility jackets were working in Mr Thomasaposs garden to cut up the uprooted trees and hoist the wires back up to reconnect them to the network. They expected power to be restored by the evening. Mr Thomas said: We always knew that, once they arrived, it would take two days.  He said it was a little bit frustrating but understandable that the power company had prioritised getting the hundreds of houses in the village up and running before tackling their isolated problem. He was glad the trees had not fallen towards the house. The power going out was awful for everybody but itaposs better than the house being wrecked, he said.The family have stayed warm with a wood burner and cooked eggs and sausages in a pan over the fire.Mr Thomas said: A good friend lent us a generator so we could get light when it got dark on Friday night, then about cooking we got the BBQ out. You just get on with it really. The first night was quite exciting for the children it got a little bit less exciting the second day and the third day. Mr Thomas said the family grew so tired of the conditions that they stayed in a hotel on Sunday night.

It is the use of forceful violence which caused the catastrophic injuries found at post mortem. Williamson, Cole, and the teenage boy are all accused of murder and perverting the course of justice. Describing Logan as a “polite, kind and caring” youngster, Ms Rees accused each of the defendants of playing their own part in his killing.Ms Rees said: Logan was described by those who knew and loved him in during his short le as a lovely little boy, Chatty, polite, kind and caring. He was five years old when his body was found by police in the River Ogmore in Pandy Park, Bridgend. Logan was murdered and each of the defendants played their part in killing him. Logan would not have stood a chance against any one of these defendants, let alone three of them acting together.  Having killed Logan behind closed doors in the family home they each played their part in covering up the circumstances of his death. Each were desperate to save themselves and each prioritised their self-preservation over everything , in particular over the needs of Logan. He would not have stood a chance against any one of the defendants, let alone three of them acting together. Ms Rees said mum Williamson phoned  at .am to ly report Logan missing, and was crying down the phone and sounding asshe were hyperventilating. The court heard she told police she had left the back gate open and then set to blame another woman for kidnapping Logan. Ms Rees said: She appeared to be distressed and asshe were hyperventilating. This was an elaborate charade. The court heard Logan suffered severe injuries compared to a fall from a great height or a high velocity road traffic collision.  Ms Rees said: Logan had suffered severe injuries to his internal organs and brain. His brain suffered suffered trauma and he had  external injuries including to the head, face, to the trunk, arms and legs. Logan was reported missing from his flat in Lower Llansantffraid, Sarn, Bridgend, in the morning of July  last year before his body was found a short while later. Ms Rees said: Logan was disposed of by the defendants asfly-tipping. Judge Mrs Justice Jefford told jurors: Cases that relate to a personaposs death are as serious as you as a jury can be entrusted to deal with. The death of anyone, particularly the death of a child, may give rise to serious feelings or emotions. In any part it is important you put your emotions to one side and judge this case on careful and thoughtful consideration of the evidence. Williamson and Cole appeared in the dock at Cardf Crown Court while the youngster appeared via videolink from another room inside the court building. Williamson and the teenage boy deny murder and perverting the course of justice.Cole denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice. Cardf Crown Court heard the three are accused of moving Loganaposs body from his home to an area near the River Ogmore at Pandy Park in Sarn, Bridgend. The charge states they moved Loganaposs clothing to the same area and allegedly washed his blood-stained bedsheets and phoned police to ly report him as missing saying his location was unknown. Logan - also known as Logan Williamson - had been reported missing by his mother before his body was discovered just  metres from his home in the Ogmore River in Bridgend, South Wales, on July . A court previously heard the youngster suffered “extreme pain” in an attack before he was found following a search. Cole is represented by David Elias QC, Williamson by Peter Rouch QC and the youth by John Hipkin QC. The trial, expected to last up to eight weeks, continues.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderCourt caseCrown courtMurder trialCrime\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Their relationship was still secret, so most of their early dates took place in private restaurants or at each otheraposs homes where they knew they were safe from prying eyes. But as they grew stronger, they started venturing out into the outside world. While in Meghanaposs Canadian hometown, Toronto, the pair wanted to celebrate Halloween, so they came up with a plan.Meghan revealed that she and Harry, along with Princess Eugenie and her now-husband Jack Brooksbank went on a night out at Soho House in Toronto - but to make sure nobody recognised them, they went in disguise.

And the four of us snuck out in Halloween costumes to just have one fun night on the town before it was out in the world that we were a couple. Ellen said: So you went with Harry to a Halloween party and they had no idea it was the two of you  Meghan confirmed this, saying: It was a post-apocalypse theme, so we had all this very bizarre costuming on, and we were able to just have one fun final night out. But it was this night that Prince Harry received a call that would change their relationship forever.In an unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors said the pair were having the perfect night out - until they received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. The couple were told that the press had discovered they were dating. The next day, their relationship would be announced all over the world. So, the Halloween party was the last opportunity that Meghan and Harry would be able to celebrate their relationship privately.It appears Eugenie has remained close to Harry following his and Meghanaposs choice to stand down from the royal family, as they were seen together at the Super Bowl in the US last week. The royal pair were pictured together in the stands - although were without Meghan and Eugenieaposs husband Jack. According to royal expert and biographer Duncan Larcombe, Eugenie publicly supporting Harry at the Super Bowl shows she is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals. He told OK!: The royals have stayed quite consistent and firm when it comes to Harry and Meghan, as we’ve seen. Eugenie is breaking ranks from the rest of the royals by being seen so publicly to endorse Harry and Meghan in their new le. It endorses what they said about the royals. There are those that think that Eugenie is Harry’s only hope of him being brought back in should things not work out in paradise, so at least he is talking to someone in the Royal Family. By seeing Eugenie there, it looks like the only link he still has with his family.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

The charity shop volunteer from Speke, Liverpool finds herself ironing  dferent pieces of unorm each morning and making three dferent meals at dinner time for her brood of fussy eaters. Vicky, and her partner Craig Williams, , make sure to stock up on all of the essentials to cater for their blended family of  who go through  pints of milk and  loaves of bread per week. She is a proud mum to, Tom,  Ellie,  Libby,  Lexie,  Mikey,  Craig,  Riley, eight Annie, six twins Matilda and Teddy, four James,  weeks and Emma and Lottie who sadly passed.The stay at home mum, said: “It’s definitely a full-time job catering to such a large family, but it’s always been my dream to be a mum. “We have a five-bed house where seven of the kids live with us full time, and Craig’s two come and stay at the weekends. “Our days start pretty early, and the kitchen is one of the most hectic places to be.  “We only have two bathrooms as well, so trying to get all of the kids washed and dressed can be dficult, especially with the bathroom hogs! “Two of the older kids are in high school so they have hot lunches, the primary school kids have packed lunches which are super quick and easy to put together. “The twins are at nursery part time, so they come home for lunch, and we will usually have some quick like sandwiches.“Craig and I are in the kitchen from around .pm to pm for dinner each day as we usually have to cook three entirely dferent meals, as a few of the kids are pretty picky eaters. “We cook everything from chicken nuggets and chips to pasta bakes, spaghetti bolognese, and curries. “Sundays are quite relaxing when it comes to meal times though, as everyone loves a Sunday dinner, so I try and make a roast at least twice a week. She added: “Most of my day is spent in the kitchen, as when I get up, I have to iron the kids’ unorms, and put on the first of several loads of washing. “Most of the kids will wear their clothes for one day and then just put in the basket, so it’s something we are trying to cut down on, as it’s just non-stop cycles up until pm each night. “I try and get all of the cleaning done in the morning, but as soon as the twins come home, Teddy is like a tornado creating messes in my wake.  “Although Teddy does really enjoy cleaning sometimes and even has a little rag and spray bottle that he walks around the house with. “All of the kids are tasked with tidying their own bedrooms and will sometimes help out at meal times.” With such a big family, days out can be expensive, so Vicky and Craig make sure to be as budget as possible exploring parks and having picnics. She said: “The young one’s love going on walks and on days out. “Craig takes them all on muddy walks by the sea, and they just love getting messy and splashing around in puddles with their wellies. “We have lots of local parks around as well, so we also make sure to pack a big picnic on days out during the summer. “It’s always been my dream to have a big farmhouse where all of the wellies are lined up at the back door – so it’s great that we can get the kids enjoying nature in other ways for now.” After catering for their children  , Craig and Vicky very rarely get any personal time, so have had to be inventive with ways to get away every now and again. Vicky said: “I volunteer at a charity shop, and it’s so nice to just be me and be called Vicky, rather than being shouted at with ‘mum’ or ‘mummy’. “It’s nice to have a change of scenery every now and again. “Craig and I very rarely have a date night, but we will always go out together on our birthdays and anniversaries as a little treat.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON EducationPregnancySecondary schoolTwins\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The message was found by a member of the public late last month and could provide clues as to the whereabouts of the chef who was last seen  years ago.Photo evidence of the tribute shows a small bouquet of flowers placed next to a laminated missing personaposs photo of Claudia. On the bottom of the page, there is a chilling note written in block capitals that reads she is in the water, with two arrows pointing in one direction. There is also a separate note that says god bless her on one side of the page.  Family spokesperson Martin Dales said the tribute was originally found on January . It could be interpreted in all sorts of ways, he said. There are clearly many parts that make up the jigsaw, and after  years it is high time the truth becomes clear and the publicaposs vigilance in reporting information is vital. Information is going to find the answers here. Itaposs really down to people to keep coming forward with information. I donapost know what to think. Itaposs an unusual situation for a member of the public to come across something like this.  While the exact location hasnapost been revealed, itaposs understood the tribute wasnapost discovered at Sand Hutton gravel pits, near York, where investigations took place last September. During those investigations, specialist officers conducted a fingertip examination of the site, eight miles from Claudiaaposs home. On that occasion, around  cops were involved in combing the popular fishing site for clues, which included trimming back woodland near the two lakes. Specialist search teams also pumped water for around a week, with one lake at the site left almost empty. No one has heard from Claudia since she called her mother Joan on the evening of March , .She failed to arrive for work at York University the next day and was reported missing by her father, Peter. The disappearance remains unexplained and is now treated by North Yorkshire Police as suspected murder. Tragically, her father died earlier this year aged  without finding out what had happened to his daughter. Mr Lawrence spearheaded a nationwide search for his daughter Claudia, which cost police around £m over the last decade. Nine people have been questioned, but no charges have ever been brought. Martin paid tribute to Mr Lawrence, with whom he had enjoyed a -year friendship, following the update.  He said: He asked me to do this - to keep his daughter Claudiaaposs name in public lights and not forgotten by the authorities looking for her. On a personal level, I miss Peter hugely after nearly  years of friendship and over  years of seeking out with him what has happened to Claudia. However, a spokesman for North Yorkshire Police said: The person who left the item has been identied as a spiritualist and they have been spoken to by the investigation team. There are no substantive links to the inquiry.

In a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon, Boris Johnson confirmed free universal testing would end in England at the start of April.But to stop members of the public buying more kits than needed in the month leading up to April , the government has limited sales to a single LFT box every three days. Previously, people could buy one kit per day to check for Covid infection.It comes as Johnson updated MPs on the ending of all coronavirus restrictions.He says the UK must now scale back testing but that the UK will have the ability to ramp up testing in the NHS should the need arise.He added that science advisors are certain there will be future new iants.Boris Johnson told MPs: Until April  we will still advise people who test positive to stay at home but after that we will encourage people with Covid- symptoms to exercise personal responsibility, just as we encourage people who may have flu to be considerate to others.

It cost a further £. billion in this financial year and £ billion in January alone at the height of the Omicron wave.

Nicola Fawkes, from Ynyshir in Wales, said her children were left in tears by the absolutely disgusting accommodation at the Brean Sands resort. The family were shocked to find rubbish and dirt everywhere in their rooms, she added.The -year-old mum, her four children, parents and niece had originally planned to stay at the nearby Sandy Glade holiday park but when they arrived late on Friday they found it was closed because of Storm Eunice, Wales Online reports.The family spent £ on a seven-day holiday at Pontins as a replacement. They stayed at a hotel overnight and got to Brean Sands on Saturday afternoon. Pontins has its reputation, said Nicola. We had our cleaning essentials ready, expecting a bit of dust. With Covid, I naively thought theyaposd have stepped up their game but nothing could prepare us for what we walked into.Nicola and her family joined the check-in queue at pm. When we got to the queue there were already people complaining about issues with chalets not being clean, said Nicola. I thought, aposHere we go, itaposs starting.apos We got to where we were staying and I could see the windows were very dirty. I could see through the windows there was a wooden drawer on the sofa. I thought the cleaner must still be in there. On opening the door, there was a damp smell and it was a case of: aposWhere do you look first, what do you take a photo of first apos My daughters were going, aposOh my god mam, look at this, itaposs disgusting.aposThe fridge was in the middle of the kitchen unplugged. Where the fridge was supposed to be, there was dirt. There were burn marks on the splashback for the cooker. The wardrobe was in the middle of one bedroom. There was a big long screw on one of the beds. In the bathroom there was faeces down the toilet. There were dead spiders on the ceilings. There was rubbish absolutely everywhere, an ibuprofen packet, dust, a dirty kne on the kitchen floor. There was mould on the bottom of the curtains and the ceiling. It was just horrendous. It makes you feel physically sick that they expect people to stay there on holiday. Nicola went back to reception. She said there was a queue of  to  other people who also had complaints, from dead spiders in the bath to broken wardrobes.I told the manager I wouldnapost expect a dog to sleep in that place, she added. They said thereaposd been a backlog because of the storm. I said the storm was outside rather than inside our chalet. Although it looked like it had been inside. Nicola said the manager told her the accommodation had been missed on the cleaning list. She was offered a dferent chalet — but it did not impress the family much more. So we walked into the next one and I would say, out of , it was . better. The first one had not really been on the scale, it was way down in the minuses. This one had patio door windows you couldnapost see through because of the grime.Again the furniture was all in the middle of rooms. The fridge was again unplugged in the middle of the kitchen. There was urine down the toilet. There was a dead spider in the corner of the bathroom, cobwebs everywhere, black dirt all up the curtains. There were white splashes on the front of the fridge, I donapost knowit was milk. On one bed there was a see-through bag with pillows in. I was in shock. By this point my two younger ones were crying. Weaposd been travelling for hours. We went back up to reception and it was even more packed than the first time with people complaining. I got to the front of the queue and said, aposYouaposve got to be having a giraffe. This is my second property and itaposs disgusting.apos Again, they said itaposs been missed from the cleaning list. I said, aposAll the people here, have their properties been missed too aposThe manager said yes. He said, aposIf youaposre not happy you can leave.apos He was quite abrupt at this point. I said, aposOK I want my refund now.apos I was told I would have to wait until Monday for the woman who deals with refunds to be in the office. Nicola said the manager told her cleaners would go to the chalet urgently so she ed. But three hours passed and no one came, she claimed. So I drove back to reception, she added. Itaposs about .pm now. Once he got past the other people with complaints, the manager came to us. He was hostile, he recognised me straight away. I said it had been three hours and he said, aposTheyaposre on their way.apos  I said, aposEvery one of us is going to get out of the car and stand in reception, including my children, and weaposre going to do a standoff.apos He radioed through and then he told me the cleaners had been to the property. We went back to check and as we got there, two lads in their mid-s were leaving. There was still a dead spider but it looked good on the surface. They were very apologetic, I canapost fault those two boys. Then our electricity went off. My dad went to reception and it was  minutes before it came back on. We were there in the pitch black using torches on our phones. There was no bedding. We had to wait about an hour for duvets to arrive. Itaposs about .pm at this point and my younger children usually go to bed at .pm. The two lads whoaposd cleaned the property arrived with the duvets, and then they came back another  to  minutes later with the pillows.  When Nicola woke the next morning she felt like she had been dragged through a hedge backwards. She described the bed as like cardboard. She said: If it wasnapost for my children being upset because they thought they werenapost going to get a holiday, thereaposs no way I would have stayed in that property. Itaposs not fit for a dog. The holiday feeling has gone. If Sandy Glade reopens tonight, then weaposre gone.

In , famed American photographer Annie Leibovitz was given the great honour of photographing Her Majesty at Buckingham Palace. The dramatic shots show the Queen posing in the palaceaposs White Drawing Room and looking resplendent in ious combinations of jewels, orders, robes and furs. However, during the shoot, Annie made an unexpected request while the monarch was dressed in an opulent gown and dazzling tiara. She asked the Queenshe would take off her tiara and said: I think it will look better without the crown.  Iaposve heard that you do your own hair and make-up, which is so amazing, could we try without the crown  It will look better, less dressy. And with her famous quick wit, the Queen issued a sassy response, by gesturing to her opulent robe and saying: Less dressy  What do you think this is  However, the Queen duly obliged and Annie captured some wonderful shots of Her Majesty. And she must have impressed as Annie was invited back to the UK several years later to snap portraits for the monarchaposs th birthday.

She even later remarked in an interview how she was impressed with how feisty the Queen was. Annie said: What was remarkable about the shoot was her resolve, her devotion to duty, she stayed until I said it was over.Meanwhile, last week, the Queen showed off an adorable never-before-seen photo showing her surrounded by some of her great-grandchildren.  The snap could be spotted in pictures released showing her holding an in-person audience with military officials in the Oak Room, her private sitting room, at Windsor Castle.Itaposs unclear where exactly the photo was taken - but it appears to have been at her Scottish Highlands retreat of Balmoral. In it, the Queen can be seen sitting on a sofa surrounded by nine of her younger relatives.  Standing behind the sofa and posing for the camera appears to be her granddaughter, Lady Louise Windsor, beside her great-grandchildren Prince George, Isla Phillips, Princess Charlotte and Savannah Phillips. Meanwhile, sitting beside her on the sofa appear to be Prince Louis, Mia Tindall and Lena Tindall.

But the way the Queen likes it cooked is quite surprising, according to a former member of staff.Grant Harrold, who worked with the royal family for seven years as a butler to Prince Charles at Highgrove House, told MyLondon that Her Majesty likes her steak well-done and that it is apparently quite unusual for her to have it cooked like that.Grant said: The Queen likes beef well done, she has things well done, which is really interesting. I find in the world of aristocracy, things are always kind of medium or rare but she likes it well done.

Most people like it rare or still kind of walking. He went on to say the Royal Family all have a very healthy diet that is very traditional, just home-cooked food.Prince William and Prince Harry were brought up on the same sort of diet, he said, adding how much they loved cottage pie.The boys were the same, they were brought up on traditional things - so the things we all love, he said. It was revealed the Queen takes her steak well done when former royal chef Darren McGrady recreated one of her favourite meals, Gaelic steaks, on his YouTube channel.During the video, he said: It was really, really important that we got a really good sear on the steaks and cooked her steak well done. He served the steak with a thick mushroom sauce, which is made with lashes of cream because one thing the Queen doesnapost care about is calories, he says. “The Queen was never one for surprises in the kitchen, McGrady said, as he said some of the dishes on her regular menu date back to Queen Victoria’s era, including the kitchen’s classic chocolate cake. The Chocolate Biscuit Cake is the only cake that goes back again and again and again every day until itaposs all gone, he told baking website RecipePlus.

Logan Mwangi was found dead after being dumped in the River Ogmore near his home village of Sarn in Bridgend County on July  . He was wearing mismatched pyjamas and had  catastrophic injuries to his head, face, torso, arms and legs, a jury of seven woman and five men were told on Monday. Prosecutor Caroline Rees QC said the little boyaposs injuries were from blunt force trauma, with experts saying they were more consistent with a fall from great height or high speed car crash. Loganaposs mother Angharad Williamson, , step-dad John Cole, , and a teenage boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are charged with murdering the youngster between July  and August .All three are also accused of perverting the course of justice, including moving Loganaposs body to the river near Pandy Park, removing his clothing, washing bloodstained bed linen, and making a  missing person report to police. Williamson and the youth pleaded not guilty to both offences, while Cole denied murder. Williamson and Cole were also charged with causing or allowing the death of a child, which they both denied. Ms Rees said it is the prosecutionaposs case that Logan had been submitted to a brutal and sustained assault by John Cole and the teenage boy on July  while he was hidden from view, behind closed doors in Loganaposs home in Lower Llansantffraid. She told the court: The prosecutionaposs case is that Logan was murdered and each of these three defendants played their part... Ms Rees said Williamson had done nothing to prevent or report the attack on her young son, not even disclosing what had happened when a social worker visited the house on the same day.  The teenager, who had previously made repeated threats that he wanted to kill Logan and wanted him dead was described by Ms Rees as a complex, troubled and violent boy who had been trained in the martial art of Muay Thai, also known as Thai boxing, to green belt level, the court heard. The jury were shown CCTV footage of Cole and the teenager leaving Loganaposs home in the early hours of July . Cole was filmed carrying something in his arms, which he later admitted was Loganaposs leless body. The pair walked across the river and along a path to the spot where Loganaposs body was found, the court was told. Cole and the boy then ed to the property before heading out again, this time to dispose of Loganaposs bloodied and torn dinosaur pyjama top, the court heard.  During this time, a light can be seen switching on and off in Loganaposs bedroom, which the prosecution said proves Williamson was awake and knew what had happened to her son. Ms Rees told the court that evidence from Williamsonaposs mobile phone, which showed she was awake in the early hours of the morning - after the time she told police she had gone to sleep - also proves her involvement. Williamson is said to have struggled to raise Logan in the lead up to his death, with her motherly bond with her son signicantly fractured during his time in self-isolation, Ms Rees said. She added: Angharad Williamson must have been awake and up and about, fully aware Logan had died and that his body had been dumped in the river - disposed of like they were fly-tipping rubbish.  An apparently distraught Williamson reported Logan missing at .am on July , accusing a woman she did not like of kidnapping him, the court was told.Cole and the youth were then caught on CCTV again, this time walking around and calling for Logan, jurors heard.Williamsonaposs  call and the alleged faked search for Logan were described by Ms Rees as a callous and elaborate attempt to cover up the trioaposs role in his death.Williamson, dressed in a navy blue blazer and glasses with dark brown hair, appeared distressed as a summary of the evidence against her and the two other defendants was read out. She began to cry, becoming more upset as the jury was shown a picture of Logan and the circumstances of his death were described. She sobbed as she was led out of the dock at the end of the hearing. Cole appeared in the dock wearing glasses and a light grey V-neck jumper over a white T-shirt, while the teenager appeared in a black T-shirt via video link from another room in the court. Both adults have been remanded in custody since they were charged.

Many of those services which weren’t preemptively cancelled have been by blocked or flooded tracks and roads.As well as the yellow weather warning which remains across the UK until midday today, more than  flood warnings and alerts were issued.This included two severe flood warnings where there was a risk to le on the River Mersey in East Didsbury and at West Didsbury and Northenden. Rain was so bad overnight, that some parts of Manchester began evacuating people, with over  homes at risk as the River Mersey burst its banks. Have you been hammered by Storm Franklin  Email webnews@mirror  Shortly after am this morning, Councillor Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council said the “process of evacuation was already underway.“We’re working closely with the police, fire service and the Environment Agency to protect residents living in the areas where we have severe flood warnings.The process of evacuation is already under way in order to protect as many people as possible given the forecast of more heavy rain throughout the day.”  Manchester and Derbyshire were some of the areas worst affected by the flooding as local rivers burst their banks and streets were flooded. Matlock, Derbyshire, was described as having had its streets in the town centre turned into a river. Such was the chaos caused on our roads and rail lines that train providers took the drastic action over advising Brits against using them, with some going as far as telling Brits to simply not travel today.  CrossCounty Trains said: “We are strongly recommending not to travel today. “Storms over the past week will have tested the infrastructure and with Storm Franklin today, we will have severe disruption across our network.” Meanwhile, National Rail asked customers to “avoid travelpossible” on Monday and South Western Railway issued a do not travel message after “a series of further incidents caused by high winds on Sunday evening”.  National Rail said the first services on most routes were cancelled, while there is a reduced timetable for Monday, alternative travel is unavailable and further disruption is expected. Major flooding across parts of Yorkshire has blocked multiple lines and shuttered South Yorkshireaposs Rotherham Central railway station until Tuesday. Rail operator TransPennine Express told customers on Twitter : Due to a river flooding the railway at Mexborough, trains are currently unable to operate between Doncaster, Meadowhall and Sheffield. All lines are blocked. In the capital, where wind gusts are up to around mph, London Overground services are cancelled or reduced. Roads across the country have been shut thanks to the high winds and torrential rain, whether because of debris like trees knocked over, or flooding carriageways.An Amber Warning for wind on Northern Ireland expired at am this morning and winds will peak during rush hour according to to Greg Dewhurst, senior meteorologist at the Met Office. He added that conditions will noticeably ease around lunchtime. The heavy showers that lashed northern England and Northern Ireland are set to move south-east he added and around midday, the Met Office removed a number of flood warnings. Storm Franklinaposs highest gust of mph was recorded at the Needles on the Isle of Wight on Sunday evening, followed by current gusts of mph on a mountaintop in Wales.  Itaposs still pretty strong out there and it will continue to be strong over the next few hours, Mr Dewhurst told the PA news agency. Thousands of homes in the UK are still without power due to Storm Eunice, and Storm Franklin is complicating recovery efforts. This came after huge waves were seen crashing on to coastal areas, homes were destroyed by strong winds, and emergency services deployed flood defences along swelling riverbanks on Sunday.  Colossal waves have been captured engulfing Newhaven lighthouse in West Quay, East Sussex, and Porthcawl Lighthouse in Bridgend, Wales. The River Don burst its banks in the Sprotbrough area of Doncaster in South Yorkshire on Sunday night, and police have warned people to stay away from dangerous fast-flowing water. South Yorkshire Police said: We ask people to remain away from the area of Sprotbrough Falls and Sprotbrough Lock in Doncaster, after the River Don burst its banks in this location earlier this evening. Many of the footpaths in this area are presently under water. The water is fast-flowing and poses a risk to people attempting to wade through it. Members of the public are being asked to remain away from the area at this time for their own safety. Thank you. Central Sheffieldaposs flood defences appear to have held, despite fears as the River Don raged through the city on Sunday night. Last week marked the first time three named storms have been recorded within seven days since the storm-naming system began in , with Dudley, Eunice and Franklin.

The -year-old daughter of Brandy Roberson from Corpus Christi, Texas, was sat in the coffee shop studying when a man she didnapost know began talking to her.A barista clocked the interaction and, unsurethe young woman felt threatened, brought over a free drink with a secret note telling her how she could silently signal for help. In marker, the cup read: Are you okay  Do you want us to intervene  If you do, take the lid off the cup.Brandy told WKYC that her daughter didnapost believe she was in any danger from the man.She was sitting at her table alone studying and this man came by and noticed what she was studying and wanted to talk to her about it, the mum continued. He, I think, just kind of became really loud and animated about it.  Brandy said that her daughter felt comfortable in the situation so did not take off the lid, but was thankful for the baristaaposs intervention none-the-less. The teenager later ed home and told her mother what had happened.She was holding the cup and knew that I would love that someone did that for her, Roberson told Today.It made me feel so grateful that the Starbucks employees were watching out for her. As a mom, that is my worst fear that something would happen to my child and nobody would be there to help. She also shared a photo of the cup with the story on Facebook, writing that she was very grateful for people who look out for other people!The post has since gone viral, racking up more than , likes. Messages written on the side of cups are an integral part of the Starbucks experience - as everyone with a hard to spell name will know. In  a Starbucks customer was completely shocked when he picked up his takeaway coffee and saw the name the staff had written on his cup. As is traditional in the coffee giantaposs stores, university student Sam gave his name to the person behind the till when ordering his iced drink.  The -year-old suffers from a stutter, and says the barista serving him mocked his speech when he was placing his order. He claims he said: Okay, S-s-s-sam. But things got even worse when Sam picked up his drink and saw what was written on the plastic cup itself. His name was actually written as SSSAM.Speaking to the The Philadelphia Inquirer, he said: Itaposs rare, as an adult, that that kind of disrespect happens.It happens, but itaposs really rare to see it in print. It felt rude.At the time a spokesperson for Starbucks told Fox News : Admittedly, we didnapost do a good job of understanding the situation. It was not an appropriate response.Weaposre trying to figure out what took place and once we do, weaposll take the appropriate actions and make a decision on how to handle it in the coming days.

The aircraft was travelling between Cincinnati and Phoenix when the bizarre event occurred shortly before twenty past one local time, reports the Daily Star.It quickly became one of the most signicant UFO sightings of last year, becoming one of several triggers that saw experts push for more transparency from the US government about investigations into alien le. The unexplained incident saw the pilot contact Albuquerque air traffic control to request information when he was heard askingthey had targets up in the air.  In an audio clip of the radio transmission, he added: We just had something just go over the top of us. I hate to say this but it looked like a long cylindrical object that almost looked like a cruise missile type of thing moving really fast right over the top of us. American Airlines initially played down the report.  However, a company spokesperson confirmed the incident in a statement that said: Following a debrief with our flight crew and additional information received we can confirm this radio transmission was from American Airlines Flight  on February .” The Federal Aviation Administration added in their statement that air traffic controllers did not see any object in the area on their radarscopes. But the sighting quickly became of the most signicant UFO sightings of  as it was one of several triggers that saw experts push for more transparency from the US government about investigations into alien le.In a Daily Star exclusive in September last year, anonymous pilots had come forward claiming that they could lose their jobs for reporting sightings - despite many being seen before.  One pilot said airline bosses are so hostile to ET claims that a colleague was told to get counselling after ­reporting a UFO. Another told the Daily Star Sunday : When someone says UFO everyone thinks they are referring to aliens but that is not always the case, especially with the surge in drone activity. Most pilots will use phrases like unidentied traffic or aerial phenomena. No one wants to say UFO. If you say UFO people think you are either drunk, on drugs or nuts.  Another pilot added: Many airline pilots, self-included, and military pilots have had encounters at altitude with UFOs over many decades and before the internet. Encounters are reported internally and amongst colleagues and seldom reach the media. When you are fortunate to be a close witness, it is really quite serious stuff.

Amongst these is Beinn Odhar # its southern slopes lying firmly in the county of Stirling, whilst its summit stands proudly in Argyll.If approached from the west, north or south you could keep your toes in Argyll all day. Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path. If you use the latter, ensure you head upwards at around NN. Either way you will tend to end up on sections of the old mining path as it zigs zags upwards by default due to the natural line of the slope.Once you reach m # after approximately .km depending on how direct your route was # the ground becomes stonier. The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left. Ahead, the final ascent is best tackled by heading northeast then northwest to follow the hill’s natural line. There are no particular dficulties.The summit views are fabulous and an excellent panorama of Beinn Dorain can be had from the steep northern slopes above Coire Luaidh.It is easiest todown the southwestern slopes you ascended, but other possibilities could include some of the neighbouring Corbetts, especially the longer days in summer.Safety in the outdoorsThe described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.Whilst every effort is made to ensure the route is accurate at the time of going to print,  please be aware track and path closures can happen at any time.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience. [We are] working with CMAL on small vessel replacement.#[We are] looking to have a common style of vessel, -m long, to provide resilience across the west coast network and reduce upfront costs with a single model.

The NEU will of course enter the negotiations with GDST which we have been asking for.

opponents stood firm to claim three precious league points.A healthy crowd of almost  turned out in dreadful conditions, with gusts topping  miles per hour and intermittent sheets of freezing rain greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

Its appeal will be just as great to the hardcore numismatist as it will to the ‘investor collector’. “I can easily imagine a collector who has spent several hundreds of thousands of pounds on an original  Una and the Lion quite happily spending the same to have this piece sit next to the original in their collection.”The trial pieces are not official UK coins and are ‘one of one’ items – meaning they are not included in the mintage figures.To register for the auction, visit The Royal Mint website here."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas-film-home-alone-show-cinemas-next-month---watch","story":"Directed by Harry Potter director Christopher Columbus and released in , the film starring Macauley Culkin is one of the highest grossing live action comedies of all time. Its a Christmas classic that can this year once again be enjoyed on the big screen. Dates and times depend on the inidual cinema, with some showing the film for one weekend only, while others will have viewings throughout December. Heres everything you need to know...Home Alone will show in Vue cinemas around the country in December. Viewing dates depend on the inidual cinema. Home Alone on the big screen  Yep, that’s your present sorted.

Meanwhile, the Scottish Institute for Sport came aboard with funding and coaching help.Defeat at the European Championships in Finland ensured that the team arrived in Salt Lake City as underdogs. All eyes instead were on the men’s squad, who were favourites for a medal. “We were quite happy to fly under the radar,” says Martin.The curling was held in the city of Ogden, some distance from the main events. A small band of supporters, including MacDonald’s father, was there to cheer the women on. “He was the madman with the kilt and the British and Scottish flag,” she says.In the round-robin, Team GB lost to Canada, described by Donnelly as curling’s equivalent to Brazil in football and the All Blacks in rugby. Other defeats followed and it looked like the Scots were on their home early.As it turned out, they had one last chance to get back into the tournament and seized it. Victory in the semi-final against Canada saw Martin and her team lining up against Switzerland in the final.At this point, the UK and world media had caught up with the story. BBC decided to carry the final live on BBC before switching to BBC. Almost six million viewers watched a tense match where it fell to Martin to throw the last stone for victory. “The stone for glory,” whispered Donnelly.The rest was tears, cheers, and a mass welcome home at Glasgow Airport. The team were awarded MBEs, and Martin appeared on Ally McCoist’s team on Question of Sport.“It went a bit crazy,” says MacDonald, “but it was good”.They were hugely popular, says Donnelly. “I think people recognised in the nicest possible way they were just ordinary but extraordinary women.”Debbie Knox’s twin daughters were only young at the time, but now  they call her their “shero”.: Queen sends her congratulationsFor Martin, now a coach and mentor to players, it had been a try, try, and try again experience.“I lost so many Scottish finals, so many bronze medal matches over the years. ButI hadn’t done that I probably would not have won at the Olympics because you learn from these losses. It doesn’t matter what you want to do.

At the same time, it worth remembering that a dferent Scotland is possible and indeed in  was within reach.What was needed was for the losing side to accept the outcome of the referendum as a Once In A Generation event and for the Scottish Government to set out on a path of governance based on achieving a Scotland at ease with that outcome and itself. It would not have been easy and would have required real leadership from the First Minister and the co-operation of other parties, but as a national mission that work would have been well worth it. A good start might have been the sort of cross-party Team Scotland arrangements that Alex Salmond proposed in the event of a Yes vote. In addition the SNP leadership could have proposed that their party suspend Clause a of its constitutionand declared its commitment to Clause b . Who could disagree that national unity and harmony based on the outcome of a free and fair referendum is ultimately in the greater Scottish interest Instead, Nicola Sturgeon deliberately turned her face against the outcome of her governments referendum and chose the path of ever deeper and ever more bitter ision and stre. Far from seeking national unity, she could not even be bothered to attend a church service organised to promote reconciliation. One only needs to see the the denigration of commentators such as Sarah Smith and the partisan dismissal of the best available evidenceto witness the results of that decision.The Scotland that we have today was created by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP. We can only dream of what could be achievedthey worked as hard at creating unity as they have at creating ision. They should never be forgiven for what they have inflicted on us.Peter A Russell, Glasgow.ABUSING THE FIRST MINISTERBEING of a certain age, I am fortunate not to be privy to the goings-on in social media s except through the likes of The Herald and ious other traditional news outlets. Personally, in the unlikely event that I was involved in the same way, I would treat any inappropriate responses with contempt. Sarah Smith strikes me as being well able to take care of herself in this respect and I suspect that her impending departure to the United States is purely a good career move.I presume that Jill Stephensonis including herself as one of your better-educated readers and, as such, she should be aware that the meaning of words is all about context. Having examined Ms Smiths comments regarding Nicola Sturgeon \"enjoying\" the extra powers in relation to the pandemic and studied my Collins dictionary, I can only describe her use of the description was at best an unfortunate choice of word. Also, there is a lack of subtlety in her description of her detractors and she would have been more honest to openly criticise some parts of the supporters of independence.No decent person can excuse the vitriol reported regularly in media sources but Ms Stephenson is deluding herselfshe thinks such remarks are one-sided. While not being involved in these exchanges, I have overheard Ms Sturgeon being subjected to misogynistic and sometimes venomous comment from older men of my acquaintance who should know better.Gordon Evans, Glasgow.BBC ALWAYS PUTS ENGLAND FIRSTTHE point missing in the stooshie over Sarah Smith is that Scotland isn’t represented by the British Broadcasting Corporation. It doesn’t really matter who the Scotland political editor is because the organisation always has to put England first.Former BBC Scotland correspondent Kenneth MacDonald said the BBC dropped the ball with its  referendum coverage and this was because of colleagues from England. The BBC admitted it alienated independence supporters but still has not explained what it’s doing to win back their trust.When you listen to the BBC news, it’s about England, not Scotland. That’s because  per cent of the population lives down south. Power and network commissioning is all centred in England. And it’s well known that the BBC doesn’t spend as much in Scotland as it takes in licence fees. As in the Union, Scotland will never be an equal citizen in the BBC orbit. You loseyou are born in a Celtic nation.The BBC has helped separate Scotland from rUK, as has Brexit and nearly  years of enduring a Westminster Government Scots did not elect.Once Scotland regains its independence, it needs to establish a Scottish Public Broadcasting Corporation to reflect the ersity of opinion, culture and dynamism within Scotland.I’m certain most Scots wish Sarah Smith well in her new position covering the US. I just hope she develops a thicker skin, because over there, she’ll need it.Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.COULD SCOTLAND EMULATE TEAM GB IT was an uplting experience towards the end of the Winter Olympics in Beijing to be proud to be Scottish and British, as many are, with the men’s curling team, led by Bruce Mouat, winning silver and the women’s team, led by Eve Muirhead, winning gold . One was made proud not only by the sporting prowess of the two curling teams, but also by their demeanour.Team GB received £ million from lottery money and part of that was allocated to curling, which no doubt helped the curlers to reach the high standard of play required to be successful at the top levels. While the expenditure on curling was more than justied by the results, that on some other sports was much less so. In Your Guide To An Independent Scotland Scotland’s Future, published in advance of the  Referendum, the SNP stated: \"On independence the National Lottery will continue to operate in Scotland. People will still be able to play National Lottery games, and the infrastructure enabling them to do so will remain in place\" and further: \"We will ensure that Scotland continues to receive our fair share of funding from the National Lottery.\"Is the SNP, in advance of the admittedly-unlikely event of there being a second independence referendum any time soon, likely to provide assurance, come independence, that adequate funding will be available not only to encourage young people to take up sport and to improve their talents, but also to develop the skills of those with the talent to perform in the top ranks internationally as recently displayed by the Team GB curling teams Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.* AS we enthusiastically congratulate Scotland’s curlers for amazingly delivering gold and silver medals at the Beijing Winter Olympics, which represented GB’s total of two medals, we should also congratulate overall winners Norway.With a similar population to Scotland, the Norwegians miraculously amassed a total of  medals with  gold medals, being four more than Germany, seven more than China, and eight more than the United States. Regrettably and perhaps unsurprisingly given the poor performance of GB overall, the BBC and most of the UK mainstream media provided few,any, updates on the medal table, in stark contrast to coverage of the Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Rio and London. More importantly, Norway’s hugely better performance raises questions about the financial support for UK sports, and in particular whether the limited and selectively targeted support provided through Lottery funds is sufficient, not only to help win medals across a greater number of sports but to signicantly boost participation levels across all sports, especially those sports where at present there may be few prospects of winning medals.As we all wish for our planet to be made more habitable and we strive as iniduals to become fitter and healthier, is it not time for the UK Government to commit more of its resources to maximising the wellbeing of all of its citizens rather than to maximising the profits of wealthy friends and party donors Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.IN POWER TO STAY THERE have been a number of letters saying that, objective achieved, the SNP will dissipate like snow aff a dyke. I cant think of any countries in the last  years where, on gaining independence, the winner did not remain in power, often for many years.Alistair Tuach, Dumbarton.Read more: Shame on the SNP for its ignorant stance on nuclear power"},{"url":null,"title":"murray-redpath-insists-scotland-can-show-potential-under-20-side-look-bounce-back-france","story":"The age-grade side are also looking to bounce back from a disappointing result in Wales last time out, and the younger Redpath says he is confident the team can give a good account of themselvesthey manage to cut down their error count.“Compared to last year, we’ve given England a tough time for  minutes in this year’s Six Nations, and Wales scored twice in the last ten minutes due to little things on our part, so that’s where we need to improve,” says the -year-old, who is one of over a dozen players in the squad who were involved in Scotland’s  under-s Six Nations whitewash. “We know we can win these games, and we should really win these games – but because of our own little errors and inaccuracies, we’re shooting ourselves in the foot.

More than  private schools have given notice to leave the scheme since .The GDST trustees said they knew teachers would “want time to consider the new proposal and we are ready to talk these through in detail”.They said they were committed to reaching a settlement, and had invited the NEU to meet with them, but had also “requested that they call off this week’s proposed industrial action while these discussions take place”.“With the Trustees’ decision announced today, the pursuit of strike action with a new proposal on the table would cause unnecessary disruption for students,” they said.They added that they “care deeply about our teachers” and would not have put proposals forward unless they felt they were “absolutely necessary” for the long-term future of the trust.They said the sustainability of the trust’s future would enable them to “continue to provide an excellent and affordable independent education for our students” and at the same time offer teachers a “comfortable retirement”.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “It is very disappointing that the GDST has not reversed their decision to withdraw from the Teachers Pension Scheme .”“If they were really listening to the strength of feeling from their staff, they would realise that short term financial sweeteners offer no compensation for the long-term security of the TPS.”“There is no financial imperative for GDST to insist on removing staff from the TPS next year. The NEU will of course enter the negotiations with GDST which we have been asking for. However, this offer gives our members no reassurance that the TPS will remain in place and the strike action will go ahead on this week.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1564499438658.jpg--agri_food_leaders_call_on_stormont_to_follow_the_science_on_climate_change_legislation.jpg?1564499438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220221newsagri food leaders call on stormont to follow the science on climate change legislation","story":"Industry leaders within the agri-food supply chain have said thatpassed unchanged, the Executive Climate Change Bill would have devastating consequences, including job losses, for the Northern Ireland economy. The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us.

We#lla combination of general practice, community pharmacy and trusts. What we#re doing is working out the best for iniduals concerned and to get the best uptake,” she said.Ms Donnelly’s comments come as Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced all Covid restrictions will end in England on Thursday and the mass testing programme will cease on April .He said free testing will be targeted at the most vulnerable, as Mr Johnson outlined the government’s Living With Covid plan for England.The plan also confirmed that those who test positive for coronavirus will no longer be legally required to isolate from Thursday.While Northern Ireland does not have to take the same approach, the mass testing programme has been funded throughout the pandemic by Westminster, leaving the region having to fund its own test and trace system.On Monday the Department of Health said it will “carefully consider” the plans for England and its implications for Northern Ireland, but reiterated that “no decisions have been taken on any changes to test and trace” here.Dr David Farren from the British Medical Association Northern Ireland said moves to remove free testing and the need to legally isolate “risks the most vulnerable”.“Testing people and isolating them is the way you stop the bug jumping from one person to another and effectively the Prime Minister has removed two very important protections in England with that move,” he told BBC’s Good Morning Ulster.“You are now no longer going to know who has Covid and evenyou do have symptoms that might be in keeping with that, nobody has to isolate away.“That risks the most vulnerable in our population.

Everything we did we did together.”Despite being a dedicated politician and DUP member from an early age, his friend said that he was able to unite people of all political beliefs and none.“We never talked about politics, obviously I would have asked about his career and what he wanted to do, but politics never came up,” he said.The -year-old Deputy Speaker of the assembly was married to Laura with whom he had four children.“His wit was unbelievable as was his intelligence, I was in awe of how much information he could retain.“But it was his kids and Laura that were his le.“I remember when he and Laura started dating in school and it was just an instant attraction. We all knew after about six months of them dating that was it, that was who Chris was going to end up with.“In the last few days people have said what a devoted family man he was, but Laura was equally devoted to him.“They were a team, she was his support, she was his rock. Whatever he wanted to do with his career she backed him. They were teenage sweethearts, they were destined to spend their entire le together. they were a team both at home and professionally, she was his biggest supporter.”Mr Caughey-Rogers said the death of his closest friend “still hasn’t set in”.“I have spoke to a few of our old friends, to be honest we are still not at the point of being able to deal with the fact that he’s not going to be here.“The type of person Chris was, he could bring anyone together and you could see that in the unity in the response to his passing. “It’ll be strange going back home and not arranging to go out for a drink with him. Any time I knew I was coming home I would have messaged and arrange to meet up, I can’t imagine coming home and not seeing my friend. He is such a loss, to his friends, his family and his community”.Read MoreMark Bain:OpinionPolitically ided, but Stormont parties unite in grief and respect for Christopher StalfordRelated topicsChristopher StalfordKeir StarmerNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Christopher StalfordAnti-Protocol rally postponed as ‘mark of respect’ following death of DUP’s Christopher Stalford PremiumPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordWarm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher Stalford PremiumViewpointOpinionDeath of Stalford puts our squabbles into real perspectiveMost ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...The dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadChristopher Stalford’s death: A bright light has gone out in our party and in NI politics, says Sir JeffreyOur everlasting love affair with the song Kenneth Branagh wanted as ‘a message of hope’Top VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest Northern IrelandAnti-Protocol rally postponed as ‘mark of respect’ following death of DUP’s Christopher StalfordTeam effort comes first for Linfield#s milestone man Jamie MulgrewSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of borderI’m up for the challenge, says Radio Ulster’s new drivetime news regularMichael DonnellyOpinionMurdered man went to niece’s house to scare her off drugs, court toldLatestBBC responds to complaints over interview with Novak DjokovicAirlines continue operating flights between UK and UkraineKeith Gillespie hopes Liam Boyce and Michael Smith reverse ‘disappointing’ unavailability for Northern IrelandWhat are the latest developments in the Ukraine crisis Top civil servants should not show support for Black Lives Matter – Rees-Mogg,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Party politics was set aside. Only one item was on the agenda. The House paid its respects and heard the fine words of tribute to Christopher Stalford.One by one his colleagues and rivals stood to deliver the words they did not wish to say. And it was, in a strange way, lovely to hear them say these words and know they meant every one of them.Gone were the tones of bitterness. Gone, too, the cutting cross-party interjections, those with which Christopher Stalford was so prolic during his time in the Assembly.Speaker Alex Maskey opened the Assembly and told of how their backgrounds came from dferent perspectives of le here, but how they had formed a very positive working relationship.But it will be among the ranks of the DUP that Christopher Stalford will be most missed by those who knew him best.As Mr Maskey gave way to DUP deputy leader, Paula Bradley, she stood, wearing black and clutching a handkerchief. You could tell tears were not far away as she began by saying she wished to “honour and give thanks for the le of our much-loved friend and esteemed colleague”.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respects FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueAn emotional DUP deputy leader Paula Bradley pays her respectsShe added: “Words cannot adequately explain the sense of pain and loss that is felt on these benches. Christopher’s joy came not in holding office but in how he could use that office to improve the everyday lives of those he was honoured to represent. It was a mark of the man that he had friends on all sides of this chamber.”Very quickly that became apparent. Across the chamber, Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey led the tributes from Sinn Fein due to the absence of Michelle O’Neill, who’s self-isolating at home due to Covid.She said: “Sadness has fallen upon this chamber. No words can describe the shock, anguish and pain his family is feeling.“I first met Mr Stalford at Belfast City Council and instantly thought he was older than me due to his mannerisms and the attire of his pinstriped suit, initially thinking this was the instructed unorm of all DUP councillors at that time.“He enjoyed the cut and thrust of debate in committees and the debating chamber. While our politics dfered, we shared similarities, growing up in working-class communities in south Belfast.”Mrs O’Neill later tweeted: “I’m struck by the shared sense of loss across the political spectrum. I am reminded that there is far more that unites us than ides us. Rest in peace Christopher.”For almost two-and-half hours, tributes came from all corners of the house, and MLAs also stood respectfully in a minute’s silence.From the SDLP, Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said: “This is a very sombre day for our Assembly, but particularly for Christopher Stalford’s friends and colleagues in the DUP.“I got to know a man who was challenging, argumentative, ambitious, some may even say combative, during debates, but also a man who was kind, quick-witted, fiercely intelligent and very funny. Christopher Stalford was unique.”Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie echoed what many in the Assembly had felt when they heard the tragic news.“My heart sank,” he said.“I have no quick quip to truly outline the person that we all knew, that we all had interactions with. Christopher was unique, absolutely unique. He was a fierce debater. I didn’t just like Christopher Stalford, I was jealous of Christopher Stalford.”There was none of the usual passion from TUV leader Jim Allister, a man rarely lost for words. In fact, they struggled to come today.The tributes continued throughout the session, but perhaps most enlightening was the insight into the person behind the political mask worn in public.The anecdotes from committee rooms and back corridors of power, even the tales of casual conversations between rivals MLAs. Not agreeing about something doesn’t always mean the respect, even the friendship, of those from rival parties doesn’t exist.Alliance leader Naomi Long said: “I did not expect this morning, that I would be standing here paying tribute to him in these circumstances.

There were times when I debated with Christopher that I tried not to like him afterwards, but I couldn’t. He was such an affable inidual.”The sharp suits, the sharp tongue – it will all be missed at Stormont.But Christopher Stalford, as all those who paid their respects noted, will be even more sorely missed by the family he has left behind.Most ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...The dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadChristopher Stalford’s death: A bright light has gone out in our party and in NI politics, says Sir JeffreyOur everlasting love affair with the song Kenneth Branagh wanted as ‘a message of hope’Top VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest PoliticsSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of border, children waiting for help from NI mental health servicesPortrait showed how important family’s love was for ChristopherKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordChildhood pal of late DUP politician Christopher Stalford: ‘I can’t imagine coming home and not being able to see my friend’LatestCovid- weekly deaths in England and Wales fall for third week in a rowKieran McGeeney: McKenna Cup should be scrapped to make way for longer league season as attendances prove the demandDesi Henry left ‘dumbstruck’ by death of Eoin McCarthy at Killarney Forest RallyCovid-hit Queen cancels planned virtual engagementsHong Kong orders mandatory Covid tests for all residents,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSpecial: Artist Brian John Spencer’s drawing of Christopher StalfordMark BainTwitterEmailFebruary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailThe doors to the Sandy Row office of Christopher Stalford remain closed following his shock and sudden death on Saturday night, but inside, on a wall, hangs a drawing that probably says more about the MLA than words could ever manage.It’s a portrait of a father and his son by well known Belfast artist Brian John Spencer.It’s called ‘The Mask My Father Wore’.The image of a special parental bond was the product of a friendship between artist and subject, and it has struck a chord with those who knew the South Belfast MLA, and those who sparred with him across the Assembly chamber.In the Assembly yesterday, MLAs from across the political ide stood to pay tribute to the DUP man, just , who had risen through the ranks of the party and crafted a profile as one of the most articulate and intelligent defenders of unionism.Perhaps more tellingly, all spoke even more glowingly of Christopher Stalford as the man they came to know away from politics. The pristine suits which perfectly summed up his attention to detail, the cutting wit and, without fail, all lauded the the family man devoted to we Laura and their four children.Painted in , Brian said he was keen to produce a piece artwork focusing on both the pandemic and how much family means.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “I was thinking of who I could use as a subject and having met Christopher and his family several times it was so easy to see he would be the perfect choice,” said Brian.“At the time it wasn’t drawn for attention or publicity. It was simply to show the love between father and son, something that anyone could see so well in Christopher.“I had been following him on social media. Even there it was clear that here was a man in public le for whom family meant so much more.“I always saw him as someone like Bill Clinton or George Best. No matter where you came from that respect was there.“Sometimes someone comes along who you can just sense is in a dferent league.“I got on very well with Christopher,” Brian continued.“I would see him in Belvoir when I lived there and often park outside his office.“Once a week I’d call in for a chat with him, orhe wasn’t around, the staff in his office.“I really enjoyed those chats and enjoyed painting him. I couldn’t think of anyone better to show the love there is between a father and his son.”The artwork wasn’t commissioned, it was just something Brian wanted to do. But a week after dropping it into to Christopher Stalford’s office, it was hanging on the wall.“I think he liked it. He asked me to do a family portrait so he must have,” said Brian.“It was a dream job, in the style Sir John Lavery would have done. It was very hard and stretched me, but I think it came out well. He loved it anyway.“He had also asked meI would do a portrait of one of his daughters, Abigail. She’d told him she would like one. Because of Covid we never got around to arranging it.“It’s still a portrait I would love to do, honour that agreement on his behalf. Maybe some day soon we can make it happen,” he said.Brian tweeted an image of his portrait on Sunday once he learned of Christopher’s sudden death. Very quickly it was spotted, shared and liked as perfectly capturing all that was important in the le of the MLA. “It was just my simple way of paying tribute to a man I had come to know and admire,” he said. “I had no idea it was going to resonate with people who knew him and worked with him.“He was a great supporter of the arts, and a great supporter of my work, for which I will always be grateful,” said Brian.“But I felt compelled to draw him with his son as he was an exceptionally good father.”Brian is a regular contributor to political website Slugger O’Toole, so is well versed in tackling politicians in art form“In an artistic sense I always joked to Christopher that he had a similar profile to Sir Edward Carson,” he added.More of Brian’s work, which also includes landscapes from famous locations around his home city of Belfast, can be viewed at brianjohnspencer or canvasgalleries.Related topicsChristopher StalfordNorthern Ireland AssemblyMore On Christopher StalfordAnti-Protocol rally postponed as ‘mark of respect’ following death of DUP’s Christopher StalfordKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher Stalford PremiumChildhood pal of late DUP politician Christopher Stalford: ‘I can’t imagine coming home and not being able to see my friend’Warm tributes paid across political benches at Stormont to Christopher Stalford PremiumViewpointOpinionDeath of Stalford puts our squabbles into real perspectiveMost ReadShow at Lyric Theatre cut short after cast complain about behaviour of audienceSam McBrideOpinionSteeped in politics from his teens, just days ago Christopher Stalford had been given good news...The dissident funeral, a UVF gun, and the web of criminality that left four men deadChristopher Stalford’s death: A bright light has gone out in our party and in NI politics, says Sir JeffreyOur everlasting love affair with the song Kenneth Branagh wanted as ‘a message of hope’Top VideosPlayStorm Franklin brings sea foam to Portstewart PlayVideo: Sea wall breached as Storm Franklin hits PortstewartPlayDUP MLA Mervyn Storey leads his party’s Assembly team in a prayer and moment of silence for Christopher StalfordLatest PoliticsSinn Fein favours a single .% corporation tax for smaller firms on both sides of border, children waiting for help from NI mental health servicesKey dates in le and political career of the late DUP politician Christopher StalfordChildhood pal of late DUP politician Christopher Stalford: ‘I can’t imagine coming home and not being able to see my friend’Covid testing for NI in doubt after PM ends all restrictionsLatestOil prices surge and stock markets under pressure as crisis mounts in UkraineThird of young people saw wellbeing boost during lockdownJamie Mulgrew: Forget my landmark Linfield appearance, I’m desperate to land another league titleHouse sales down by .% in January compared with a year earlierStephen Robinson explains St Mirren switch after club also considered move for Linfield boss David Healy,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry. We are also very concerned about the lack of adequate consultation with key stakeholders, in particular, the Friends of Down County Museum..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Documents of United Irish leader Thomas Russell  shows rich history held  in Down County Museum  ","story":"MANY people in County Down and beyond will be familiar with the words of Florence Mary Wilsonrsquos popular ballad, The Man from God Knows Where, published in  in her best-known collection of poetry, The Coming of the Earls.Her enigmatic subject was Thomas Russell mdash soldier, social reformer and revolutionary mdash who was hanged outside what is now Down County Museum in October .An intimate of Theobald Wolfe Tone, Russell was posted to Belfast as an ensign in the th Regiment of Foot in  and became a founding member of the Society of United Irishmen the following year.Associated with the development of the United Irishmenrsquos insurrectionary strategy in the mid-s, Russell journeyed across Co Down mobilising support for what was expected to be a rebellion supported by French arms. Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum. One can only hope that a broader awareness of the worrying impact of the Councilrsquos vision will create a clamour whereby the lsquoWrong should cease and the Right prevailrsquo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Drumaness A and B square off  ","story":"THE ladies of Drumaness B, still buoyant from their win over Strangford B, were unable to repeat another giant killing act against their club-mates, Drumaness A.But in a good glamoured match attended by the league secretary, they can be pleased with their team performance while the result was never in doubt.The title holders conceding  points to the B teammade sure that they got enough points in every game to stay ahead of the have-a-go opposition.Pat Mulholland started the ball rolling with a  pointwinning margin against Philomena Rogan before Charlie Murray added another  points in his match with Katy Rice and Hugh Scott collected a similar winning margin over Norma Gilgunn for an overall score of  points.The ladies were more resolute in the next round of matches and were more content in their performance than points and finished the match with a respectable score overall..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"East Down AC  ","story":"LAST Wednesday some of the East Down AC juniors headed to Mallusk for the Ulster Schoolsrsquo Cross Country Championships.On this occasion they were running in school colours rather than the red and yellow of East Down AC but several of the club coaches were in attendance and watching with interest.The athletes had to qualy for the honour of racing at this level through an inidual top  place or as part of a team that came in the top three at the district qualiers.Although the course was fairly flat and the ground mostly firm underfoot, the long flat stretches were interspersed with a sharp, slippy rises and muddy turns so runners had to choose whether to run wide for safer footing or risk slipping by following the shortest route.The squally showers and very strong gusty winds were an added challenge.Jessica Martinrepresenting Victoria College Belfast over a distance of m came th out of a field of  runners in a time of ..Year Nine girlshad four EDAC runners in the pack Erin Moore, Cara Napier and Charlotte Barr.

A summer festival could focus on this heritage which can be linked with the increase in walking in the Mournes.Cllr Clarke believes there should also be a nautical aspect of a new summer festival, celebrating the rich maritime history of the area.He added: ldquoThere is potential to build on the resortrsquos outdoor water sports or perhaps launch a regional dish competition, opportunities which present the chance to showcase everything is good about Newcastle for visitors and locals alike..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Final four spot for Down High  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos first XV entertained familiar rivals Omagh Academy in Downpatrick on Saturday morning for their quarter-final tie in the Danske Bank Subsidiary Shield.The two sides met in the opening fixture of the season with Omagh winning - on that occasion.The game didnrsquot get off to an ideal start for Down High when in the first minute, number eight, Rhodri Phillips, made an uncharacteristic error that provided Omagh with a  to cross for an unconverted try in the corner.Within minutes Phillips had made amends when he finished off an excellent Down High multi-phase attack scoring under the posts and leaving himself with a straightforward conversion which he duly slotted over.Omagh, who were playing with the strong wind on their backs in the opening half, applied most of the pressure for the next period of the game and after Joseph Dooley was carded for an accumulation of penalties by the home side, Omagh opted for the posts and added three points to regain the lead.In the th minute, a Down attack that was reminiscent of the one that had led to their opening score, brought play deep into Omagh territory where captain, Cameron McCaughey, showed great footwork and power to e over under the sticks for a try which Phillips easily converted.Omagh were not to leave the first half without reply. With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt. He said the type of person who is a hunting, shooting and fishing man, like something from the Irish RM, is a major tourist attraction. It is a section of the countryside and a major cultural aspect which should be preserved.He pointed out thatthe hunt is successful, it will result in a smelly bag being torn apart.DOWNPATRICK ndash An alternative line has been suggested this week for the poundm Downpatrick town centre by-pass.Down Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, is suggesting that the road could be constructed along part of the route of the former railway line.Mr Biggerstaff believes thatthe line is adopted by the Department of Environment, it will considerably reduce the costs of the provision.ldquoI would envisage incorporating part of the old railway line embankment as the foundation for a new roads system, said Mr Biggerstaff.He expressed concern that the Government-backed regeneration of Downpatrick will be hampered by the failure to resolve the traffic problem.ldquoThere will be no point in regenerating Downpatrickthere isnrsquot road network facility to make use of, she said.ldquoAfter meeting officials of the Department, it is my view that the by-pass will eventually go ahead.

The Eastern Health Board has announced that intends closing Mourne House residential home for the elderly, despite a strong protest lobby.A spokesman for the Southern Board said last weekrsquos vote was ldquototally unanimous and followed preliminary discussions with staff and patientsrsquo relatives.The two-storey building, which was built in the rsquos, was turned into a holiday home for the mentally handicapped in . At one stage it provided holiday accommodation for  patients.With the Board running down its holiday operations at Navan House in recent years, it is now being used as an extension of the Boardrsquos mental health hospital in Armagh and contains  patients.The spokesman said the decision to close is in line with Board policy aimed at ing people to the community.ldquoNavan House costs around pound, a year to run. The Board believes this money could be better spent developing community services, he continued.The spokesman said a final decision will only be taken following consultations with patients, staff, local councillors and community groups.ldquoThere is a general recognition that we should have fewer long-stay patients in mental hospitals. There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh.

Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September.

Picture by Brian LittleI first met him at Stormont in the late s, when he was still at school, and a frequent visitor to Stormont with his friend and constituency predecessor Mark Robinson MLA.As a student he was a bit of a political geek, with a depth of knowledge and analysis of local, national and international politics that belied his youth, equally at home discussing the latest developments in Washington or Westminster, as he was with Sandy Row or Stormont . As with many of us who were involved in politics from a young age, he initially came across as a bit square and we often joked that he started off middle aged and became younger with age.He came from a close and loving family, but was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth, and achieved his many successes through hard work and ability. Indeed, from early meetings his intelligence, talent and potential shone through, which was why as soon as I joined the DUP in , I headhunted him to work for me, first as a student, and then after graduation, becoming his first employer.    \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

High Sherf, Deputy Mayor and MLA filled me with pride but given his abilities no little surprise. When he became Principal Deputy Speaker he was filled with joy, not least because he knew the pleasure it would give his much loved family.Christopher was someone who cared about his city and his community. Although he moved house several times, it was always within Belfast itself. He was passionately committed to delivering for his constituents, and was a fearsome debater, who could deliver an argument with clarity, passion and wit. He was a true Unionist and Orangeman through and through, andyou had cut him in two he would have had DUP written through him like a stick of rock.He was not however a two dimensional political ideologue. Although he never swayed in his unionist convictions, his friendships and courtesy cut across the political spectrum. Indeed one of his sparring partners from Queens, Mary Durkan who became an SDLP Councillor in Londonderry, would be sure to ask me any time I met her “How is Stalfie doing ” The breadth of tributes paid to Christopher is a measure of the respect he engendered throughout the political world and beyond.Christopher was a Bon viveur and good company, a man with a wide hinterland of interests, and hidden depths as anyone who has heard him perform Sinatra in karaoke can testy. He was also a man of quiet, untrumpeted kindness. When my mother died a few months ago, knowing that I would be alone, he insisted that I spend Christmas Day with him and his family, That was the Christopher that lay behind the public image.Above all he was a devoted family man, who glowed with love and pride for his beloved we Laura and their four children. The country has lost a great representative, I have lost a great friend, but it is the loss of a husband, father, son and brother that will be most keenly felt and cruelly missed.

Pointing out that it has been a triumph for many of the UK competitors even to qualy, she gives this optimistic assessment of winter sport: “The biggest misconception is that to ski, you have to have a lot of money, and nowadays — it’s not. I started on a dry slope in Bromley, south London, aged four, skiing.”The UK has in the last  years achieved massive success in the summer Olympics and in sports such as tennis, above all because it began to make training in them a national priority using lottery funding. This saw Britain go from getting an average of  or so medals in the s to + latterly.Our geographic location means that we are unlikely to become a leading winter sport nation but we can yet improve.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing.“He was a genuine and funny person, who was dedicated to public service.

He just loved politics and engagement with the public and he was an excellent barometer of where public opinion within unionism rested.”He said a “shadow of loss” hangs over the party.Mr Paisley added: “He rose very quickly through the ranks of the party achieving electoral success and ultimately making the South Belfast assembly seat his own. He was cut out for the deputy speaker role and would have no doubt climbed to higher office.“I last spoke to Chris in the middle of the past week after his appearance on the media.

He said: “I’m sure you meant well, but that last line is, at best, misjudged, and at worst, is offensive to his family who would rather he was with them.”But Alliance leader Naomi Long lept to her defence.“Please, stop attacking Carl Lockhart over her tweet, today of all days,” she tweeted. “She is grieving.” Ms Long noted Carla was quoting Philippians v “about the faithful being torn between service in this le and being with Christ in eternity”. She added: “It’s a very common Christian quote, which his family will understand.” Her tweet attracted over  likes.Similarly, SDLP leader Colum Eastwood branded the criticism as “disgusting”, adding that it “shows how this  can be so poisonous”. He added: “Many people seem to converse in a way that they would never dream of doing in person. I just don’t get it. Solidarity with Carla Lockhart.”Ms Lockhart told the News Letter that she stands by her comment. “Christopher’s faith, shared by Laura, his beloved we, offers that promise of eternal le in glory when the Lord calls us home,” she said.“That time is not of our choosing - Christopher’s love and zest for le, and most of all his love for his family - would have meant he no doubt would have loved to have lived a long le. But we know that was not God’s plan.“For the family - in the depths of such sorrow - there is great comfort in that surety that Christopher is in his heavenly home. The surety of our eternal home however does not remove the sadness for those left behind.”Another tweeter, Fred Crawford, also came to her defence. He said: “The comments underneath show the widespread illiteracy regarding Christianity in our society. All Christians believe that to be with Christ is far better, that is the hope of the faith and why we believe what we do. This view should be respected right now.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThey have been called upon not to strike this week following the new proposals, with walkouts currently planned for Wednesday and Thursday. vw,vw,px, px\"Protesters outside Sheffield Girls’ School Earlier in February, teachers from  independent schools within the Girls’ Day School Trustbegan six days of strike action throughout this month and early March, with around , members of the NEU teaching union involved over the trust’s proposed withdrawal from the Teachers’ Pension Scheme.The NEU, the recognised union for staff across the  independent schools run by the GDST, has said that exiting the scheme would leave affected teachers % worse off on average in terms of their annual pension payments.On Tuesday, the GDST said that its trustees had “carefully considered” feedback collected from teachers during the consultation period around pension changes, and proposed a “strong updated offer which will meet teachers’ concerns”.“Under the proposal, teaching staff will now stay within the TPS for a longer period and all GDST staff in independent schools will be awarded a pay rise,” the GDST said.The new proposals would mean teachers could stay in the TPS until September , .The trust said that a “strong alternative” to the TPS was being proposed, with % employer contributions “alongside other benefits”.It said the new scheme included an option where teachers could expect a drawdown pension that would “match or exceed” what they would receive from the TPS pension beyond an average le expectancy.“The Trustees have a legal duty to secure the GDST’s future and deliver on its charitable mission to reach as many girls as possible,” the GDST said.“They have concluded that the additional annual financial burden of £m created by increased TPS costs is unsustainable and therefore the GDST cannot remain within the scheme indefinitely.”.removeA growing number of private schools have left the TPS after the Government raised the rate of employers’ contributions by % in .While state schools were covered for the increase by the Government, private schools were not. More than  private schools have given notice to leave the scheme since .The GDST trustees said they knew teachers would “want time to consider the new proposal and we are ready to talk these through in detail”.They said they were committed to reaching a settlement, and had invited the NEU to meet with them, but had also “requested that they call off this week’s proposed industrial action while these discussions take place”.“With the Trustees’ decision announced today, the pursuit of strike action with a new proposal on the table would cause unnecessary disruption for students,” they said.They added that they “care deeply about our teachers” and would not have put proposals forward unless they felt they were “absolutely necessary” for the long-term future of the trust.They said the sustainability of the trust’s future would enable them to “continue to provide an excellent and affordable independent education for our students” and at the same time offer teachers a “comfortable retirement”.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “It is very disappointing that the GDST has not reversed their decision to withdraw from the Teachers Pension Scheme .”“If they were really listening to the strength of feeling from their staff, they would realise that short term financial sweeteners offer no compensation for the long-term security of the TPS.”“There is no financial imperative for GDST to insist on removing staff from the TPS next year. The NEU will of course enter the negotiations with GDST which we have been asking for. However, this offer gives our members no reassurance that the TPS will remain in place and the strike action will go ahead on this week.”.push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Private schools call for end to strike action with updated pension offer article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We were delighted when we could reopen them safely in accordance with government guidance and are looking forward to welcoming our visitors in . “To do this successfully, we want to grow our team of shop volunteers and are looking for people who enjoy interacting with others, can help us to provide a high level of customer service and ensure our shops continue to be friendly and welcoming places.”To find out more, go to https:volunteering.rnli.org vacancy Read more: Social housing meeting in Cloughmills"},{"url":null,"title":"storm franklin latest list of roads closed across northern ireland ","story":"Pupils’ plea for drivers to go slow   Extra Covid- booster for over s and those at high riskNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessRead ThisNewsWeatherStorm Franklin: latest list of roads closed across Northern IrelandA number of roads across Northern Ireland are still closed this eveningdue to the recent wet and windy weather conditions.By Valerie MartinMonday, st February , : pm  \"       \"  Road users have also been urged to be aware of surface water on many roads due to heavy rain and are advised to slow down and drive with care.The list of road closures or where there are dficulties is as follows :       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fabfabdcfffbcd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_cdfdbbedab   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have.

The damage done to local food production will require a reliance on food imports that would exacerbate global emissions and increase prices for the consumer. The impact would be particularly felt in rural towns and communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods. They are calling on Assembly MLAs to recty the Bill by making meaningful amendments that are in line with the scientic evidence and that support their local communities who rely on the sector for their livelihoods. The organisations behind this warning are the Dairy Council for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Food  Drink AssociationNorthern Ireland Grain Trade Association , Northern Ireland Meat Exporters Association , the Livestock and Meat Commission , the Ulster Farmers Union . Speaking on behalf of this supply chain alliance, Conall Donnelly, Chief Executive of NIMEA said: “To be very clear, our collective members are in support of Climate Change legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We want to play our part. We are already investing in and implementing carbon-reducing technologies right across our supply chain and will continue to do so. Because of our natural grass advantage, we already have a world-class reputation for sustainable food production. Our high-quality beef, lamb and dairy produce is reared with care on small family farms utilising natural grass and is the envy of many countries around the world. We believe Northern Ireland has the potential to be a shining light in sustainable food production. We want to work with policy makers to get this right for the environment and the local economy. That means having realistic and science-based climate change targets relevant to Northern Ireland so that we can continue to be part of the solution to climate change.” David Brown, Deputy President of the UFU said, “ passed without further amendments, this legislation would not follow the expert advice from scientists that make up the International Panel of Climate Change and the UK’s Climate Change Committee. It could unnecessarily obliterate tens of thousands of jobs as well as threaten consumer access to affordable, quality food. Perversely, food may need to be imported from where which would simply increase global emissions. “This Bill also has the potential to damage rural towns and communities who depend on our sector for their livelihoods. But it will affect us all as consumers when we are no longer able to access local fresh food that is produced to high environmental and animal welfare standards. We are asking politicians to work with us. We want to tackle climate change in a way that helps protect the environment and maintains the unique economic and social role that agriculture and food production has on this island.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fbebeaefddee   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ecaaebcdfdf   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645454612923.jpg--covid_19___mon_21st_february_figures.jpg?164545461200","title":"covid  mon st february figures ","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related death and , new positive test results.
