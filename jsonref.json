He is a very knowledgeable man about many, many areas. \u0027He\u0027s very concerned about the environment and about architecture.

I thought she might have had enough of talking to strangers – everyone wanted to meet her – so I decided not to bother her by saying hello. I was wrong about that: Judith liked meeting people. She was charming and funny and, mercifully, even though it was a small talk sort of event, she wasn’t a small talk sort of person.If I could sum Judith up in just one anecdote it would be this one. She was telling me about a family photograph. Her parents are standing looking quite serious, four-year-old Judith and her brother, Michael, are both sitting on tricycles.“I remember feeling very proud and pleased because I had just learned to ride a tricycle and now here I was having my photograph taken. When I looked into the camera I was wondering to myself: ‘Do I look like someone who can ride a tricycle?’”I marvel at this tiny child willing her expression to communicate something so abstract, imagining it actually might be possible for someone to one day look into this photograph and see something in that child’s face that tells you, she is a girl who can ride a tricycle. She is not thinking: “Is the tricycle the clue?” but rather “Is it the expression on my face that gives it away?”And here is Judith aged four thinking exactly like an illustrator. Judith could not only recall these moments huge and minuscule, but she could take you with her, lead you right into that memory as if you were there in the first place, discussing it back and forth, making it a conversation, a shared thing.When she told the story of the tricycle (and I made her tell it more than a few times) her face would light up, full of wonder at the sophisticated thinking of the child she once was – not ever believing it peculiar to her but understanding that all children have such sophisticated thoughts.When grown up, we are inclined to forget how interestingly our minds once knitted ideas together we tend to walk past the seemingly ordinary details that used to intrigue us. But Judith did not forget, she valued it all and continued to observe those small close-up things which really explain who we are.Several years ago, when we went to tea with Judith, my daughter, then aged four, whispered very loudly in my ear: “I want to see Judith’s bedroom.” Judith immediately got up from the table and said: “But of course you do.”Because why would you not want to see? For the bedroom, the kitchen, the whole house (which we were shown) tells you a lot about the person who lives there – why not understand your host better by looking at her things? And why not understand your small guest better by watching to see what catches her eye?It is this way of thinking, this way of looking, that made Judith such an exquisite illustrator and writer and such a fascinating person to know. She never forgot to be curious and she never failed to delight in someone else’s curiosity. And this of course is what keeps you young. And Judith was ever young.I will miss those conversations, always interesting and above all, always funny. She rang me once to tell me she was to have a cataract operation, only she said: “I keep getting the word mixed up and wanting to say cormorants.”We would chat about our work. Occasionally she’d tell me about a piece of writing she was struggling with, never pretending things came easily: “Oh I find the writing so hard, how do you do it?” There was never any suggestion that she was somehow on a different plane from me. We would talk about friends and work and things going on in the world, or a new eraser she had recently purchased. And of course the evening that we met David Beckham and his family at her favourite local restaurant, and he was so delighted to meet her he had paid for all our dinners.“Wasn’t that fun?” she said, when we got back to her house, laughing and sipping our large tumblers of whisky. Time had fallen away, and she was giggling as if she were no more than 20, and suddenly we were all 20 again – just back from a really good night out, one of those nights you just don’t want to end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983f6577f839aa5b26ac4c51c4ba6f53da6a1291/0_0_4819_2142/master/4819.jpg?width=465\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cdece5153ff7d53ec64fa4bcb9ed33e 465w","title":"whistleblower reveals financial ombudsman service in disarray","story":"Consumers are waiting up to two years for adjudications, according to FOS documentsCan you trust the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) to resolve your dispute with a bank or insurer? A whistleblower has told  Money that a “disastrous” management reorganisation has left the service in disarray, with the public waiting as long as two years to get justice.The whistleblower, a senior staff member at the FOS who wishes to remain anonymous, alleges that:• Consumers sending complex complaints to FOS can wait 10 months before a file is even picked up and examined.• The waiting time for pension disputes is seven months.• Wronged consumers can wait up to two years until their claims are finally adjudicated.• The number of unresolved general claims (non-PPI) that remain unresolved a year after being received now stands at 15,551.• Managers expected case handlers to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, but the real figure is 1.7.Documents shown to Money by the whistleblower indicate that a consumer with a complex dispute with their mortgage company or home insurer faces a wait of about 10 months before the file is even picked up and looked for the first time.The service was set up to help consumers get fair treatment from the banks, insurers, pension and other financial services providers. Staff act as independent adjudicators over disputes, and their findings are binding on the companies concerned. It’s free for consumers to use, but the company concerned must pay £550.However, the service has been beset with problems in recent years. In 2018, an undercover reporter for Channel 4’s Dispatches found that staff with inadequate training or financial competence were judging cases – sometimes without, it claimed, properly reading case files.Several staff have since turned whistleblower in a bid to get the Financial Conduct Authority to take action. Their comments chime with complaints to Money from readers who, having been through the arbitration process, claim the service is not fit for purpose.According to the latest whistleblower, things are even worse now than a year ago. A 2016 reorganisation changed the way cases are distributed, he says. Instead of using expert adjudicators to deal solely with disputes in their specialist areas, new investigators were expected to work across all areas of finance. The result, he says, has been a huge drop in the service’s performance in what it calls its “general cases”, leaving a growing list of people awaiting what can be life-changing sums of money.Complaints are initially judged by an“investigator” and only escalated to the experienced ombudsmen if either party appeals against the first decision.The queue of complaints waiting for an ombudsman’s decision has increased dramatically in recent years and now stands at 15,592.“Managers believed their changes would enable investigators to resolve 4.5 complaints a week, which turned out to be a gross misjudgment. The system has never delivered more than 2.6 case closures per week and the current output is now 1.7,” he says.“The organisation is facing problems beyond simply the backlogs. The resolved complaints per investigator per week is less than half of what it was claimed would be achieved.And the cost of resolving each complaint now exceeds £1,100 – placing the long-term sustainability of the organisation in doubt.”The end of the tsunami of PPI claims that swamped the service was set to be an opportunity to start clearing the backlog in complaints. However, improved service times have not emerged, he says.“This year we intended to resolve 50,000 more complaints than we received – 510,000 versus 460,000 – to deal with the large backlog of cases which had developed, particularly in general casework as a result of the failed restructure. We have just learned that the target has been cut to 310,000.”The delays are particularly hard on those with buildings insurance complaints, including subsidence and high-value claims that are taking 10 months before anyone starts to look at the complaint.“The queue for an ombudsman’s decision is, if anything, worse than the queue at the front end of the process. In areas such as buildings insurance and pensions, complainants are now regularly having to wait over a year from the time they request an ombudsman’s decision. Putting the two queues together, it can be seen that if one were to complain today about, for example, a buildings insurance claim for subsidence, it is likely to be over two years before a decision is issued. The complainant just has to hope their house hasn’t fallen down in the meantime,” he says.A spokeswoman for the FOS said: “Last year an independent review of the Financial Ombudsman Service concluded that we provided an ‘effective and essential service’. We have come off the back of our busiest year for five years and are working to get people answers on their cases as quickly as possible. Our team work hard to make sure every complaint we handle is investigated thoroughly, to ensure we reach a fair result for people and businesses.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e1c25340386445632106ddb6b69a8117666a1e7/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aabff8a1f67041a06fd1ba524a8033b6","title":"around the world in a day without leaving shenzhen a photo essay","story":"For Chinese tourists who cannot travel, the Window of the World theme park offers versions of 130 global attractions. Photojournalist Anthony Micallef took a whistlestop tour More than 3 million visitors a year flock to the Window of the World theme park in the megacity of Shenzhen to see 130 copies of the world’s largest tourist sites gathered in a single place.For Chinese tourists who may not be able to travel out of the country this is their only chance of seeing the New York skyline, the pyramids of Giza or the Taj Mahal – or smaller replicas of them, at least.The visit typically begins at the metro station, modelled in the shape of the Louvre pyramid in Paris, designed by Chinese-American architect IM Pei. Most tourists then head for the nearby splendours of European architecture: the Acropolis of Athens, the Palace of Versailles, Buckingham Palace and Tower Bridge from London, or Italy’s Leaning Tower of Pisa.Moving to Asia, the Angkor Wat temple is always popular with visitors. The Hindu temple complex in Cambodia is the largest religious monument in the world, although the copy here is somewhat smaller. Mount Fuji and the Iranian city of Persepolis are also packed with visitors. A few hundred metres further on, Sydney Opera House is a step or two from the sacred sandstone rock of Uluru.Next up is the Manhattan skyline, Rio de Janeiro’s Christ the Redeemer statue, and the monumental stone figures of Easter Island – all without ever leaving Shenzhen.Many visitors buy a fake passport which the theme park hostesses will stamp with as many foreign visas as you want.The theme park also offers boat trips down the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, and a cable car ride across the Amazon rain forest. If you want to cool down there is a climate-controlled indoor ski centre with 4,000 sq m of artificial snow slopes.If you look closely, many of the reproductions appear a little kitsch and the decor outdated. Some visitors complain a few need a new paint job, or even a total rebuild.But putting aside aesthetic disappointments, the park does allow the visitor to learn a lot about the real sites and their histories. I emerge knowing that the Moscow Kremlin was first a residence of the tsars, then of the leaders of the USSR, and is nowadays the official residence of Russia’s President Putin.I learn that the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption of Pisa is located in Piazza dei Miracoli, which is a Unesco world heritage site that includes the famous leaning tower. Finally, we learn that the gate of Ishtar in Iraq was one of the eight gates of Babylon, built in 580BC on the orders of King Nebuchadnezzar II and dedicated to the goddess Ishtar.Many tourists at the Shenzhen park come from modest backgrounds. Some cannot afford international travel and others are forbidden to leave the country because their “citizen score” is too low. Often they are seeing representations of these monuments for the first time.The park is unrealistic to say the least: in truth the presidents on Mount Rushmore, for example, look out on to South Dakota, but at Window of the World they overlook Washington’s Capitol Building, some 1,600km away. The Shenzhen Eiffel Tower rises to a third of its real size (108m instead of 324m), but you can climb it and admire the view of the pyramids of Giza in Egypt.On the other hand, the park allows visitors an opening to a world that would otherwise be inaccessible and unknown to them.The ability to eat Mexican food while walking in the Cambodian temple of Angkor Wat is the novel offer of a park which slashes both distance and time. By the end of the visit, the landmarks are blurred: we toured the planet by jumping over continents and centuries.

The documents show how, for years, the American public and the world were persistently and deliberately misled by the Bush and Obama administrations over the chaotic conduct and unwinnable nature of the Afghan war.If such behaviour does not amount to abuse of presidential power, if this does not qualify as “high crimes and misdemeanors”, then pray, what does?The 18-year-long war has killed tens of thousands of Afghan civilians and US, Nato and Afghan soldiers, and cost upwards of £760bn. Yet the Taliban are on a roll, the Kabul government is on life support, and, despite what Trump claims about talks, there is no end in sight.Trump may yet be impeached for his particular transgressions. But when it comes to lying, he belongs to a broad White House tradition stretching back to Richard Nixon, LBJ and numerous predecessors. The 1971 Pentagon papers detailed how the true inanities of Vietnam were also concealed from view. Whether it’s coups, cover-ups or conspiracies, most modern American presidents have a lot to hide.This propensity for fibbing and fabricating, especially over national security, is evidently not confined to the US. It seems some politicians feel a superior responsibility not to alarm or agitate the public.More often, they are motivated by a desire to justify their choices and conceal their mistakes. Tony Blair’s infamous “dodgy dossier”, published before the 2003 Iraq invasion, was a classic of the genre.Yet a full understanding of how the Afghan calamity has been sustained for so long requires a closer look. “Lying politicians” are not the whole story. As the papers show, a parallel is found in the reluctance of military leaders, high and low, to admit Afghanistan is mission impossible. Beguiled by groupthink, they are drawn into a web of deceit and half-truths. They swallow what the Vietnam war correspondent Neil Sheehan called the “bright shining lie” of self-delusion.Gen Stanley McChrystal, the US commander in 2009-10, chose the path to glory – and appeared genuinely to believe his plan would work. He demanded big troop increases, telling Obama: “We are going to win”. Briefing journalists in Kabul in 2009, he said better training for an expanded Afghan army was the key to success. But Obama’s subsequent troop “surge” flopped, Afghan forces are still floundering almost a decade later, violence this year is at record levels – and McChrystal now runs a private consultancy.It’s clear there are many other reasons why the Afghan war has been allowed to drag on. The absence of effective congressional scrutiny is one. Members of the Senate armed services committee declared themselves “truly shocked” last week by the Afghan papers’ revelations. Yet if they had been doing their jobs properly, they would already have known about the lies. Maybe they did.Inertia also played a role. The sense that nobody is really watching has bred an unhealthy sense of impunity, most damaging in respect of alleged war crimes committed by US and CIA-backed forces. For corrupt officials in Kabul, meanwhile, the war, and its accompanying flow of US aid dollars, is a profitable racket they have zero interest in ending. The real scandal is the Pentagon often knew about the scams but did nothing.The fact that Bush in 2001 failed to set out clear war aims, or define success, meant reaching a decisive, agreed end-point was always going to be problematic. Repeated strategic reviews and tactical shifts hampered the military effort, to the point that not losing was more important than winning.Even Trump, the great deceiver, balks at declaring victory while the Taliban, plus resurgent al-Qaida and Islamic State, still control more than half the country.Yet blame for this war without end must also be shared by the people in whose name it is fought – the American (and British) publics. Where is the fury, where is the disgust, where is the shame over a futile conflict that, for nearly two decades, has killed and maimed children while wasting the lives of brave service members? Who voted for these ongoing massacres? The uglier question is: who cares?It’s true that Afghanistan was never a “popular” cause. It was sparked by a thirst for revenge for the 911 attacks, never a sound basis for war, and morphed through inattention into regime change and occupation. It’s true, too, that fashionable Blairite ideas about humanitarian intervention, democracy promotion and nation-building died a death in the alleyways of Baghdad and Falluja.But the uncomfortable reality is also that Afghanistan is what is called a limited or “contained” war, fought in a distant land by professional volunteer armies, not Vietnam-era conscripts, in which the costs, human and otherwise, are somehow deemed “acceptable”. It has scant direct impact or relevance to most people at home in the US and Europe. In fact, it barely registers.Afghanistan grinds on thanks, in part, to the passive complicity of all those who have allowed a post-Iraq sense of hopelessness and cynicism about the effectiveness of political activism and anti-war protest to overwhelm their sense of outrage. Vietnam provoked a terrible roar of anger, as did Iraq, only too briefly. Afghanistan produces only an embarrassed silence – and Syria and Yemen mere plaintive wails.It’s worth asking whether collective indifference to such slaughter is a byproduct of the ongoing demoralisation, degradation and disengagement of the western democracies. Like an unwelcome asylum seeker knocking at the door, Afghanistan’s misery is kept at arm’s length.

The half of Britain that wants to leave the EU was united around Boris Johnson while the half that still wants to remain in the EU was ided against itself, and weighed down by the electoral liability called Jeremy Corbyn.If the deceptive but effective three-word slogan “take back control” won the 2016 referendum, so the equally effective and deceptive three-word slogan “get Brexit done” won this election. Even if voters knew somewhere in the back of their minds that it was too good to be true, in their hearts they wanted it to be. And let’s be honest: even the most passionate of us remainers had some hidden “get Brexit done” corner of our souls.But now I answer Auden with a great saying from the leader of Poland’s struggle for independence in the early 20th century, Józef Piłsudski: “To be defeated and not give up, that is victory. To be victorious and rest on your laurels, that is defeat.”One of the many unpleasant experiences awaiting us in Britain over the next months is to hear silver-tongued demagogues such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, who have done more than anyone to tear this country apart, now smoothly repeating the mantra of “bringing the country together”. Yet the likely consequence of Brexit is not just that the United Kingdom will be weaker, poorer and less influential, but that it will in effect cease to exist as a single state. That is the other clear signal from this election.Under Johnson’s EU withdrawal deal, Northern Ireland will already be in a different economic and legal space from England, Scotland and Wales. Now Northern Ireland has, for the first time, elected more nationalist than unionist MPs. While it will probably remain constitutionally part of the UK for some time to come, since a formal break could return the province to bloodshed, in reality it will be ever more integrated with the rest of the island of Ireland.Scotland, meanwhile, has voted as emphatically for the Scottish National party (SNP) as England did for the Conservatives – and that on an explicit SNP commitment to a second Scottish referendum in which Nicola Sturgeon’s party will argue for Scotland to leave the British union in order to rejoin the European one. As an Englishman, I want Scotland to stay with us, to enhance the strength, ersity and openness of the multinational nation that is Britain. There are also strong economic and prudential arguments for Scotland to stick with England. But if I were Scottish, I would now probably vote for independence, knowing that small countries generally do rather well inside the EU. If Johnson continues to deny the Scots the right to a second referendum, that will make them even more likely to eventually vote for independence, when the opportunity does arise.That result would take us back to the 17th century, before the 1707 union, and some would even say back to the 16th century, when only England and Wales were united under one sovereign. There is a huge irony here. Brexit, which has been fuelled at the top by English post-imperial delusions of grandeur, is the very thing that will probably end up demolishing even the original, smallest English empire, the one embracing these islands.All this will take years to unfold, and the final denouement is not inevitable. Maybe the Scots will after all stick with the devil they know. But it is not too soon for us liberals – in the broadest sense – to start fighting the battle of England. Brexit is at heart an English nationalist project. The flag of St George, the language, the mystique, the emotional appeal of England and Englishness have been misappropriated by nationalists and xenophobes, not to mention those even further to the right, such as Tommy Robinson once of the soi-disant English Defence League.But England is so much bigger and better than that. Even on its own, England would still be a fair-sized European country, with extraordinary strengths in creative industries, world-class media and universities, financial services, the cosmopolitan republic of greater London, sport, medical science and digital innovation. It has an exceptional, continuous history of 10 centuries as a nation with its own laws and traditions of self-government.It is also the country of John Milton, John Lilburne, John Stuart Mill, Charles Dickens and George Orwell: open-minded, bold, tolerant and big-hearted. For all the changes wrought by the centuries, we can still recognise the people described by Milton in 1644: “A nation not slow and dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point the highest that human capacity can soar to.” Enriched and enlivened by decades of immigration, we are still that nation, for these characteristics are cultural, not predetermined by birth. Unfortunately we are again, as Orwell wrote in 1941, “a family with the wrong members in control”. But “still, it is a family”.The battle to keep Britain in the EU is lost the battle for a European England has only just begun. When we remainers marched in our hundreds of thousands through the streets of London, bearing our improvised posters and European flags, we were not just defending British membership in a particular set of European institutions. We were also defending a certain idea of Britain and, within that, a certain idea of England: open, tolerant, internationalist, civic and civil, attentive to the social foundations of inidual liberty and not just to its raw economic expression. These are values we share with millions of other Europeans.In this sense, we were also standing up for a European England. And we can do so still. In this hour of defeat I feel impelled to say, with Orwell: I believe in England, and I believe that we shall go forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/530c12c49df3b812dd80f118d5cb4b5837830e72/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbfef70c0d9ac6725cc91c2840146ec7","title":"labour meltdown decades govern votes","story":"The party has no God-given right to expect votes, let alone to govern. It needs to renew its contract with its baseOn the really painful days in politics, most commentary isn’t worth the name. It’s not analysis, it’s score-settling party political broadcasts for the I-told-you-so brigade, rushed out by people who won’t admit to ever getting a single thing wrong themselves.So it will go this weekend. You’ll read that Labour’s wipeout was only down to Brexit, by those who won’t admit a flaw in Jeremy Corbyn and his noodling mess of a campaign. Or that it was all the Labour leader’s fault, said by remainers who have seen the position they urged on him blown to bits. It was both, of course. Ask voters in those seats that have just gone blue for the first time since the 1930s, or the Labour would-bes who tried canvassing them. If you want to play election Cluedo, then Corbyn and Brexit go together like Colonel Mustard with the candlestick. But when a party descends into civil war, the factions at each others’ throats rarely bother looking up at the rest of the country.To clear the decks, here’s my confession. I never foresaw the scale of this wipeout – and what it spells for our already failing economy, fractured society and battered democracy frankly scares me. Yet the reporting I’ve done – both in this election and before – made me almost sure Labour was going to lose, and in precisely those areas that are all over the front pages. What were called its heartlands, at least until Thursday night. The Bolsovers, the Bishop Aucklands. The un-metropolitan, unfashionable, never-kissed-a-Tory land that would, as the old saw goes, elect a donkey if it wore a red rosette.And I can say with certainty that this week’s meltdown is the culmination of trends that stretch back decades. They were Corbyn’s poisoned inheritance, not his creation – but any leader who wants to win back those seats will have to deal with them better than he managed.For decades, their party took much of the north, the Midlands and Wales as its birthright. It was the “red wall” that would repel invading Tory forces. As one Labour county councillor in Derbyshire, the region that lost Dennis Skinner as an MP on Thursday night, told me: “They barely bothered to campaign.” While the party bigwigs threw their weight about, the mines and the manufacturers, the steel and the shipbuilding were snuffed out. With them went the culture of Labourism: the bolshy union stewards, the self-organised societies, most of the local newspapers. Practically any institution that might incubate a working-class provincial political identity was bulldozed.In North East Derbyshire last month, I saw up close what was left: warehouses and care work. Bullying bosses, zero-hours contracts, poverty pay and social security top-ups. Smartphones to tell you whether you have a shift that morning, and Facebook to give you the news, or some dishonest fragment of it. Across the UK, mines were turned into museums, factories swapped for call centres, meaningful local government replaced by development quangos.And what was Labour’s response? Tony Blair and Gordon Brown pretended some new skills-based economy lay around the corner and parachuted their own chosen people into these safe seats. Thinktankers, union HQ bureaucrats, ex-student politicians: all found careers and weekend homes for themselves.David Miliband swung from the Institute for Public Policy Research to Blair’s office to MP for South Shields, – which, as a longstanding Labour parliamentarian told me yesterday morning, “he couldn’t even find on a map”. Last week Miliband claimed on Twitter: “The biggest Labour challenge is not the angst of the middle class … it is the disbelief of the working class.” This tribune of the Tyneside proletariat now works 3,000 miles away at a New York-based charity that in 2017 reportedly paid him £680,000.What did such smooth-cheeked careerists offer their constituents? Head pats about the “white working class” and their “legitimate concerns”. Never mind that the working class might also be brown.Even as the working class were marginalised politically and destroyed economically, New Labour patronised them into apathy. As the Oxford political scientists James Tilley and Geoffrey Evans argue, the “decline of class-based voting was driven by Labour’s shift to the political centre ground”. Meanwhile, the big gap in the electoral market that opened up was for a party offering a welfare state with reactionary social policy. That was Nigel Farage now it’s Boris Johnson. What won on Thursday night wasn’t Conservatism: it was Faragism. The Tories’ key personnel come from Vote Leave and, just as in that campaign, are happy to play with racism. Some in Labour might well think they can win back seats by beating up on immigrants and tacking to the right: Johnson’s party can do both with far more gusto.Corbynism began with promises of democracy, but ended up as bunkerised as all other Labour leaderships. What started as anti-austerity movement is now a melange of ideas, most of which look and sound utterly absurd on a doorstep on a rainy morning.In the era of taking back control, Corbyn offered yet more direction from Westminster, with utilities run from the centre and hundreds of billions disbursed from remote state institutions. Many of these ideas are interesting, but few of them were properly worked through and none patiently argued for.Giving workers stakes in firms, a green new deal, free broadband: each one came well-intentioned but bedecked in question marks. Any radicalism that fails to ask the really thorny questions isn’t radical at all. In Britain in 2019, those include: against rampant inequality and climate change, what’s the economy for? What do the public actually want from politics and economics?In the 2017 election I wrote that a party that grew out of social institutions needed to turn itself into a social institution in precisely those areas it historically took for granted. That remains the key task: providing advice to those whose benefits are being slashed, legal support to tenants under the cosh from their landlords, haggling with the utilities to provide cheaper and better deals. Add to that: teaching political and economic literacy to voters, not just activists, and consulting constituents on what issues Labour should be battling on.None of this is as easy as getting the woman with the great backstory to run No 11, or some GCSE marketing talk about finding new “narratives”. It’s hard graft, and it won’t make good copy. But Labour has no God-given right to expect votes, let alone to govern. It needs to renew its contract with its base. The big question is whether it wants to."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2bc96d5cab7a1c767c0aa3ef054d7f29a3eb5422/0_60_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=553df09c57a73e78836a9750e67298d7","title":"labour remake itself resurgent communities","story":"Deserted by a broken system, communities are doing things for themselves. This is where the party should find a new homeThe danger now is that people jump to the quick fix, apportion blame and say, “I told you so”. But what was revealed last night, which has been brewing for years, defies anything but the deepest soul-searching about what has gone wrong for Labour. This is existential.So yes, it was partially the leader’s fault and yes, Brexit was a horrendously tough issue for Labour to manage, alongside the cultural split between towns and cities, and the toxic antisemitism that’s infected the party. But it’s much more than any of this.For the crisis is not Labour’s alone. It is a crisis of social democracy that has been gripping the left the world over. So far Labour has bucked the trend, not least because our voting system artificially pumps the party up, as it did in 2005 and 2017. But political gravity cannot be resisted for ever.Labour now joins the ranks of the French socialists, the German SPD, the Dutch social democrats, the Australian Labor party and so many others in or near the departure lounge of politics. And the test here is not “can you be fleetingly in office?”, but “are you a growing and energetic force capable of addressing the climate crisis and big capital are you a force for the transformation that society needs?” Unless we understand what’s happened, and how such a force is now created, then any recovery will be built on sand.Like a leaking pipe, social democracy has been in slow decline for decades. The erosion of class identities, the decline of factory production that produced social solidarity, and then the fall of communism – all pulled the rug from beneath the feet of social democracy. It lost its agency and its method of operation. It lost everything.Next came globalisation, inidualisation and consumerisation. Labour eventually adapted to the terrain in the shape of New Labour, but that sugar rush of repositioning only worked by sowing the deeper seeds of discontent we saw erupt yesterday. Corbynism tried to put a leftwing sheen on a culture of Labourism – the belief that the party has a monopoly of wisdom and therefore knows what is best for the people. Last night that crashed, too.But throughout this decline something amazing has been happening. The failure of the free market and financialisation in 2008, and the obvious limitations of the old bureaucratic state to create a good society, has opened the space for people to do things themselves. They have had no option.In communities, neighbourhoods, different sectors and places, people are combining in new and collaborative ways to fix their own problems. This activity in politics, housing, green energy, caring, lending, learning, fixing and making is being accelerated and aggregated by technology that allows us all to know, talk, connect and organise. Today we live with an inalienable right to participation.So, in this very new context, can Labour come back as it did in 1964 and 1997? In part that begs the question: is there a Harold Wilson, Neil Kinnock or Tony Blair figure who can lead that long march? But the bigger question is, can Labour – a party of technocratic solutions to people’s problems – understand the collaborative sentiment and culture of the 21st century?In many ways what is needed now resonates with Labour’s foundation. The party came from the world around it – of factories, yes, but of a rich cultural and social mix of clubs and friendly societies. If Labour is to renew itself then it must be immersed in the world around it now, the groups and communities springing up across a range of sectors that try to meet people’s needs collaboratively.This is a very different role for Labour. It’s one where it would be in service to people and the rising tide of emerging action – not least on climate.The good society was never going to be created from the top down. It could never be done to us, however well meaning. A genuinely good society can only be created by us, for us. The job of Labour now is to make that happen – or get out of the way and let others do it.Labour had nothing to say during the election campaign about democracy and power: it was all about what it would do for us. This is the big seismic change the party has to make. It must look to the communities it wants to represent and instead think of them as communities to serve. Then it doesn’t matter if you’re in a town or city, voted leave or remain – you know Labour is there to help you and your family. Then power is something Labour would actively share with others and not monopolise. And a new universal agent is created – the networked citizen.There is nothing for Labour to go back to. Instead this is the huge cultural leap Labour must make: nothing else really matters.• Neal Lawson is a director of the centre-left pressure group Compass"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5274da4db1f6e94437b5e212471c168aa5ee8d47/0_148_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8183d6e757a89c3d89a9e3e1333b10c2","title":"tory online election campaign russian bots misinformation retweeting","story":"We didn’t need Russian bots to spread misinformation: real people retweeting false claims did enough damageIt was boomers, not bots, who won it for the Tories. For the whole election campaign we were on the lookout for what the academics call “computational propaganda”, what the platforms call “co-ordinated inauthentic behaviour” and what the media increasingly calls, rightly or wrongly, Russian bots.But every time we found something odd, closer inspection would reveal that the best explanation was the wonderful ersity of human experience, or, more prosaically, older voters whose desire to engage in political activism outweighed their technical literacy.In the last few days of the general election campaign, for instance, we saw accusations of a misinformation campaign aimed at smearing the family of a sick four-year-old by saying they had staged a photo of him lying on a hospital floor. This gave way to the realisation that there was no real campaign, per se just a made-up claim posted to Facebook, shared by thousands who wanted it to be true, and cut-and-pasted on to Twitter by others who didn’t bother to rewrite it in their own words.Real people were behind the Twitter accounts that posted #nevercorbyn every five waking minutes, or that posted suspiciously similar comments underneath Boris Johnson’s Facebook messages, or that seemed to do nothing but retweet Conservative party videos. Because real people are weird.The internet wasn’t the place for smart campaigning. The Labour party put out slick video after slick video, outspent the Tories on Snapchat and Facebook, and handed Jeremy Corbyn’s Twitter account to someone who understands memes extremely well for the entirety of election day. The Conservatives simply sat down and spent six weeks being wilfully stupid, and it worked.In fact, one of the few changes in strategy we saw in the online election was the Conservatives doubling down on simple and stupid. The opening of the campaign was marked by a “shitposting strategy”, with the Tory party sharing low-effort, banally funny campaign messages in the clear hope that they would get as much distribution from opponents as supporters.But, as the election went on, that approach was dropped in favour of a brutally simple one: pick three lines, whether or not they’re true, and just repeat them, for ever, on every platform, without shame or variation. Invent some Labour policies, make up a price-tag for them, and tweet it out as the cost of Labour. Make up a taxation strategy to pay for it, and tweet that out as the party’s tax bombshell. Endlessly, humourlessly, robotically come back to “get Brexit done”. There are lessons here for other political parties, but they aren’t pretty.There are bright spots. For all the attention paid to Facebook adverts, it’s hard to conclude that, at the very least, they matter less than policies and personalities. Over the final days of the election, from 12 November to 11 December, the Liberal Democrats and Labour each spent at least £800,000 on Facebook but the winners, the Conservatives, spent less than £550,000: you can’t buy an election on Facebook just yet. One of the fears of Facebook’s policy on political advertising is that it exports an American view of free speech – where the freedom of unlimited political spending has become a requirement to secure multimillion-dollar war chests before even thinking about a national political career. But in the UK, the total spent on Facebook adverts “about social issues, elections or politics” – everything, from everyone, since October 2018 – is less than £20m.In fact, the most immediate lesson from the Conservative victory has been the opposite: spend on the lower end of the scale, promote simple messages of turnout and fear, and don’t overthink it. If outriders can get a bit of media coverage for breaking the rules, great, but there’s no need to court controversy from the main account.The story may get more complicated as time goes on. Facebook’s abysmal transparency tools, while still better than those offered by any other platform, don’t even reveal basic information such as which constituencies are targeted. Google’s reveal even less: one of the more consequential online spends by the Conservatives could be two days of buying a home-page banner on YouTube, but all the company reveals is that doing so for a day costs “over £50,000” and garners “\u0026gt 10m” impressions.Overall, Google, where the Tories outspend Labour more than two to one, is perhaps the bleakest tale for the digital campaign. All the campaigns spent money on search adverts targeted at their opponents, but the Conservatives went one step further, buying ads to appear when people searched terms such as “Labour manifesto” and “register to postal vote”. I’ve lost count of the number of times we debated whether a given move was “electoral outrage” or simply “sharp tactics”.So what’s the silver lining? That we did this to ourselves. This wasn’t foreign interference, or non-state actors running vast bot networks. In the first week of the campaign, the  reported that the tactics of the Russian state in 2016 had been adopted by politicians themselves: not simply running troll farms, but campaigning through ision and provocation. And that’s what we saw, with fake fact-checkers, invented tax bills, shitposting, search misdirection and more. But what we started, we can stop.

I was born in 1968, a year before the moon landings. It’s hard now to comprehend just how exciting that was for my generation. It really was moon madness. But it was also because of The Clangers, the children’s TV show. I was obsessed with it. They’ve rebooted the series now and it recently celebrated its 50th anniversary. They included a little Maggie model in it. I was about the happiest I’ve ever been!I don’t think I’m especially clever. I was very disillusioned at school. I was put in the remedial class, stuck at the back of the room playing with the safety scissors and the glue. I don’t think my teachers had any expectations for me and I ended up being the class clown, always mucking about and trying to make people laugh.My interest in space saved me because it drew me to science. I was diagnosed with dyslexia after university. I didn’t even hear the word until then and it took a long time for anyone to explain it. At school they just thought I was slow. In lots of ways I think it helps make me who I am, though I absolutely hate doing paperwork. That’s still a nightmare. My brain is wired differently. It’s interesting to note that many people with dyslexia go on to achieve amazing things in adult life they become entrepreneurs or whatever. They just, like me, have a really difficult time at school.My parents were Nigerian immigrants. I was born in the UK, but my heritage is really important to me. I’ve only had the chance to visit the country once. A couple of years ago I was making a radio documentary for the BBC World Service about the African space industry. I always wanted to go there with my father. He often talked of the Nigeria of his youth and it sounded so wonderful. Sadly he passed away 17 years ago, so that opportunity is gone now. I’ve decided I’m going to take my daughter at some point. I’d like her to understand her heritage and where she comes from.I like to think I’ve done work that has made the world better. I’m just trying to do my little bit. As a scientist I’ve had the opportunity to work with some incredible people, especially the work I did on landmine detection and in measuring the rate of climate change. The thing I’m most proud of, though, is the work I’ve done going into schools and trying to get kids interested in science. I’ve spoken to more than 1,500 children in the past 13 years. It’s been thrilling.This generation is amazing. I don’t know whether I inspire them when I talk in schools, but they certainly inspire me. I think my generation were… I don’t want to say apathetic… but it wasn’t like the one before protesting against wars and the like. This one is like that. They’re powered up. They can see the mistakes those before them have made and they want to fix the world. That is why I hope they embrace science. I still believe that in science we can find answers to our problems.I sometimes wonder where the aliens are, but I have little doubt that they’re out there. It’s the numbers game. There are just too many planets, galaxies, solar systems, moons and stars to think there can’t be more life. I think though that there’s a great many variables that would need to happen to result in us making contact. Maybe they came in the age of the dinosaurs and left because they had no one to communicate with. I actually think that aliens arriving would be brilliant for us. Us putting aside our differences and getting our act together to face invading aliens might finally unite humanity.I often wonder if, had the moon landings happened today, there would be the same response. We’re bombarded with CGI. I think when someone walks on Mars it’ll be interesting to see how the public respond to it.

Since 2014 she has been writing about the role of big data and commercial surveillance in the digital era. Last year she published her third book, The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, which became a bestseller and has been described by Zadie Smith as “easily the most important book to be published this century”.This is a powerful compilation of rap music featuring a range of amazing artists: people like Nas, Ghostface Killah, De La Soul. Many of the songs take aim at what I have called “surveillance capitalism” and its power to influence, degrade and control our feelings and behaviours. Many lyrics blaze with insight and the righteous outrage crucial to public awakening. The album names these hidden forces, assuring us that our sense of menace is not paranoia, but recognition of “our generation’s form of nuclear power”. As one rap counsels, “How we deal with this will be the stuff of history.”During a recent week in Paris we were dazzled by many beautiful dinners. But best of all was an afternoon roaming the Jewish Quarter in the Marais, where my son Jake and I collected golden crepes with butter and sugar and massive pittas stuffed with falafel. Sacha Finkelsztajn is a bright yellow-fronted delicatessen, and we laid out our treasures and ordered more: empanadas, pastrami, pastries filled with sweet poppy seed paste. Powered by mugs of hot coffee, we smiled, laughed, and ate joyously for an hour.This extraordinary exhibition of over 200 paintings, drawings and prints follows the journey of Dürer’s life and his otherworldly mastery. You can see his genius building as painstaking studies of hands, fingers, leaves, wings, flowers are reborn in large, complex compositions. There are some revered pieces, like Young Hare, and others rarely on display. The palpable force of his commitment to the world as it is, his uncanny insight and his breathtaking technical skill moved me deeply. The centuries that separate our existences seemed to melt away, leaving only the human struggle that we share.I find it impossible to live without the presence of trees: they focus me on what is most enduring. This Pulitzer-winning novel unfurls from the point of view of trees, creatures that grow stronger with age and die only when attacked from without – just the opposite of humans. Powers’s exquisite and soul-wrenching work is a tragic exploration of the wisdom and generosity of an Earth now doomed by modernity’s perverse refusal to embrace the non-human orders of life upon which everything depends, including now our very survival. This novel left me feeling sanctified, even as each page drove me mad.Earlier this year I saw a revival of this Lanford Wilson play about grief, how it undoes us and remakes us. Adam Driver plays a character whose younger brother is revealed to him only after his sudden death. Driver’s performance was Shakespearean: one of the most extraordinary experiences of theatre I’ve had. It reminded me that a single actor, on stage as in life, can have a transformational effect. Driver gave body and soul with an incandescent ferocity that taught me and changed me – something I didn’t anticipate and will never forget.I am moved by the seriousness with which Berlin memorialises the Holocaust, such as with Track 17 at Grunewald train station, where Jewish families were sent to their murder or the Wall of Mirrors, where ordinary people see only their own reflections. In Schöneberg, panels hang from lampposts displaying the edicts from 1933 onward that deprived Jewish people of their rights.

She painstakingly bred 240 mice in captivity and in 2004 released the elusive mammals on to a coastal nature reserve with plenty of reedbeds for them to hide in.When not a single harvest mouse – Britain’s smallest rodent – was recaptured in subsequent trap surveys, Fail concluded that her efforts to reintroduce them had been unsuccessful.Now, 15 years later, fresh harvest mouse nests have been found for the first time at East Chevington nature reserve, showing that the descendants of Fail’s original harvest mice are in fact thriving.A team of volunteers found two distinctive, orb-shaped nests in dense reedbeds close to where Fail had originally released them. Sophie Webster, of Northumberland Wildlife Trust, who led the search, said: “It was really exciting for everybody. It’s such a big area to search we doubted we would actually find them so it was a real treat.”The nests were woven into grasses a metre (3ft) above ground and contained green leaves showing they were freshly made. Webster is planning a more extensive search of the wider reedbeds, with camera traps and live mammal trapping to see if they can calculate the population.Fail, who now works in outdoor education, was contacted by one of her original team members with the news. “To say I’m ecstatic with this positive result is an understatement,” said Fail. “I’m proud that my work, along with the support of volunteers and experts, has managed to secure the survival of one of Britain’s declining species.”She also emailed her old PhD supervisor. “I told him, ‘This is the email I always wanted to send you’ and he replied, ‘Bloody hell, it worked!’ He was as surprised as I was.”A priority species for conservation and protected by law, the harvest mouse is the weight of 10p piece and is Britain’s only mammal with a prehensile tail, which it uses for grip and balance as it lives in the stalk zone of tall plants.Preyed upon by barn owls, cats and even pheasants, the mouse also suffers in cold, wet weather. Historically, it is more common in southern and eastern England than in the north. It is rarely found north of the Tyne, although recent surveys have discovered it on several sites in County Durham.Fail’s original studies found harvest mice were vulnerable to being predated by wood mice when they were first released and so the 240 captive-bred harvest mice were first released into secure cages to acclimatise.The mice were released incrementally into the wild over the course of eight weeks to avoid saturating the site or endangering all the mice at once.Follow-up survey work using specially adapted traps, which capture small mammals without hurting them, caught plenty of wood mice, shrews and even an angry weasel, but failed to find any trace of harvest mice, despite successfully catching them in trials.Fail said she hoped her phased return methodology could be potentially used to help other reintroduction projects, now it had been shown to be successful.She added: “I’m not saying we’ve changed the world but I hope that what we’ve done gives other people faith and hope that it is possible to conserve a much-loved species with a bit of hard work and dedication.”Mike Pratt, chief executive of Northumberland Wildlife Trust, said: “We’re really pleased and encouraged that in these days when we think we know everything about everything because we’ve got so much data, we can still find something that we didn’t know was there. We know wildlife is suffering terrible declines so this is refreshing to say the least.”Last year, Northumberland also witnessed the return of the pine marten in the wild for the first time in 90 years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96545f22217ecf75ceb2365071b9e42d35791374/0_114_3432_2059/master/3432.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0cc1699e14c0e7800095bbe5f40d2aec","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the best flora and fauna photos from around the world, from an illuminated giraffe to an elusive southern elephant seal"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e3b095cd8ad3f0faa1f3718d0ef23b767a26ed3/0_73_4457_2675/master/4457.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c9263d1fb0becf31e1256fd5a2b1659","title":"observer obituaries 2019 karl lagerfeld remembered by carine roitfeld","story":"10 September 1933 – 19 February 2019The French fashion editor remembers a passionate man of ideas who always remembered the small details• Mary Warnock remembered by Onora O’Neill• Read the Observer’s obituaries of 2019 in fullI remember my first dinner with Karl. I was nervous, knowing I was about to spend one-on-one time with the great Karl Lagerfeld, who was famous for being curious about every subject and incredibly knowledgable. My father, who was originally from Russia, spent a lot of his childhood in Berlin, and I still remember the enchanting voice of German singer Hildegard Knef, a beautiful soundtrack to my childhood. Looking for a suitable subject of conversation with Karl, I asked him if he knew of her, and off he went, telling me many details and anecdotes about this extraordinary woman. The next day, I received drawings, CDs and letters from Karl about Hildegard Knef. That’s how he was: a passionate and attentive man. He was also the only one to always send me flowers on Mother’s Day, with cards like: “You are the proof that one can be both a great stylist and an amazing mother.”Karl was one of a kind. When I left Vogue Paris, he was the first to ask to work with me. I can still hear his voice: “Madame Roitfeld, now that you are free, we must work together.” He was the only one to call me by my last name.Soon he started drawing and painting me, and today I treasure those gifts. The first portrait he took of me in his home marked my life for ever, as he is the one who put my hair in front of my face, creating my “look”.Karl was one of the smartest, most inventive and innovative people I have ever known, so I took his advice to heart. He encouraged me to be original, telling me: “Everything you’re doing, you are to be the first to do.” It was a trait he valued above all else. When I wanted to start my own perfume line, he said: “OK, you want to do a perfume, now be the first one to do it. Be the first editor to make a perfume. You have to surprise people, because people are always bored.” When I was working with him, I had to surprise him – he always wanted something new. For my first issue of CR Fashion Book, the magazine cover had babies and dogs on it – he did not like that cover so much, it was not his thing. However, he still said: “I’m not sure about the picture but you surprised me and that is great.”The greatest compliment he ever gave me was that he thought I “made people better”. I think we made each other better, and in the end, we couldn’t tell who had had which idea any more. Our book The Little Black Jacket, for example: I distinctly remember talking to Karl on the phone on a Sunday afternoon and one of us mentioned this idea, but we were never able to remember who.Karl was my rock. He’s always been there for me, through years of friendship and creation. His sense of humour, words of advice and the precious memories of this time spent together will never leave my thoughts, and this was the same in his personal and private life. Karl had the politeness of a king, though not the punctuality. But whenever he arrived on set, he always looked everyone in the eye and thanked them, including every assistant and crew member.He had impeccable manners and the elegance of never complaining. I am a Virgo and Karl was a Virgo too: we are very faithful people. Virgos inherently feel that everything needs to have a reason behind it, which also explains his strong work ethic.He is always in my thoughts, so present that I still catch myself using the present tense when I talk about him today."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/517fc1e9b07995a1d827c1ea43fbd41ad3df464d/1040_286_5945_3567/master/5945.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cbc4e03a423ad5a3d1787fe86038c57","title":"puffer jackets green credentials","story":"The padded jacket is now as ubiquitous on high streets as cracked pavement slabs and Greggs. Billed as an effective way to stay in your duvet all day, it is, however, less forgiving when it comes to its ethical credentials. Many puffers are made from petroleum-based fabrics and filled with duck and goose down from dubious sources.But alternatives are now appearing. One option for the outer shell is recycled polyester, which is used in jackets by EcoAlf and Katherine Hamnett. New York-based Colovos has made a jacket from water-resistant merino wool, and Gap uses discarded plastic bottles. Moncler last week launched a down jacket made from plant-based fabrics, and Pangaia features a jacket made with dried wildflowers and a biopolymer.North Face and Patagonia prohibit force feeding and live plucking of birds. Recycled down such as Re:Down, as used by Everlane and Arket, consists of “down and feathers extracted from post-consumer goods”.Wilby said that the environmental damage caused by the polyester outer layer of padded jackets was also underestimated by consumers. When the material is washed, it sheds microplastics which are released into the oceans, harming marine wildlife. “Synthetic material presents a huge environmental problem as it will potentially take hundreds of years to degrade,” she said.Recycled polyester is preferable to virgin polyester. But it will still shed microfibres, and Wilby recommends restricting how often you wash your jacket or using a laundry bag to catch microfibres.If the ethical brands succeed, there is a huge market in which they can flourish.

Perfect for hangovers.” It looks like a substantial plateful for £7, perfectly engineered for a surfeit of booze: chicken or beef sausages, eggs, ackee and saltfish, fried dumpling, plantain and beans. “But get here too late in the morning and you’d never find a table,” he says.That’s not a problem these days, not now he’s traded Michael for Stormzy. He may have moved from South Norwood to leafy Kingston in southwest London. He may be the most famous former pupil of Stanley Tech, a man who has played the world’s biggest stages. But he still returns to Bluejay to eat. There’s a table reserved for us, up against a wall plastered with photographs of their regulars, of which he is one. So no, not a standard review. They knew both of us were coming. Instead it’s a snapshot of a particular slice of south London culture the culture which made him.Joy and Dave Blake, both of whose families are Jamaican, opened Bluejay Café in 2008. Places like this are familiar to me I’ve lived a couple of miles up the road in Brixton for almost 30 years, which has its own version, their windows steamed, the air crackling with easy chatter. They’re much more than just restaurants. They are a focus for community a way of reasserting cultural identity, one heaving plateful of the familiar at a time. Rarely do they shout about themselves. They don’t need to because their customers know exactly where they are. They are an extension of the domestic, which means they can be unfairly overlooked and underestimated. The other customers here at Bluejay today are almost entirely black British, though you make assumptions about where their families are from, at your peril.“South London communities are seriously complicated,” Stormzy says. “I’m very Ghanaian, very West African.” At home his mum cooked jollof rice and okra stew and peanut soup. “As a kid I don’t ever remember eating vegetables. It was always big carbs – rice or yam or fufu – and then a stew.” But the Jamaican food here at Bluejay roots him, too. “If you’re African around here you know so much about Jamaican culture, and if you’re Jamaican you know so much about African culture.”He orders us both a fizzing glass of Mighty Malt. It is dark, and batters you around the head with huge caramel flavours. It’s like cola, in knuckle dusters. I admit that, despite three decades living around here, I’ve never before had one. “It’s an acquired taste,” he says. “And, you know, good after a heavy night out.” I leave him in charge of over-ordering. We start with golden fingers of salt fish fritter, both crisp and soft, sliced up into batons to be eaten with our hands.I ask him about food on tour. “Back in the early days,” he says, “it was a shit-show. Come off stage at 11pm and go for a McDonald’s. Get up the next morning and have a fry-up.” Eventually he concluded it was slowing him down for his full-on performance. “During my 2017 tour we had catering. We looked after ourselves.” And then there was the diet he went on ahead of his headline spot at this year’s Glastonbury. “It was 12 weeks, working with a nutritionist and a trainer. A lot of fish. There was mackerel and spinach in the morning, then I’d carb up until 5pm, then just protein and vegetables. It was gruelling. I was hungry all the time.” I ask if that was how he came to be so ripped when he performed with his top off at Glastonbury? He grins. “Yeah, that was it.” I tell him I’m relieved that I thought he was just built like that.Joy starts delivering the food. First up a bowl of glossy oxtail stew, in a deep sauce made rich from the melting gelatine, after many, many hours of heat and care. It is sweet and salty and rich and sustaining on an afternoon with more than a hint of winter about it. You tug at the meat with knife and fork and then set about the bones with your hands. There’s also a bowl of curry goat (never goat curry). It is an earthy yellow, presumably from turmeric, and has a powerful kick of allspice and Scotch bonnet. “Don’t drop that down your shirt,” Stormzy says, as if he’s my mum. “You’ll never get the stain out.” These are the ingredients others might leave behind, pushed firmly to the centre of the stage. Naturally enough there is rice and peas.He also orders a bowl of jerk chicken broken into penne pasta. It feels like a nostalgic act, a reminder of the younger man in search of food to soak up the excesses of the night before. It’s not a subtle bowlful, under its overcoat of waxy melted cheese, but it’s easy to see how it would do the job. I get a single piece of jerk chicken, which comes sauced and properly grilled. Each summer the Lambeth Country Show is held in Brockwell Park just to the south of Brixton. It’s a cross between a classic country show, with flower-arranging tents and sheep shearing demonstrations, and a Caribbean festival. A haze of grill smoke settles across the fields from the many brilliant jerk stands. The jerk chicken here is a reminder of that.To finish we have apple crumble. Would we like custard with that? Yes, we would. What’s the point of crumble without custard? I wonder aloud whether they take credit cards here. Stormzy turns to one of his mates, who arrived with him and is sitting at another table. “Do they?” His friend says no. “But there’s a cashpoint over there,” he says, pointing across the road to the post office. After a full-on night out, they always needed to know where the nearest cashpoint is.Our lunch is done. We’ve run up a bill of £32, but only by over-ordering. Stormzy works his way around the room, leaning his enormously tall frame into eager groups, some of whom he knows, some of whom he doesn’t. Selfies are snapped, friends embraced. Joy takes a kiss on each cheek. And then he’s gone. The car? It’s a Lamborghini SUV, since you asked. Well of course it is.Half Jamaican chef James Cochrane, who has worked at both the Ledbury and Harwood Arms, pulls irreverently on that heritage at his restaurant 1251 in London’s Islington. Try his buttermilk jerk spiced chicken with Scotch bonnet jam or the slow braised kid goat belly with radish and tarragon. Alongside the Caribbean influences, Cochrane playfully works in touches from all over. Hake comes with cod’s roe, XO sauce and nori and a sweetcorn dish is flavoured with miso (1251).The big must-have bakery good this Christmas? It’s the Terry’s Chocolate Orange muffin from Costa, which the coffee shop chain says has been selling at the rate of six a second. Each muffin comes topped with a chocolate orange segment. Apparently, Terry’s was unable to supply inidual segments so the company making the muffins has had to buy in, tap and unwrap tens of thousands of chocolate oranges by hand.Self-described ‘healthy’ fast food chain Leon, is to open two more sites at Motorway services on both the M40 at Beaconsfield and the M25 at Cobham. Meanwhile it has trademarked the phrase ‘Just Happens To Be Vegan’ after the success of its aquafaba based ‘mayonnaise’ supermarket range."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4503f8288fe9eea684f514ea84037538b5d4d387/0_274_2183_1309/master/2183.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2351d7df9da1dd940349644dc780acd","title":"christmas snacks yotam ottolenghi hush puppies crostinis chocolate salami","story":"Whet the appetite with stilton hush puppies, anchovy crostinis and a ‘pre-dessert’ of chocolate salamiYou’ll probably have worked out that the grand feast is essentially a theatrical build-up. Festive drinks are followed by little teasers, a few bites to whet the appetite, but not too much: you need to leave room for the main act. Cheeseboards are, for me, a thing of the past, if only for the fact that I can’t help but go back for more, so now I replace the cheese with just a few rich snacks (you’ll note butter features everywhere this week) to kick-start the party with just the right degree of plenty. This year, I’m making salty anchovy crostinis and the most indulgent hush puppies, and later, because even dessert needs a pre-dessert, a chocolate salami for the final, dramatic close.This is a great little festive snack to hand around at a party, together with your favourite sparkling wine. The butter is quite rich, so two soldiers per person are more than enough.Prep 15 minCook 10 minMakes 12, to serve 67 anchovy fillets, drained and roughly chopped1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped½ green chilli, seeds and pith removed, finely chopped 75g unsalted butter, well-softened to room temperature1 lime – zest finely grated, to get 1½ tsp, and juiced, to get 1 tsp 3 slices sourdough bread, well toasted or grilled Olive oil, for drizzling ½ tbsp parsley leaves, finely chopped, to serveBlack pepperPut the first four ingredients into the small bowl of a food processor with the lime juice and a teaspoon of the zest. Blitz until smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl a few times as you go. Refrigerate if not using straight away you’ll need to bring it back up to room temperature when using.Cut the toast into 12 6cm-long x 2cm-wide soldiers. Spread each soldier with about 10g of the butter mix, drizzle with a little oil and finish with the parsley, the remaining lime zest and some freshly ground black pepper.Hush puppies are tasty bites of fried cornbread batter from the American South. They’re made with everything you’d find in cornbread, but they are fried instead of baked so are wonderfully crisp. The maple butter gives these a sweetsalty edge, but if that’s not your thing, serve them with melted salted butter and hot sauce instead.Prep 10 minCook 25 minMakes 24, to serve 6-8 as a snack170g coarse polenta (not quick-cook) 65g plain flour1 tbsp caster sugar1½ tsp baking powder¼ tsp bicarbonate of soda1 tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed in a mortar½ tsp chilli flakes1 tsp flaked salt 120g plain yoghurt2 large eggs10g fresh coriander leaves, roughly chopped120g stilton, roughly crumbled700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingFor the maple butter80ml maple syrupFlaked salt120g unsalted butter, fridge-cold, cut into 1½cm cubesPut the first eight ingredients in a large bowl and whisk to combine. In a small bowl, whisk the yoghurt, eggs and fresh coriander, then stir into the large bowl with the cheese until just combined. Do not over-mix.Heat the oil in a medium saucepan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, form ping-pong-ball-sized balls of the mixture (each weighing roughly 25g), making about 24 in total. Drop six or seven balls one by one into the hot oil, and fry for two to three minutes, or until golden all over and cooked through. Transfer to a tray lined with kitchen paper and keep warm while you cook the remaining two or three batches (turn down the heat a little if they brown too quickly). While you’re frying the hush puppies, make the maple butter. Put the maple syrup and a pinch of flaked salt in a small saucepan on medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and add a quarter of the cold butter cubes. Whisk to incorporate, then repeat until all the butter is used up. Don’t let the sauce boil at all, or it’s likely to split. Set aside until ready to serve.Serve the hush puppies warm with the butter alongside, for dipping.This chocolate salami won’t stick around for long – one bite leads to another, and the rest is history.

Add the first five ingredients and cook, stirring every now and then, until melted and combined. Remove from the heat and stir in the milk and coffee until smooth. Fold in the biscuits and nuts, then transfer to the fridge for 25 minutes, until cooled but not set.Get ready a large sheet of greaseproof paper, and spoon the cooled chocolate mix on to it. Use the paper to help you roll out the chocolate into a 30cm-long x 6cm-wide log or salami shape. Twist the ends of the paper to enclose the chocolate mix, then put on a tray and refrigerate until set – about five hours. Remove from the fridge a few times during that period, and roll the salami again in its paper wrapping, so it keeps its rounded shape.Sift half the icing sugar on to a large piece of greaseproof paper, then unwrap the log directly on to it. Sift the remaining sugar on top of the salami, then use your hands to rub the icing sugar all over the sides.

Although he always had his eyes on a high ball, his elbow into the face of the Burnley captain, Ben Mee, drew the game’s second caution from Robinson.Jack Cork should then have sealed the points in the 67th minute but, after stealing the ball off Sean Longstaff deep in Newcastle’s half and shrugging aside a challenge from Fernández, his 10-yard shot was superbly saved by Dubravka.Following a 20-yard volley by Joelinton that caught the sidenetting, Wood then angled a left-wing McNeil cross into the near post but it went narrowly over the bar.Eight minutes from time Newcastle almost stole an equaliser, only for the substitute Dwight Gayle to sidefoot wide from inside the six-yard area following a low Joelinton cross from the left after he had contentiously barged Erik Pieters off the ball."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7eb31b56b4534c944ea56db555a12c0427e94654/0_158_2300_1379/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=743b0f9182b4decab2fd32addcc0835e","title":"chelsea bournemouth premier league match report","story":"First the delay, then the wild, disbelieving celebrations. As the wait went on Bournemouth began to sense the VAR check was going to fall in their favour. Dan Gosling, opportunistic and alert when his chance arrived, had a feeling the linesman was wrong to flag him offside. The midfielder ran towards the big screen signalling that his goal was being reviewed and before long he was being mobbed by his jubilant teammates, who had played with spirit and togetherness and implemented Eddie Howe’s gameplan perfectly.While Howe beamed on the touchline, Frank Lampard watched on helplessly. No wonder Chelsea’s manager has signalled his readiness to bring in greater quality up front. This uninspired, disjointed performance from Lampard’s attackers will convince him of the need to address his inconsistent team’s creativity deficit during the January transfer window. Chelsea, who are making a habit of losing to sides in need of a jolt, were out of ideas long before the final whistle and could have no complaints about a fourth defeat in five league games.Bournemouth, who had arrived here on the back of a five-match losing run, rose four points above the bottom three with their first win since 2 November.They were impressive for a team supposedly on the slide. Ryan Fraser was a scurrying presence on the left, running at César Azpilicueta and testing Kepa Arrizabalaga’s reflexes with a low drive in the third minute, and they were robust and disciplined in midfield, with Jefferson Lerma screening fastidiously in front of a makeshift back four.The visitors worked hard to stifle Chelsea’s flow, shutting off the supply lines to Mason Mount in the No 10 position, and their organisation ensured the first half was a forgettable affair, low on chances and entertainment.Chelsea looked fatigued after reaching the last 16 of the Champions League during the week. There were too many careless touches, too many crossed wires in the final third, and their lack of creativity made life easy for Bournemouth’s deep-lying defence.There were a few flickers of promise. After eight minutes Jorginho swept a lovely pass through to Mount, whose dinked effort was saved by Aaron Ramsdale, and Tammy Abraham swept an early chance wide at the near post.Yet there was a sterile feel to their territorial dominance. Willian’s deliveries from the right lacked accuracy, Christian Pulisic never shook off Jack Stacey, Bournemouth’s diligent young right-back, and an increasingly irritable Lampard could have been forgiven if he was dreaming about dipping into his £150m budget to bring in electrifying talents such as Jadon Sancho, Timo Werner or, more likely if Chelsea act in January, Crystal Palace’s Wilfried Zaha.It should have not been such a slog. Bournemouth’s defence was shorn of Steve Cook and the hamstrung Nathan Aké, a £40m target for Chelsea, but Simon Francis and Chris Mepham shackled Abraham. Howe’s side were gaining belief, even though the absence of Callum Wilson lessened their edge up front.A soporific first half fitted the pattern of Chelsea’s home games this season. They have struggled to seize the initiative at home and Bournemouth sensed an opportunity to cause an upset. They threatened when Joshua King burst clear at the start of the second half, only for Kurt Zouma to race back and close down the striker’s shot.Nothing was working for Chelsea, whose fans chuntered when Antonio Rüdiger ked a crossfield pass out for a throw. Willian’s corners kept hitting the first man and Bournemouth continued to look lively on the break, with Zouma forced to come to the rescue when King ran through again. All that was missing from King’s performance was a touch of composure, typified by the moment when he failed to give Gosling a tap-in.Chelsea hinted at upping the tempo just before the hour. Pulisic, collecting a loose ball and driving at Bournemouth, had a shot deflected wide and Zouma also went close after a scramble from a corner. Yet it did not last and Lampard altered his approach in the 65th minute, replacing Pulisic and Willian with Mateo Kovacic and Callum Hudson-Odoi, changes which led to Mount being moved to the left wing.Chelsea continued to toil, even though they were denied when Ramsdale repelled Emerson Palmieri’s header. It would have been undeserved and Bournemouth snatched the points when Gosling, onside by a yard, collected a header back into the area, turned and hooked the ball over Arrizabalaga. Azpilicueta’s effort to clear off the line was in vain and Bournemouth had triumphed here for the third time in five visits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/278751e2f9cb678a2f4b26522ec798fb5ee5f045/0_84_3112_1868/master/3112.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56b4056fd405cdb91e90ee79076a6ff2","title":"leicester city norwich city premier league match report","story":"Leicester’s second “mission impossible” suddenly looks all the more fiendish. Their winning run, amounting to eight league games before this afternoon, had been expected to continue in relative comfort against a relegation-threatened Norwich, but they did not deserve anything more than the draw for which they had to settle. Jamie Vardy was not even able to augment his own eight-match scoring run, his 38th-minute header effort deflecting in off Tim Krul for Leicester’s equaliser and going down as an own goal. It bailed the home side out after Teemu Pukki had scored for their enterprising visitors, who played well throughout, but Leicester’s inability to find a winner leaves them 10 points shy of Liverpool and almost certainly shorn of hope that a title challenge can be sustained.Despite the difference in league positions this clash had an agreeable feel to it at the outset. Neither Brendan Rodgers nor Daniel Farke sanction much deviation from their commitment to an open, high-intensity style and it was, on paper, one of those fixtures that stood little chance of finishing goalless.That prediction was borne out soon enough but the real surprise was that Pukki’s opener had seemed perfectly likely on the balance of play. Norwich were never going to respect the form book with a containing game and, after a tentative start, could have scored twice before eventually getting it right.Alex Tettey had the first go, drilling a half-cleared corner towards goal and watching Ben Chilwell block with Kasper Schmeichel almost certainly beaten. Their second sight of goal was clearer and stemmed from a superb move, Max Aarons and Kenny McLean slicing Leicester open before the former centred for the stretching Pukki. From a matter of feet, and with Schmeichel nowhere near, he managed to graze the ball but not sufficiently to ert it in.By the time Pukki did score, in the 26th minute, Norwich were looking much the more composed side in possession. But Rodgers will have been perplexed by the way in which a relatively simple pass from Tom Trybull bisected Leicester entire midfield, giving Emi Buendía all the space he needed in front of the back four. His slide-rule ball for Pukki was a peach, though, weighted just well enough to meet the striker’s run past Caglar Soyuncu. The finish, rolled across a rooted Schmeichel, was outstanding.Leicester had largely spluttered by this point although, in between those first two Norwich chances, a snaking run by Youri Tielemans had brought a 20-yard shot that Krul fumbled on to the base of a post. They looked flat and perhaps needed the sharpener of a major flashpoint shortly after the half-hour. Norwich felt entitled to receive the ball back when Tom Trybull, aware Buendía was down, knocked it out for a Leicester throw-in. But Iheanacho, failing to get the memo upon receiving possession, surged towards the penalty area and was only halted by a Christoph Zimmermann’s crude foul.Now that the danger had passed half of Norwich’s players piled in furiously on Iheanacho. The melee that ensued took some resolving, with VAR eventually being deployed to adjudge Todd Cantwell, who had bent down menacingly towards his prone opponent and appeared to grab at him, did not deserve a red card.Norwich had not needed the interruption and fell asleep soon afterwards in the manner that has undone much of their good work all season. James Maddison’s corner and Vardy’s run across Kenny McLean to the near post were meat-and-drink stuff but still too much for the away defence. Vardy made contact but his header would have flashed across goal had it not glanced in off the hand of an unlucky Krul.Whether due to an iffy performance or a residual red mist Iheanacho was replaced by Demarai Gray straight afterwards. At half-time Rodgers, clearly dissatisfied, made a second change in deploying Harvey Barnes for the ineffective Dennis Praet.He almost received an instant response. Three minutes of the second period had passed when Vardy, taking a long Maddison pass down beautifully, skated around Krul at a wide angle on the left but rolled his effort against the outside of the near upright. Then Vardy drew a save with a sidefooter from Chilwell’s cross and Leicester, while still short of their best, were at least asking questions.It remained a good, competitive game, though, with Norwich retaining a threat and showing an appetite to engage in meaty challenges. One of them came from Aarons, sliding in to block from Vardy. Krul saved again after Vardy had juggled into a shooting position but, going into the final 15 minutes, Leicester were hardly battering the door down.Barnes summed up a more general waywardness by air-kicking an attempted volley near the 18-yard line. Leicester then had to thank Soyuncu, this time keeping up with Pukki after another sumptuous ball from Buendía had sent him scampering away, for intervening as Norwich sensed they stood just as much chance of a winner as their hosts.Pukki was denied again, this time by Ricardo Pereira after Ben Godfrey had released him, and Aarons almost skewed into his own net during a frantic finale. At then end the only cheers came from the away support."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95e324e8f628aa92df7efc2b57a359881832a05c/0_13_1381_829/master/1381.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05f4e4bd0eb41f23227c10271e7ca8fc","title":"liverpool watford premier league match report","story":"Liverpool will head for the Club World Cup in Qatar on Sunday comfortable in the knowledge their commanding lead in the Premier League will not be troubled any time soon. This was far from a vintage display by Jürgen Klopp’s team, in fact they were fairly average and flattered by the scoreline, but a remarkable 26th win from their past 27 league games was the hallmark of would-be champions in its own way.Mohamed Salah struck twice to down a determined Watford side who, with more conviction and quality in front of goal, could have given Nigel Pearson something more tangible than a positive performance on his first game as the club’s new manager.Liverpool never got into their stride, which was perfectly understandable after an exhaustive effort at Salzburg in the Champions League in midweek, but they produced the flashes of quality to turn a difficult afternoon into another victorious one.The first half had been a non-event for Liverpool, to the growing irritation of the home crowd, and encouraging for Pearson’s efforts to instil organisation and belief in Watford when one moment demonstrated the chasm between the top and bottom of the Premier League. It was not one Abdoulaye Doucouré will recall fondly. The Watford midfielder should have put the visitors ahead when he was presented with a gilt-edged chance in front of the Kop goal. Seconds later, having made a complete mess of the opportunity, Doucouré was presented with a clear view of how it should be done as Salah immaculately swept Liverpool ahead.Watford escaped several times in the first half behind James Milner, Andy Robertson’s replacement at left-back, with Troy Deeney close to converting Ismaïla Sarr’s inviting low cross in the opening minutes. The striker just failed to connect in front of Alisson’s goal. Sarr was involved again when he released Étienne Capoue into space on the right. From the byline, the midfielder rolled the ball back for the unmarked Doucouré to convert but he scuffed the shot horribly and Joe Gomez prevented Gerard Deulofeu pouncing on the loose ball. From the resulting, and wrongly-awarded corner, Liverpool made Doucouré pay with a lightning counter.Roberto Firmino released Sadio Mané with an overhead kick. The Senegal international sent Salah racing through but with plenty to do as Kiko Femenía came across to cover. That was the full-back’s intention at least. With a flick of the instep Salah cut inside, leaving Femenía flailing, and curled a delightful finish from the edge of the area around Ben Foster and inside the far post. It was Salah’s seventh goal in five appearances against Watford for Liverpool.Until that point the leaders had been frustrated by Watford’s resilient defending, Foster slowing the game down by taking an age over every goal kick and an unusual lack of cohesion among their forward line. And Liverpool escaped a second time when Sarr became the latest Watford player to lose all composure with only Alisson to beat. The £25m summer signing looked certain to equalise when Deulofeu broke down the right and Liverpool’s goalkeeper tipped his low centre into the path of Sarr. The Senegal winger, no more than eight yards out and completely unmarked, sliced the shot skywards with his shin. Doucouré, somewhat inevitably, scooped the loose ball over.Sarr forced Alisson into a decent save early in the second half but Liverpool thought they had doubled their advantage when Mané steered a superb header beyond Foster from Xherdan Shaqiri’s delightful cross. The celebrations had died down and Watford were about to restart in the centre circle when VAR made its belated intervention. Mané, VAR spotted following a lengthy review, was a fraction ahead of Craig Cathcart when Shaqiri delivered from the left. No goal.Deulofeu almost capitalised on the reprieve when released in behind Trent Alexander-Arnold by Doucouré. Alisson rushed off his line to deny the former Everton winger with a crucial save but Liverpool continued to live dangerously. Heavy first touches from both Salah and Firmino allowed Foster to gather when the Liverpool forwards were clean through on goal. At the other end Sarr appealed in vain for a penalty after a nudge in the back from Virgil van Dijk as he raced into the area. Van Dijk almost put through his own net when he steered a wayward pass from the substitute Andre Gray wide of Alisson but also just wide of the goal. Deulofeu struck the outside of the near post with the resulting corner, Sarr volleyed another decent chance wide from the edge of the area and Watford unnerved Anfield with several dangerous free-kicks in the closing stages.But Liverpool got the job done yet again. In the 89th minute Mané broke down the right and centred for Divock Origi. The Liverpool substitute scuffed his free shot at Foster’s goal but Salah converted an improvised back-heel that was allowed to stand following another lengthy VAR review. The leaders march on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/52892c333eb40e2f55dfacc10ef601b71f060cc1/464_62_1952_1171/master/1952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3aec6bf04cef2b0c6bf3910b51235ea4","title":"leicester city v norwich city chelsea v bournemouth clockwatch live","story":"Dan Gosling scored the winner as Chelsea’s recent slump continued while Norwich stopped Leicester’s hot streak in its tracksA good win for Burnley and a poor show from Newcastle. A home loss, not too good from us, which has been the story of us this season a similar story to that which has been happening recently. They were very organised and we had to make it more difficult for them but we didn’t. We had a really good patch and now we have lost three of four games and you say, “woah, that’s reality, lads”. Jacob Steinberg was at Stamford Bridge to see a shock victory for Bournemouth.I have got a number of players that can come and play. We started with the same eleven from last week that played very well. I needed to make a change and we played with two wingers the second half and we couldn’t quite make the final breakthrough. #Lampardout seems to be trending on Twitter which seems harsh to say the very least. After all, he is Frank Lampard. Paul Doyle was at Bramall Lane to see Blades beat Villa 2-0.Here’s Nick Ames’ report on Leicester 1-1 Norwich.League Two scores and standings. League One scores and standings.Championship scores and standings.Here’s some Jürgen Klopp press conference action from before. Liverpool have had another good day. Euro news: Barcelona could only draw 2-2 with Real Sociedad, and Bayern Munich won 6-1 defeat of Werder Bremen with a Philippe Coutinho hat-trick. Robert Lewandowski got two. Should Manchester United beat Everton tomorrow then they will be just two points behind Frank Lampard’s Chelsea. It’s a funny old game. Two John Fleck goals, and a Jack Grealish penalty miss. That’s a fine day for the Blades and Villa are in real danger of the drop they could really, really do with a goalscorer. Macclesfield Town’s austerity XI drew 1-1 at Walsall, if you were wondering. I certainly was. It’s all over and that’s probably that for Leicester’s title challenge. They could not find a winner and Jamie Vardy could not find his goal. Liverpool ten points clear at the top. It finished Leeds 3-3 Cardiff, which is something of a choke from Marcelo Bielsa’s team. As predicted, it wasn’t a classic and the goal came via a mistake. Sean Dyche’s team continue their trend of beating teams around them. Chelsea’s slide continues on another day when the Frank Lampard revolution stalled. Looks like spending in January definitely needs to happen. The winning goal was very odd indeed, but Bournemouth deserved their win, having defended so well. Leicester had three minutes of time added on to find a winner and to stop Jamie Vardy’s scoring run in its tracks. Newcastle have been poor today, it seems. Burnley’s three-game losing streak is at its end, with Nick Pope not having to get through much work at Turf Moor.Chelsea pushing on with Kovacic having a shot saved by Aaron Ramsdale. Oh Leeds! Cardiff have scored their third. Robert Glatzel has got it and West Brom will finish the day top of the Championship. Is this where the Leeds choke begins once more? Chelsea have five minutes of time added on to chase their equaliser. They seem imbalanced by having so many forwards on the pitch. Cardiff’s surge may be at an end as goalscorer Sean Morrison has been sent off. It seemed harsh, perhaps an orange card. Relief for Leeds, and they needed it. Chelsea’s wobble has continued, and they’ve been poor today against an opponent who had lost their last six matches. That Gosling goal was chaotic, and with defending not dissimilar to the chaos for Everton’s first goal last week. And Leeds have an edgy last eight minutes to play as Sean Morrison has scored for Cardiff. It’s 3-2. Controversy at Stamford Bridge. Has the ball crossed the line? There is a VAR check to see if anyone was offside. They were not. Oh dear, Frank. Chelsea are now piling forward, with Batshuayi on as a sub to make it two strikers on the field. Bournemouth are sat deep and in numbers. There seems to be a VAR for a retake of that Grealish penalty but it stands as a miss for the bleach-haired musketeer of the Midlands. Dean Henderson is sent the wrong way but Jack Grealish has hit the bar!Handball shout at Bramall Lane, as the ball hits Blades’ John Egan. The referee missed it and VAR has intervened. It takes an age to come up with the decision. And the penalty is given. Swansea are 3-1 up on Middlesbrough now, and Macclesfield have conceded to Walsall. It’s 1-1. Dominic Solanke is on as a sub for Bournemouth against his old club Chelsea, and the away team are continuing to create chances. David McGoldrick is the silky link man, a one-two and Fleck scores his fourth goal in four matches. Middlesbrough pay the price for being down to ten men as Andre Ayew scores his second, and puts Swansea 2-1 up. Leicester miss a golden chance to lead through Wilfred Ndidi. By the way, Barcelona are locked at 2-2 with Real Sociedad. Luis Suarez put Barca 2-1 up but then came an equaliser from Alexander Isak. Leeds have conceded a goal to Cardiff, it’s 3-1 now after Lee Tomlin scored. Bournemouth go close, the ball spilling to Lewis Cook and Chelsea had to scrabble to get the ball clear.Middlesbrough, having pulled level, are down to ten men, as Marcus Browne has been dismissed. Andy Carroll might have been sent off, having forearm-smashed Ben Mee. He only got a yellow but got a bit lucky.

Liverpool move 11 points clear with an uncomfortable victory over Watford in a very strange game. Mo Salah, who played up front in a 4-2-3-1 system, scored two classy goals to punish Watford for a number of missed chances. Liverpool were sloppy, nervous, unconvincing ... and they still won.The goal itself was a beauty. Liverpool split Watford open with two fine passes from Alexander-Arnold and then Oxlade-Chamberlain, who slid the ball down the inside-right channel to release Mane. He cut it back carefully to Origi, who made a hopeless mess of his first-time shot. It was bobbling wide of goal when Salah improvised to flick the ball behind his standing leg and into the net. It looked like it was going to be disallowed for offside, but eventually the VAR folk decided his heel was level with Kabasele’s.GOAL GIVEN!

Liverpool bring on Origi for Firmino Watford introduce Quina for Doucoure.87 min Alexander-Arnold wastes 20 seconds before taking a Liverpool corner. This time there are no boos.86 min “The pessimism is a result of the gap since the last league title,” says Niall Mullen. “Like England fans didn’t really believe they’d won the Ashes in 2005 until the umpires came out \u0026amp knocked the bails off at the Oval. Just like the England fans thought that somehow Shane Warne could come out in the gloaming and win it for the Aussies so Liverpool fans imagine that the lovechild of Federico Macheda \u0026amp Demba Ba will inevitably thwart us.”Ah yeah, I get that, but I still think it applies to most teams. For example, I remember being unsure when Man Utd were 14 points clear in 1993-94. And I was bloody right to be pessimistic, because Blackburn almost reeled them in. 85 min This is one of the oddest games of 2019. 84 min Alexander-Arnold’s imaginative through pass to Mane is just intercepted by the sliding Kabasele. He has had a blinder. At the other end, Doucoure shots high over the bar from inside the D. Watford deserve at least a point in this game. At this rate, Liverpool could drop to fifth in the xG table by tomorrow night.83 min Sarr belts a volley well wide from inside the D.82 min “Hi Rob,” says Mike MacKenzie. “I can stop this festive goodwill ... the refereeing sucks big time! Not just this match but in most of them. Way too many fouls missed and bad calls on out of bounds. I know it’s not easy but too many obvious calls aren’t made.”Each his own and all, but I think they do a pretty amazing job in the circumstances, especially as it has become so much harder since the advent of social media and VAR.81 min The resulting corner from Deulofeu hits the outside of the near post! Alisson was scrambling across his line, and I’m not certain he had it covered. Liverpool have been so sloppy today.80 min Van Dijk almost scores an own goal!

Watford have had so many opportunities in attack today.76 min Oxlade-Chamberlain’s excellent cross is nutted over his own bar by Mariappa. Watford have defended admirably today.75 min Andre Gray replaces Troy Deeney, who looks shattered.74 min Robertson plays a slick one-two with Mane and picks out Firmino with an immaculate low cross. He takes too long to get his shot away, and it hits Hughes before dribbling through to Foster.73 min This has been a peculiar game.

Jurgen Klopp is baring his teeth at allcomers, because he wanted play brought back for an earlier foul on Salah.63 min Salah, put through by Milner, dithers and is eased off the ball by Kabasele. He wants a penalty but, as with the Sarr appeal at the other end, there was nothing in it. Moments later, Salah drives miles wide with his right foot.62 min Firmino’s sharp low drive from the left side of the box is well held by the plunging Foster. Mane and Salah were waiting for a rebound.60 min Sarr surges past van Dijk in the area and falls over. It will be checked but it’s not a penalty. Van Dijk did lean into him, but not with enough force for it to be a foul.60 min It looks like Wijnaldum’s knee rather than his hamstring. He’s leaving the field a little gingerly, to be replaced by Andy Robertson. That means James Milner will go into midfield.59 min “Hey Rob,” says Kristof Künssler-McIlwain. “Has it ever happened that a couple actually found each other over MBM?

It’s been a strange game.54 min: Fine save! Alisson makes an excellent block to deny Deulofeu, who was through one on one. Deulofeu appealed for a shove from behind by Alexander-Arnold, but there was nothing in it. He hit the shot well but it was too close to Alisson, who is brilliant in one-on-one situations. He reminds me a little of Peter Schmeichel in the way his presence unsettles attackers as they run through on goal.Mane was a millimetre offside. Shame as it was a lovely goal - a fierce cross from Shaqiri on the left, and an emphatic flicked header from Mane at the near post.VAR check Mane may be offside here.The best attacker in the world scores another superb goal.48 min Another chance for Watford! Sarr plays a one-two with Doucoure and slides a close-range shot from a tight angle that is smothered by Alisson.

It’s another shocking miskick. Deulofeu skinned Alexander-Arnold on the left of the area and fizzed a low cross-shot into the six-yard box. The ing Alisson pushed it out as far as Sarr, eight yards from goal, and he shanked the bouncing ball so badly that it flew off the side of his boot at a 90-degree angle.40 min You see what happens, Nigel? You see what happens if you win a corner against this Liverpool side?Watford won a corner after that Doucoure chance, and 15 seconds later they were behind. The corner was half cleared towards Firmino, who improvised superbly to volley the loose ball over his head to Mane. He moved it down the inside-left channel to Salah, who Cruyff-turned away from Kiko Femenia on the edge of the area and toed a right-footed curler that drifted into the far corner. Brilliant goal.37 min: Great chance for Watford! They should be ahead. Sarr played a nice pass into space for Capoue down the right. He moved into the area and carefully picked out Doucoure, who miskicked completely in front of goal. 35 min Firmino twists Kabasele inside out to win a corner. Nothing comes of it. This has been a dog of a game so far, devised and hosted by Nigel Pearson. He’ll be thrilled with how Watford have played."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4fbd13541342a3765ca5ef40d64670f1a443376/0_181_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1508c7b386c4fcb17c42431271b2ec17","title":"southampton v west ham premier league live","story":"3 min “Hey Rob,” says JR in Illinois. “I’m not really intending to insult anyone but this game wouldn’t be referred to by anyone as a ‘glamour tie’, would it?

Thankfully, as many health experts – and a 2017 “Love Potatoes” campaign from the Agriculture and Horticulture Development Board – have pointed out, this staple of British cuisine is low in fat, high in fibre and a great source of energy. Bonus points if you eat the vitamin-packed skin.But making an effort not to bin the peel isn’t going to solve the problem of food waste alone. The potato has long been a contributor to the more than £1bn of produce thrown away every year before it even reaches a supermarket.“Potato growing is not precision agriculture. You’re much more at the whim of Mother Nature than with some other vegetables. From year to year, exactly what’s coming at us has quite a lot of variation to it,” explains James Truscott, managing director of Branston.Branston is nearing its 30th anniversary with Tesco, for whom it processes over a third of a million tonnes of potatoes annually. That’s a lot of spuds.To ensure supermarket success, the produce must meet the expectations of customers – some of whom are swayed by appearance. While food-waste-reducing efforts such as “wonky veg bags”, including Tesco’s Perfectly Imperfect range, have emerged in recent years, Truscott points out that we need to be realistic about what sells.“There is an increasing number of consumers who have food waste much higher up their priority list than they might have done a few years ago, which is great. And things like “wonky veg” have real resonance for some customers. But the reality is, great-looking produce sells better.”However, oversized or undersized potatoes are attractive to ready meal manufacturers, something Tesco recognised five years ago when it was trying to find ways to reduce food waste across its business – part of its commitment that no food fit to eat should go to waste across its entire UK operations.Branston, in turn, was able to invest in state-of-the-art peelers that can cope with the wonky veg.“We now take a really big proportion of those secondary potatoes, peel them and then send them off to Samworths to become the mash on the top of a cottage pie,” says Truscott. “Finding other routes to market for the crop is key. We can offer a product customers want and still find a really good added-value home for the rest of it.”Branston sends 350 tonnes of product a week to Samworths from its potato-peeling unit, which means that ready meal we grab when we’re too tired to cook may be more sustainable than we think.But that’s not all. Keen to further stamp out food waste, Branston and Tesco are embracing state-of-the-art technology, an investment that has been helped by a five-year contract to supply Tesco with most of its fresh potatoes. Introducing the “digital potato”, which predicts how likely the crop is to get damaged during harvesting, washing and sorting.“It looks like a potato, but it’s bright orange and blue,” says Truscott. “It’s basically got a load of sensors in it. You plant it in the field, and then harvest it and see how much damage happens on the harvester. You can put it through washes and graders on the production lines too to see if there are particular points of impact, so that we can address those with a smarter design.”And just when you thought the potato couldn’t get more high-tech, Truscott reveals that the company has launched a new system that started life as a 3D camera from an Xbox.“We will mount it on harvesters and it will count and size all of the potatoes on the harvest bed, so we know exactly what’s coming at us,” he explains.“Right now, growers go into a potato field with a fork, dig up a few potato plants and measure them. It’s a method that’s been used for centuries, but it’s a tiny snapshot and statistically not a very good view as to what’s coming.”The camera will enable growers to see the size profile and expected yield of crop for every field. This information will hopefully generate fewer potatoes that would have otherwise gone to waste.“We’re really excited about technology, because it’ll help growers get better at what they do in the field, and therefore be more sustainable,” says Truscott. “But it’ll also allow us to plan really, really well.”Tesco’s long-term partnerships with its suppliers means they can then invest in new technology, such as Branston’s major investment in handling and packing tech, and work together to cut food waste.Giving potatoes a new lease of life is not the only way that Tesco is working with its suppliers to reduce the impact producing food has on the environment. Tesco and WWF are working together to halve the environmental impact of the average UK shopping basket, partnering with suppliers to drive innovation and tackle sustainability challenges across their supply chains, starting with some of the most popular products in the modern basket, like potatoes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ac848d224c9fb92853df841e80551ad4d7156e4/0_55_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd665bce9a0c3e342df6a089a1e181f","title":"we feed 2000 children turning surplus food into free school meals in kenya","story":"One international grower has found an ingenious way to use up surplus produce – while also benefiting its local communitySome pupils at Maua school in Naivasha, Kenya, were so hungry that they’d skip school to search the bushes for wild fruit. Others who didn’t cut class would steal from nearby shops so they’d have something to eat for lunch.Headteacher Rosalin Wafula was growing concerned with the high levels of truancy and signs of poor concentration in the 850 students she looks after.“Some children had food some did not. In a school, we should have equality. But many would feel out of place because they didn’t have anything to eat,” she says.But thanks to a new scheme that turns surplus food from local packhouses into free meals for children, Wafula has seen a big improvement in attendance and classroom participation.Stevenage-based Flamingo Produce has been supplying vegetables such as green beans, baby corn and broccoli from Kenya to Tesco in the UK since 1994, and was looking for ways to reduce food waste and benefit the community at the same time.“In Kenya, we end up with a lot of green beans that are too curly. In the UK, you may have the opportunity to sell them as part of Tesco’s ‘perfectly imperfect’ veg range. But we’re 6,000 miles away and flying such a product is not environmentally, or economically, very wise,” managing director Ian Michell explains.Flamingo had already taken small steps to tackle food waste, such as no longer trimming green beans before they are transported and sold. But Michell knew more could be done.Working with Tesco, he came up with the idea of setting up kitchens in the Kenya packhouse to make soup from the leftover vegetables to give to children at lunchtime. The scheme is based on the supermarket’s Community Food Connection programme in the UK, where leftover food from stores is donated to local charities. To date, Tesco has donated more than 150m meals from surplus food to local charities worldwide.“We’re now feeding 2,000 children a day,” Michell says.It wasn’t as simple as it sounds, though, recalls HR manager Tabitha Ngaywa. Soup isn’t a particularly common meal in Kenya. She was worried the kids wouldn’t actually want to eat it. Luckily, Flamingo Produce’s canteen manager was able to work with pupils and their parents to create a hot meal that the community could enjoy.“We don’t really appreciate soup in Kenya. So when the idea came to us it was a little bit difficult for us to imagine how it would be done,” Ngaywa reveals.Parents, pupils and teachers were brought on board to test the dish. Once feedback was positive, Flamingo Produce went ahead with the pilot in March, recruiting extra staff to help prepare and transport the meals.According to Wafula, Ngaywa needn’t have worried – children often ask for second helpings. She’s seen a great improvement in the quality of their work and attitude in the classroom, too.“Some of these children might not have had dinner the night before, or a proper breakfast in the morning. Their concentration was very low. But now they are very eager to learn. They are able to stay in class and participate. So they love it.”The scheme is in place across two schools in Naivasha now, and Flamingo Produce plans to roll it out to the company’s packhouses in Peru, Guatemala and Morocco soon.“Tesco’s help and funding will allow us to scale this into different regions all over the world. My target is 2m school meals in the year 2020,” says Michell. “We also hope to take a lot more of our products and make them into nutritious meals with long shelf lives. This will help us transport the product anywhere in the world to low-income families.”As Wafula points out, the promise of a free, nutritious meal each day can have a positive impact on mental wellbeing.“Every child should have that sense of belonging. And now, everyone feels equal because they all have something to eat.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0840031073cca38b853f03a4b4c1099f850b73e/0_17_1845_1107/master/1845.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4d6986f2edd83bf57868f822fb2a73e","title":"stormzy heavy is the head review hyper confident return","story":"This powerful follow-up to Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer is a grandstanding, soul-searching bid to crack the US – without losing that pugnacious south London voice“How’s the best spitter in grime so commercial?” wonders Stormzy on Wiley Flow, a standout track off his second studio album, Heavy Is the Head. It is a pointed rhetorical flourish from a man who mostly wears the mantle of street poet-king like a tracksuit made of fine silk.It was, arguably, only a matter of time before grime threw up its true crossover star. That the genre should have found one as analytical, mould-breaking and assured as Stormzy is a particular thrill. His second album continues seamlessly on from 2017’s landmark No 1 Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer. If anything, Heavy Is the Head grandstands harder, sings more sweetly and examines the rapper’s own conscience even more attentively than before.First and foremost, this is a hyper-confident return – top-heavy on front, stats and burns. Joining Wiley Flow and Vossi Bop – two of four strong pre-album tracks – are just shy of half a dozen more cocky tracks, all of which re-establish Stormzy’s verbal pre-eminence with panache. Rather than building a career purely from party rap, songs for “the ladies” or postcode beef, Stormzy has risen largely through the old-school medium of witty bragging – a combination of menace and humour that remains on point here. He does a fine line in pique, his brow furrowed in aggrieved disbelief. “Ah man, the audacity!” he actually growls on the standout Audacity, taking on unnamed pretenders (“ashy youths”) and false friends (“wolves in sheepskin”).Performance statistics abound on Stormzy’s battle raps, as he tots up venue capacities around the country, or boasts about chart positions and units sold – somewhere between a company CEO, Jay Z (his declared role model) and a directeur sportif. Of course, Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr is “young, black, fly and handsome” too (Handsome), as photogenic on the cover of GQ as he is on the cover of Time magazine, being profiled as a Next Generation Leader. On the unapologetic Pop Boy, Stormzy notes that he has become a London “top boy” without actually having to become a gangland supremo.That top boy reference now works internationally too, thanks to the recent Netflix reboot of the Channel 4 crime saga of that name. If Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer enabled Stormzy to headline Glastonbury, Heavy Is the Head makes a bid for Stateside attention too: never before has UK hip-hop had such traction there.The spaciousness, punch and depth of these productions is telling, but it is a mark of the album’s artistic integrity that Stormzy manages to transcend genre (again) without sacrificing his core griminess, or losing too much in the way of accent, word choice, content or theme. There are no obvious North American rapper hook-ups the Hand of Drake is absent.HER is one well-chosen US guest vocalist on One Second, an emotive plea to take time and calculate one’s wellbeing, just as Afrobeats superstar Burna Boy is an apposite, timely guest on Own It – this album’s sole, sultry come-hither.The brassy fanfares that open and close Big Michael, though, are played by London jazz players. Grime’s favourite insult – “suck your mum” – recurs a handful of times, and the busily polyrhythmic Superheroes works as an extended shout out to black British talent, name-checking Malorie Blackman and Dave.But pugnacious localism is only part of Stormzy’s appeal. Heavy Is the Head once again highlights the personal downsides of recognition. Weariness is nothing new in hip-hop – rappers have been counting the cost of being the boss for decades. Gang Signs \u0026amp Prayer, too, made it clear that Michael Omari felt ambivalent about the noblesse oblige of starriness.Stormzy, though, manages to keep this tired trope fresh. His regrets are legion: the friends for whom he was not there, the street pain from which he is now just a little removed, “the little things”.“They’re sayin’ I’m the voice of young black youth, I say ‘yeah, cool’ and bun my zoot,” he eye-rolls on Crown. While many artists spark up as an act of hedonism or rebellion, Stormzy often smokes his weed in an act of self-medication. There are repeated pleas throughout the album for self-care – to take time out, to remember to breathe, not to let one’s dreams disrupt one’s sleep too much. Exasperation at being misunderstood or misrepresented is never far away, though. “I’m not the poster boy for mental health!” Stormzy exclaims at one point. Another track seethes at the flak Stormzy received for starting a Cambridge scholarship for BAME students (“it’s not anti-white it’s pro-black,” he points out).For all that Stormzy is well able to carry the weight of representing not just south London, British blackness and now the UK creative industries as well, his game does drop sharply on one key track. It is tempting to hear Lessons as an extended apology to Stormzy’s ex, the broadcaster Maya Jama – the two split up earlier this year amid rumours of his infidelity. (That narrative seems borne out by lines like “You gave me the world and I gave you disrespect”.) But Stormzy can only muster sentimental prose here, rather than memorable poetry – a common problem when aggressive rhymers find themselves out of water, floundering in their “feels”. Still: we sorely need better flows about love, not strings of cliches.Bum notes are relatively few, however. The 50-odd minutes of Heavy Is the Head passes in a blur of street status and lyrical power, tempered by nuanced considerations of sacrifice. One reason the crown feels so heavy on Stormzy’s head is that he is acutely aware of the shoulders on which he stands, of the timing that is one aspect to his success. So many previous MCs enjoyed chart heat without becoming national treasures. Dizzee Rascal, Wiley, Lethal Bizzle, Skepta and Kano have all made bids for the crown at one time or another, all too often with the club-grime hybrids that marked the decade where MCs could not perform live due to the politan police’s notorious, now defunct Form 696 policy.Ours is an often bewildering era, but that grime is now an export, and that Stormzy is the country’s unofficial poet laureate, is a particularly shiny silver lining."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7679c932ee4d1c93b3633b4b97422fff893d117/0_232_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45cb25ef66ab724e8a25b203c1e1430f","title":"election 2019 john crace on the lowlights and the gaffes","story":"’s political sketch writer, John Crace, runs through the highs and the many, many lows of the 2019 general election campaign.

How we Brits have smiled at this con man’s Teflon gift. Could never happen here.But consider the lessons political managers around the world might have learned about our election and how we struggled to negotiate the increasingly blurred lines between truth and falsehood facts and propoganda openness and stealth accountability and impunity clarity and confusion news and opinion.It rather looks as if one or two skilled backroom manipulators (we can guess) studied Trump’s ability to persuade enough people that black is white and, rather than recoil in disgust, came to the opposite conclusion: it works.One far off day we will discover whether 40 new hospitals will be built, and whether 20,000 new police officers will materialise along with 50,000 “new” nurses. It won’t be long before we learn whether we’ve now finally got Brexit “done” or whether this is just the start of a long and painful process of negotiating our future trading relationships with a greatly weakened hand.We’ll learn the reality of whether there is to be frictionless trade between the mainland of Britain and the island of Ireland. We will read the truth about alleged Russian interference in the 2016 Brexit referendum … and much more. But by then life will have moved on, and maybe many of us will have forgotten the promises, evasions and outright lies of late 2019.Lessons learned? That, in an age of information chaos, you can get away with almost any amount of misleading. You can doctor videos suppress information avoid challenging interviews – but only after your opponents have beenthoroughly grilled. You can expel dissenting journalists from the press pack or hide in a fridge. You can rebrand a fake “fact-checking” website. In the end, none of it matters.Coin one unforgettable message and stick to it. “Get Brexit done” was brilliant, never mind that the meaning of “Brexit” and “done” was far from clear: this is an age of simplicity, not complexity. Even the so-called mainstream media will do far more to amplify that slogan rather than question it. Try this stunt: slap the words on a JCB digger and drive it through a pile of polystyrene bricks ... and watch as news editors obligingly clear their front pages for the image. They are making posters, not doing journalism.And remember that in most countries, governments have unusual power over public service broadcasters. So, in the event that television journalists seem to be getting too big for their boots, it is often useful to drop a heavy hint there will be a price to pay. Maybe Channel 4 has outlived its usefulness? Possibly it’s time to privatise the BBC? That should do the trick.Old-fashioned press conferences should be kept to the minimum. A manifesto should say almost nothing. Gaffe-prone colleagues should be “disappeared”. If in real trouble, make things up. You’ll be amazed how readily even the best journalists will repeat unattributable fictions (see the “row” over the four-year-old boy in Leeds General Infirmary and what “happened” during the subsequent visit of health secretary Matt Hancock). By the time the journalists have corrected themselves and Twitter has spent 24 hours arguing about the truth, the world will have moved on.So, as Trump has discovered, the liars, myth-makers and manipulators are in the ascendancy – and however valiantly inidual journalists attempt to hold them to account (and many, especially at a local level, have tried magnificently) the dice are loaded against them.The one over-riding thought is that for many years I looked at US newspapers and pitied colleagues there who “just” ran the newsroom, leaving comment pages to others. Pity has turned to envy. I now think it would be cleansing for all British national newspapers to split the responsibility for news and comment. It’s simply too hard for the average reader – especially, but not only online – to tell the difference.And a hero? After the Yorkshire Evening Post\u0027s reporting of the Leeds story was questioned, its editor in chief, James Mitchinson, wrote a long and considered reply to a reader who, on the basis of something she read on social media, thought the story was fake. Mitchinson’s reply courteously asks the reader why she would believe the word of a total stranger (who might not even exist) over a newspaper she had read for many years in good faith.The fact the paper knew the story to be true was, said Mitchinson, down to “bog-standard journalism”. It was a powerful statement of why good journalism – independent and decently crafted – should matter. So let’s hear it for bog-standard journalism. There’s too little of it.

Real change indeed!It’s that point in the political cycle when all decisions taken by the winning side are reinterpreted as being works of strategic genius. According to this logic, Boris Johnson’s failure to use a mop, confiscation of a journalist’s phone and recourse to hiding in a fridge suddenly became inspired moves that captured the zeitgeist. Expect more MPs to opt to shelter in white goods next time around. Indeed, several Labour MPs have already offered Jeremy Corbyn a place in their freezer.When it comes to snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, it’s hard to look past the Liberal Democrats.

Such has been the attrition rate of Lib Dem leaders since 2015 that the job is beginning to look rather less attractive than taking up drumming for Spinal Tap.Commiserations to the DUP, who couldn’t maintain the spin that they’re master negotiators. Having rejected one Brexit deal that protected the union, they ended up with a border down the Irish Sea and an election that ousted the party’s Westminster leader. Top marks, however, to shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon. Playing down his future ambitions, Burgon told an interviewer: “I’m not going to get into the question of leader or deputy leader.” High minded, for sure, though slightly undermined by the fact that no one had mentioned the role of deputy leader. Something on your mind, Richard?Kudos to Labour, which has lost 2,582,853 votes since the last election. It means it has shed an impressively profligate 2,816 votes a day since the 2017 poll. For all the criticism of Corbyn, it’s proof that he has lived up to his promise of inspiring a mass movement. He’s surely overachieved – that’s more of a stampede."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/001f8f1801a1eda9a946cb61d3d4564da7a2375d/0_0_6480_3888/master/6480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4882af592ff3858c39c3d0a4f7101f3c","title":"housing charities and food banks report spike in donations after tory win","story":"Organisations protecting the vulnerable such as Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund welcomed contributionsCharities helping the most vulnerable in society have reported an increase in support after the Conservative victory in the general election.Shelter, Refuge, the Trussell Trust and the Biscuit Fund have all confirmed they have seen a sharp increase in donations andor registered supporters as a result of the election outcome.While unable to give exact numbers, the UK homelessness and housing charity Shelter said it had seen an increase in the number of people signing up as supporters since the result.The Biscuit Fund, which raises money to provide in-need families with supplies ranging from fridges to food hampers amid welfare cuts, said it had also had a considerable boost in support. Between Friday and Saturday, the charity has received almost £3,000 in donations – a number that a spokesperson has described as “significant and very welcome”.The UK’s largest food bank charity, the Trussell Trust, said it had been “overwhelmed” following a huge uplift in donations. While it could not yet give an exact figure, a spokesperson confirmed that hundreds of people have got in touch to set up a monthly donation or make a one-off payment.The boost in support comes as many across the country have expressed despair at the Conservatives, who have overseen nearly a decade of deep cuts to public services since they came to power in 2010, winning the election.Emma Revie, the chief executive of the Trussell Trust, said: “We’re overwhelmed by the wave of support we’ve seen. Thank you so much to everyone who has been donating – we’re incredibly grateful. We know we can reach a future where no one needs a food bank, but we can’t do it alone. We must work together – this can change.”Sandra Horley CBE, the chief executive of Refuge, said: “Now that the general election is behind us, we implore the incoming Conservative government to work on addressing violence against women and girls. The government needs to make this a priority and commit funds and resources to doing so.“Survivors have waited too long already. The domestic abuse bill, which was lost due to the snap election, needs to be quickly reinstated and strengthened to be a truly transformative piece of legislation.“We need an immediate commitment to new funds for refuges, which face closure up and down the country. No woman or child should be turned away when they seek help, survivors need to know that help and support is there for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/445ed9ad0efee344c4eba8df6e9d3c93bb85c02f/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ecbe62db80b379e160c85fc49c445a30","title":"i saw just how many voters were hostile to jeremy corbyn","story":"The Observer’s political editor found that, no matter how able the candidates, they couldn’t sell the party leadership on the doorstepA few days before voters went to the polls on Thursday, the Labour MP Neil Coyle was out campaigning in his Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency. A man answered the door and told Coyle bluntly not to bother leaving a leaflet because he regarded his leader as a terrorist sympathiser and wanted nothing to do with him, or anyone associated with Labour.On another occasion, Coyle was confronted by a father on the school run who turned the air blue in front of his own child, using a four-letter word to sum up his view of Jeremy Corbyn. “There were people who said they knew Boris Johnson was a liar and a cheat but they still preferred him over our leader,” Coyle said.He and his team talked to 10,000 people during the campaign and kept a record of what each of them said. The two reasons most often given by those who decided against Labour were its policy on Brexit and dislike of the leader. “Dislike of Corbyn came top,” added Coyle, who was one of the Labour survivors on election night. He retained his south London seat with a big – though reduced – majority. But for hundreds of other candidates, including many fighting Labour target seats, countering the Corbyn factor proved impossible.Journalists who went on the campaign trail were struck constantly by the force of anti-Corbyn feeling on doorsteps. On a visit to the target seat of Norwich North, halfway through the campaign, the first voter I encountered when following the impressive Labour candidate Karen Davis round a housing estate dismissed Corbyn as a “twat”.For half an hour afterwards Davis, who has a job in charge of social inclusion on the local council, seemed reluctant to knock on more doors with me, and let her helpers face the voters instead. It seemed to me that she knew, from bitter experience, that the next responses were likely to be just as hostile. As we walked round, she told me that there was lots of poverty in that part of Norwich and that she would be returning to many of the same houses after polling day in her social inclusion role, a tacit admission that she held out little hope of becoming an MP.Norwich North was near the top of Labour’s target list. But none of Davis’s literature mentioned Corbyn at all. I approached a man in his garden on the same Norwich estate who said: “I have voted Labour all my life but I can’t stand Corbyn and won’t vote for him.” Davis came over and urged him to change his mindset and think of the Corbyn leadership as a “management blip” as she did her best to talk him around.Up and down the country, Labour candidates were all too aware what their biggest problem was. But they had to keep quiet about it while campaigning. One Labour MP told me on Friday morning, after details of Labour’s catastrophic defeat were known: “We all knew what was coming, just not quite how bad it would be. We didn’t want to allow the Corbynistas and Momentum to blame us and point the finger at us afterwards, so there had to be an unspoken agreement to deny it.”Many Labour MPs had been observing this same vow of silence about Corbyn for more than three years, since they mounted a failed coup to oust him in 2016. They thought there was nothing for it but to allow him to fail on his own.When shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth was caught on tape, in the last few days of campaigning, telling a Conservative friend that it was looking “dire for Labour” because of a “combination of Corbyn and Brexit”, he was only saying what fellow candidates had known all along.Despite the overwhelming evidence, team Corbyn denies completely that it was the leader who repelled voters. Corbyn, when acknowledging Labour’s defeat in the early hours of Friday, refused to accept any personal responsibility for his second general election loss, and said he would stay in office during a “period of reflection”, before stepping down. He, shadow chancellor John McDonnell and party chairman Ian Lavery all insisted Brexit had drowned out Labour’s popular policy agenda, and that the leader had not been the problem. This has infuriated MPs and defeated candidates, who see it as evidence of the Corbynistas’ determination to hold on to the levers of power in order to install a successor in exactly the same mould as Corbyn who will deliver more of the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90d8a19496cd647ac94cef0a1136582cb6b0cf37/0_184_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6979eec2e82315c20e0b324d25832b76","title":"rewilding how trees for life are renewing the highlands","story":"Helped by volunteers, Trees for Life planted nearly 2m native trees on its Scottish projects. It wants to plant millions more The bracken-clad hills are marked “Dundreggan forest” on the map but this Scottish glen is mostly stark Highland scenery: open, beautiful, and almost totally devoid of trees.On a steep-sided little gully, 40 years ago, a few baby silver birches escaped relentless browsing by red deer and grew tall. Now, the nearby path through the bracken is dusted with thousands of brown specks: birch seeds.“Each year, this ‘forest’ produces trillions of birch seed,” says Doug Gilbert, the operations manager for the charity Trees for Life at Dundreggan. “Until we reduce the deer pressure, not a single one has grown into a tree. Once we get the deer population right, this forest will absolutely take off. It’s starting to do that now.”The charity purchased the Dundreggan hunting estate 11 years ago. Slowly – “at tree speed,” smiles Gilbert – it is rewilding 4,000 hectares (10,000 acres) of this degraded Highland landscape, restoring a ersity of native trees, scrub and associated life, from the dark bordered beauty moth to black grouse and, yes, red deer.Trees for Life is one of four charities chosen for the  and Observer’s 2019 climate emergency appeal, each of which is committed to renewing nature and the planet by planting and protecting trees, forests and woodland. Increasingly, Trees for Life’s aims – to revive Scotland’s native forests with practical rewilding that includes Scottish people at its heart – are chiming with the times. During the general election campaign, politicians desperately tried to outbid each other with tree-planting pledges. Who doesn’t love a tree? More trees can tackle the climate crisis – absorbing carbon dioxide – and the bioersity crisis. But Trees for Life’s efforts reveal it is not quite so simple.The first step at Dundreggan has been to increase deer culling. Ecologists calculate that a red deer population of five per sq km in the wider landscape will allow natural regeneration in many Highland regions it is 20. But culling deer is controversial because the value of stalking that estates base on deer numbers. Trees for Life has proceeded slowly with culling, seeking positive dialogue with neighbouring stalking estates. They’ve also tried non-lethal methods such as bagpipe-playing volunteers acting as nocturnal deer scarers. Trees and deer can coexist and Dundreggan’s deer population is now at a level where some young birches, pines, rowans and junipers will grow tall.“We would like to let the trees come on their own,” says Steve Micklewight, the chief executive. “But because this land has been so bare for so long, there isn’t the erse seed source to make this happen.”So, helped by volunteers, Trees for Life has planted nearly 2 million native trees so far at Dundreggan and on its other Scottish projects. It wants to plant millions more.All the trees come from Scottish seeds – meaning they are suited to Highland climates and species, as well as being free of novel diseases. Half have been grown from seeds collected around Dundreggan. Its on-site nursery bristles with 94,000 saplings.Seed-collecting is not as simple as it sounds. Seed must come from a wide variety of inidual trees to ensure genetic ersity. Cones from Scots pines have to be harvested before they drop to the ground, so specialist tree-climbers are employed. Trees for Life specialises in growing non-commercial high-mountain species such as woolly willow and dwarf birch. Surviving specimens are often only found on cliffs and crevices – with seeds or cuttings only retrievable by specialist climbers.Because of the deer grazing, every sapling is planted within a fenced enclosure (costing £10 per metre). Fencing is “a little bit of an admission of failure,” says Gilbert. In the long term, when reducing deer numbers becomes less controversial, trees won’t need fences. Gilbert hopes the fences will last 30 years, when the well-established trees and scrub will survive browsing deer.At first, Dundreggan’s biggest fenced enclosure looks dominated by bracken. But crouch down, and the horizon is fuzzy with young trees: downy birch, rowan, and plump little Scots pines. There are no straight lines – it is emphatically not a “plantation” like the rigid blocks of non-native sitka spruce on the far side of the glen. (Trees for Life are concerned that politicians’ tree-planting pledges will lead to new non-native commercial plantations, which are disastrous for most wildlife).At Dundreggan, life is beginning to return. A black grouse shoots up and a raven scuds on the wind, prospecting for the small mammals and young birds in the burgeoning scrub. Gilbert has a better word for scrub: elfin forest.“It’s getting to the blue touch-paper stage,” says Micklewight. “You plant the trees and not much visible happens for seven years as the roots slowly build. Then it suddenly moves quite fast. We’re just about to see that at Dundreggan. The trees in the ground enable the landscape to take off.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ab850a37b0d76a19b84a6f62cc05c1fbee097ce/86_0_4906_2944/master/4906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0d9b6c6b8e17786a1664208280752f","title":"champions cup rugby","story":"• Danny Cipriani misses the match with a bug• Irish province score two tries in last six minutesRobin Copeland’s last-gasp try rescued a 27-24 win from the jaws of defeat as Connacht pipped Gloucester in a dramatic Champions Cup clash in Galway.Despite missing some key men, including Danny Cipriani who was pulled from the bench with a bug, Gloucester were on course to complete a Pool Five double over the Irish province thanks to tries from Gerbrandt Grobler, Mark Atkinson (2) and the captain, Lewis Ludlow.Connacht’s 10-7 half-time lead was turned into a 24-13 deficit as they stared at a European exit but, with the flanker Ludlow in the sin-bin, they delighted the home crowd with converted tries from Shane Delahunt and Copeland during a frantic final six minutes.The result keeps both sides’ quarter-final hopes alive, although defeating both Toulouse and Montpellier next month is a big ask.

The company’s own pitch is that production won’t even begin until 2021, with owners receiving their first shipments in 2022. But the gap is relevant to Tesla’s future: where the company was once genuinely ahead of the curve, in making beautiful electric cars that people wanted to buy, it has increasingly relied on beating its competitors to announcements, rather than actually shipping. The list of Elon Musk’s as-yet-unfulfilled promises grows every year – but the electric fleets of BMW, Ford, General Motors and others grow faster.One of the most impressive, and futuristic, products to have come from Google in recent years, Duplex is an AI assistant that can make calls to local businesses on your behalf to do things like book appointments and find out opening times. The tool was criticised when the company first revealed it, for being so good that its use could plausibly be described as “deceptive”: the AI assistant even injects “um” and “er” into speech to sound more human. That, combined with the difficulties of gaining consent for receiving an automated cold call, means that GDPR might well keep the technology from European shores for years to come.For Brits, 5G is technically here already, with multiple networks offering the ultrafast mobile standard in denser urban areas. But there are few devices that support the new standard yet – and fewer still that are acceptable to the gadget-obsessed early adopters who would otherwise be first on board, since the flagship devices from manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Apple continue to be 4G only. That will change in 2020, when you can expect hardware like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S11 to support the faster connections.It’s been years since any consumer app broke through into the mainstream – with an honourable exception for TikTok among the under-25s – and that trend shows no real sign of curving upwards in 2020. Between the dominance of default apps from Apple and Google, and the ability of the major platforms to acquire, clone or kill upstart competitors, it’s a hard time to be a consumer software company. Harder still to become one of the 28 who get a coveted spot on a typical user’s homescreen, rather than being buried in a folder.It was always hubristic for Facebook to release an Echo competitor. The company had no real expertise in building hardware, nor an obvious strategy for getting its products to market: it may own the world’s most valuable advertising real estate, but it’s not a store. Then Cambridge Analytica broke, and Portal went from a bold idea to a bad one. Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes? The answer, it seems, is “not many people”, because Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year don’t expect a third.Virtual reality has been the “next big thing” for five years, and has been a big thing for precisely none of those. But just when it was on its way out, there’s the potential for one last flurry of attention, thanks to the work of PC gaming company Valve. The company announced a new edition of its beloved Half-Life series, the first since 2007, would be exclusive to its VR headset. There have been few titles that can encourage non-believers to spend the thousands required to get high-quality VR at home, but Half-Life: Alyx is one. Whether it sparks a lasting resurgence, or just a final flash in the pan, remains to be seen.Alexa has been coming to new products at an impressive clip. Amazon has incorporated its voice assistant into almost every gadget it makes, and a good few it doesn’t. But, even though voice assistants remain popular among their devotees, privacy concerns are only growing among the cohort of refuseniks who want nothing to do with always-on microphones. If Ford, for instance, starts losing out on sales because of an overly ambitious plan to put Alexa in everything, you can be certain they’ll reassess that integration rapidly.The two worst-kept secrets in technology are Apple’s biggest experimental projects: a pair of augmented-reality glasses and a self-driving car, both being developed in Cupertino. The glasses have a path to release, and references to them in the code for Apple products have started showing up in beta tests and other leaks. The car, for now, has no existence outside of a few offices in Sunnyvale and some suspicious hires from companies like Tesla. But, at the earliest, the glasses won’t hit shelves until 2021, and Apple is always wary about pre-announcing things.Video gaming has been quiet for the past few years. With Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s in houses across the nation, Microsoft and Sony turned their attention to intra-generational upgrades and cheaper models designed to be a second console. Nintendo took a different path, releasing the Switch and upending what a home console could be. And Fortnite rendered the whole thing moot anyway, as the most popular game in the world worked on every console, PCs, and even mobile phones. But 2020 will see the launch of a new Xbox, a new Playstation, a new Halo and a new Last of Us – and the return to playgrounds nationwide of tiresome debates about which is better.While the European Union was hammering out the details of 2019’s copyright directive, Google began one of its largest lobbying efforts to date. The company was incensed by two proposals – articles 13 and 15 of the draft bill – which it dubbed the “upload filter” and the “link tax”. Passage of the directive, it implied, could result in the end of YouTube in Europe for good. It mobilised thousands of YouTubers in opposition, and sparked group hysteria among tween fandoms on Instagram and elsewhere. While inidual nations ratify the legislation, expect more protest and legal challenges, but ultimately Google may gain from article 13: after all, they are well placed to build and license the content filters required to police copyrighted material.Simon Shooter, a partner at law firm Bird \u0026amp Bird, predicts that 2020 will see “the escalation of the cyberwar, with AI in use on both sides of the ide”. Hackers have long been experimenting with automatic tools for breaking into and exploiting corporate and government networks, but the need to stay undetectable has limited the use of AI in practice. As the cyber cold war heats up, however, that could change.The rise of TikTok may have concerned the adults in the room, who see the company’s role in exporting Beijing’s censorship and slow adoption of child protection standards as reasons for caution. But among the younger generation, it could have the opposite effect, cementing a perception of China as the home of cool products and services. Who would win if that happened? “The success of TikTok will not have gone unnoticed by Tencent, which owns WeChat,” says Tamara Littleton, CEO at social media agency the Social Element. “It has struggled to gain traction in other countries… but I predict they will make a play for the UK and US audience with a slightly tailored version.”The only people with the power to change how Silicon Valley works are inside Silicon Valley. Employee activism burst through in a big way in 2018, with Google workers walking out over sexual harassment and plans to open up a censored search engine in China, Microsoft workers campaigning against working with the US Department of Defense and Amazon workers joining in protests against working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Apple, the largest of them all, has so far kept its staff from expressing public dissent. Whether that’s through the carrot or the stick is unknown – but with the company coming under increasing pressure for its craven stance towards both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it surely cannot last.Both Apple and Google launched their screen time controls in 2018, and upgraded them this year. Ross Sleight, chief strategy officer at tech accelerator Somo, thinks this trend will continue – and will start to impact on regulation. “Many people are now very aware of their addictive habits and are trying to disengage,” he says. “A shared responsibility for wellbeing falls on to each one of us: the companies designing applications and user interfaces that play on our psychology, but also on policy makers.” How that would look in practice is likely to be the result of years of legal wrangling – but watch the proposals bubble up over the next year.Loot boxes, treasure crates, card packs – whatever they’re called, the practice of offering randomised rewards for real money has gained an increasingly bad reputation. Stories of children spending hundreds of pounds of their parents money – and adults spending thousands of pounds of their own – back up the perception of the offerings as closer to unregulated gambling than a fun aspect of video games in the 21st century. Self-regulation might be on the cards if the industry showed the slightest interest in doing it, but the billions it rakes in from the practice (Fifa loot boxes resulted in more than half of EA’s 2017 revenue from game add-ons) makes a voluntary change unlikely.In the past decade, hundreds of small sites were launched with venture capital cash, riding a wave of social media distribution and programmatic adverts to a peak of bubbly excess, before it burst in 2016 and they dropped like flies. In the US, consolidation has seen some outlets close, others merge, and still more lay off hundreds of employees in total, and the trend shows no sign of abating. The biggest scalps have already been claimed, but 2020 could be a time when smaller sites start to lose out, like the hyper-partisan news outlets that so shaped the 2017 election, or the few remaining independent blogs that have eked out a living on reader support and savings.The smartphone industry seems to be following the trend set by Gillette and one-upping itself on an annual basis. Other phones already have four cameras, so why not Apple? The company would have a good reason for adding another lens: while the iPhone 11 Pro is perhaps the best smartphone camera on the market, it falls far short in one specific area, with just a 2x optical zoom at the highest level. So a bigger zoom lens would be well received by any users who like shooting big things far away or small things nearby.The online harms white paper, revealed in a blaze of publicity in the summer of 2019, has gone nowhere. The prime minister who commissioned it is out, as is the culture secretary who launched it. Whoever sits at the head of cabinet in 2020 is unlikely to want to progress this odd legislation, assembled as it is from a mishmash of -pleasing statements about harmful but not illegal speech. And they’re unlikely to have the parliamentary time to do so even if they did want to.

papers detail us dysfunction we did not know what we were doing","story":"A key theme of the trove of documents published this week was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outsetIn the midst of Barack Obama’s much-vaunted military surge against the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2010, Hayam Mohammed, an elder from Panjwai near the Pakistani border confronted an officer from the US 101st Airborne who had come into his village.That surge, which like so many other initiatives in Afghanistan’s long war was celebrated as a huge success, today serves only as a grim reminder of the deception and failure revealed in the explosive Afghanistan papers published by the Washington Post this week.Like that secret history, the Afghanistan Papers’ accumulated oral history depicts a war mired in failure – in sharp contrast to the “misleading” story told to the US and British publics by officials in massaged figures and over-optimistic assessments.But even if that deception has been the main focus of reporting, the hundreds of interviews – with senior generals and Afghan governors, with ambassadors, aid officials and policy advisers – also tell another story: how successive presidents from Bush through Obama to Donald Trump, publicly rejected “nation-building” but created a violent, corrupt and dysfunctional state only barely propped up by US arms.They detail too how – like the Soviet Union before them – the US and its allies came so badly unstuck in Afghanistan through a combination of hubris and ignorance, and with a political leadership – both under Obama and Bush – more concerned with domestic politics than the impact of their decisions on Afghanistan.Reading at times like an extended exercise in blame, the interviews trace a widespread desire among participants to nail down an original sin for the failures in Afghanistan even to seek an exculpation for a conflict that has cost $1tn and the lives of tens of thousands over almost 20 years.From the shortcomings of the US military’s newly rewritten counter-insurgency doctrine – described by one interviewee as “colonial” in its conceit – to a tolerance of widespread corruption and “warlordism” blamed for fueling the resurgence of the Taliban, a key theme of many of those who spoke to Sigar was the lack of coherence in Washington’s approach to Afghanistan from the outset.From the very beginning, as Richard Haas – the former US government policy coordinator for Afghanistan – confided in his interview, there was little enthusiasm in George W Bush’s White House for the country once the Taliban was driven out in 2001.Other interviewee subjects, however, place the initial failure even further back: with the original decision to elide the Taliban with Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaida in the wake of the September 11 attacks.Among people like Jeffrey Eggers, a former US Navy Seal and staffer on the National Security Council in the George Bush and Obama administrations, this the key point.For Richard Boucher, assistant secretary of state for south and central Asian affairs between 2006 and 2009, the contradictions in the aims framed a mission that appeared founded on impossibility.“If we think our exit strategy is to either beat the Taliban – which can’t be done given the local, regional, and cross border circumstances – or to establish an Afghan government that is capable of delivering good government to its citizens using American tools and methods, then we do not have an exit strategy because both of those are impossible.”His summation, however, was even more scathing: “We did not know what we were doing.”The lack of vision at the war’s start, which left the US and its allies racing to catch up as US attention turned quickly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, was only exacerbated by the decisions that would belatedly get made in response to the rapidly resurgent Taliban in the middle of the last decade.“Every nation was in charge of protecting an area larger than they had forces to do so with, and if you don’t have enough forces to protect what you’re trying to do, stabilization can’t be done.”“No inidual is to blame,” he added bleakly: “The system let everyone down.”But if there is one issue with the Afghanistan papers, however, it is that they represent the views of a selection of insiders who were at one time or another invested in the success of the war, often unable to step outside the sometimes arcane disagreements they were steeped in.Austin Wright, an academic who specialises in Afghanistan at the University of Chicago, and has made a study of the declassified military records of the war, offers an outsider’s perspective from his reading of the interviews.Wright notes that many in the media have picked up on the acknowledgment by the head of Sigar, John J Sopko, asserting the US public was “misled” consistently by official accounting of progress of the war. But he believes that focus misses the fact that many in leadership positions also misinterpreted their own data concerning the nature, intentions and capabilities of the Taliban at key points in the conflict in their desire to see signs of victory.Wright points to US military and Nato surveys that indicated that at key points, including after their initial defeat, the Taliban simply withdrew either to regroup or instill a false sense of progress, echoing the observation made by village elder Hayam Mohammed at the height of the 2010 surge.“The Taliban are strategic and patient,” says Wright. “They are also skillful at manipulating the information being seen in the field to maximise any political process.“What you see – during the Obama era handover of leadership to Afghan forces for example – is a significant reduction in violence across large areas where there are foreign forces. But what the survey data also showed was a continuing Taliban presence, not necessarily fighting but not going away.“Then, when you see the actual physical withdrawal of US troops, you see an increase in violence again. What that tells you is that they have been sitting it out to until the cost of re-intervention becomes too high.”The sense of overdue re-evaluation is not confined to just those interviewed by Sigar but shared by many who served in senior roles in Afghanistan.“I remember thinking at the time I was running around Helmand that we should be able to do this, whatever that thing was,” a former British diplomat who served in the region told the Observer.“But in retrospect, it was not realistic because while we were pissing into sand in Helmand you have to look at bigger picture.“And by the time people realised that the Taliban were coming back it was too late.”A very reasonable question was what would have happened if the international community had delivered the investment and committed the resources in 2003-04 that were delivered 2008-10.The diplomat responds to a point made by Gen Dan McNeill, the former US and Nato commander in Afghanistan, Dan McNeill, who in his interview with Sigar complained that even before his first deployment in 2002 he could not find anyone able to give him a definition of what “winning meant”.“If you can’t define ‘winnable’ how do you define if the war is lost. What is clear,” he added looking to the future, “is that there is going to be an ongoing low level of commitment for a long time to come in terms training and in terms of trying to prevent Afghanistan becoming a serious problem again.“You can argue that you are preventing Afghanistan being used as an operational base for the really bad guys, but then there are plenty of other options for them. In terms of what we were trying to achieve does that mean loss?” He thinks for a moment.“It probably does. Certainly we took a bloody nose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec7b957e7098f96302e6e560fb14518d029c887e/0_204_6123_3674/master/6123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0f7b1fe63d15a8c0d328090610fa960","title":"cryptocurrency exhumation gerald cotten investors canada","story":"Lawyers for customers of an insolvent cryptocurrency exchange have asked police to exhume the body of the company’s founder, amid efforts to recover about $190m in Bitcoin which were locked in an online black hole after his death.Miller Thomson LLP sent a letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Friday, requesting authorities “conduct an exhumation and postmortem autopsy” on the body of Gerald Cotten, founder of QuadrigaCX, citing what the firm called the “questionable circumstances” around his death earlier this year.Citing “decomposition concerns”, lawyers requested the exhumation be completed no later than spring 2020.Gerald Cotten, 30, died abruptly in December 2018 of complications relating to Crohn’s disease while on honeymoon in Jaipur, India, with his wife, Jennifer Robertson. His body was repatriated to Canada and a funeral was held in Halifax, Nova Scotia.Soon after his death, however, reports surfaced that nearly 80,000 users of QuadrigaCX – at the time Canada’s largest cryptocurrency exchange – were unable to access funds totalling more $190m.Cotten was the only one with access to necessary permissions. While Robertson has possession of the laptop containing the necessary passwords, she remains locked out.“The laptop computer from which Gerry carried out the companies’ business is encrypted and I do not know the password or recovery key. Despite repeated and diligent searches, I have not been able to find them written down anywhere,” she said in court filings.Uncertainty about the missing funds has fueled speculation that Cotten may still be alive. In their letter to the RCMP the law firm underlined the “need for certainty around the question of whether Mr Cotten is in fact deceased”.They also found a substantial amount of money was used to fund a lavish lifestyle for the couple, including the use of private jets and luxury vehicles. Ernst \u0026amp Young was able to recover $24m in cash and $9m in assets held by Robertson.Both Canada’s tax authorities and the FBI are also investigating the company."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31288a7e70cfb200749d83674acc7304cd8527c2/0_14_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e9b3ce636603a32fb9b694140b754ac","title":"brazils amazon deforestation this year nearly size of puerto rico says agency","story":"Destruction of the world’s largest tropical rainforest in November more than doubled the same period last year Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon jumped to the highest level for the month of November since record-keeping began in 2015, according to preliminary government data published.Destruction of the world’s largest tropical rainforest totalled 563 square kms in November, which is more than double the area in the same month last year, according to the country’s space research agency INPE on Friday.Deforestation usually slows around November and December during the Amazon region’s rainy season. The number for last month was unusually high.Researchers and environmentalists blame rightwing president Jair Bolsonaro for emboldening ranchers and loggers by calling for the Amazon to be developed and for weakening the environmental agency called Ibama.Bolsonaro and environment minister Ricardo Salles have said previous governments played a role in deforestation’s increase, saying policies including budget cuts at agencies like Ibama were in place well before the new government took office on 1 January.Brazil’s environment ministry had no immediate comment on Friday on the new data for November.The data released by the space research agency was collected through a system that publishes alerts on fires and other types of developments affecting the rainforest.

Does she have any regrets?The night before I meet Lisa Bloom, the BBC screens its interview with Virginia Giuffre, the woman who has accused Prince Andrew of having sex with her after she was trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein. It is a bombshell of an interview, with Giuffre giving a detailed account of her alleged encounters with the prince. It is also classic Bloom territory: for the past decade, the American lawyer’s name has been synonymous with high-profile cases in which a woman accuses a powerful man of sexual misconduct, often played out in the glare of camera lights. With her signature mix of legal aggression and media friendliness, Bloom has represented women against both Bill Cosby and Fox News host Bill O’Reilly – and won. In the O’Reilly case, she forced the Fox network to engage by filming her client calling the company’s sexual harassment hotline, and posting the video on Twitter. More accusers came forward, advertisers fled, and O’Reilly was done. Bloom handles publicity the way a samurai wields a sword.Bloom is not representing Giuffre. But she is representing five other women who claim Epstein abused them, as well as two others who say they remember seeing Giuffre with Prince Andrew at the London nightclub Tramp in 2001, on the night at the centre of the allegations. (The prince has insisted this encounter was “impossible”, his unforgettable alibi being that he was at Pizza Express in Woking at the time. He has also denied having sex with Giuffre.)Bloom has flown from her home in Los Angeles to London ahead of the Giuffre interview, because ITV have asked for her take on it. “A lot of other networks wanted me to come on to discuss this as well,” she tells me. As every transatlantic TV station knows, if you’ve got an item on a case about sexual misconduct, there are only two lawyers to call: one is Bloom, and the other is the even more famous and fearsome Gloria Allred, Bloom’s mother.At 58, Bloom is bright-eyed and chipper, seemingly unaffected by jet lag, which she puts down to her vegan diet. She has the kind of blow dried, honey-coloured hair that suggests a monthly maintenance allowance that exceeds most people’s rent. Even though I was up three times the night before with a crying baby, Bloom can’t tell me often enough how terrific and young I look (I’m 41). “Whatever you’re doing, keep doing it!” she says when we meet in a photographer’s studio in London. She radiates a synthetic warmth.As well as doing the media rounds, Bloom has also spent this trip helping her sixth client, who lives in London, prepare her story. “My client came to me about a week ago, to say, I was there and it was very memorable because somebody said, ‘Look it’s Prince Andrew!’ She thought, ‘Wow! A royal!’ She also saw Virginia looking very serious, not having a good time, whereas Andrew was having a good time, smiling a lot. So I’m gathering the evidence that she has, and will take her to Scotland Yard if they’re interested, which they should be. The FBI says they’re investigating. I haven’t seen any evidence of it, so they must be doing it privately,” she says dryly.Of Bloom’s five other clients on the Epstein case, four live in the US, and one in Japan. Only one, a model known as Kiki, has given up her anonymity, recently appearing on a US talkshow with Bloom by her side. Dozens of lawyers are now involved in the case, including, inevitably, Allred, who is representing other women. While each suit is unique and handled by an inidual lawyer, the attorneys are also working together with Epstein’s estate to establish a victims’ compensation fund. Epstein was found dead in his jail cell last August, apparently having killed himself, so compensation rather than litigation is the primary focus now.Bloom has practised law all her adult life, save for a decade when she worked as a legal analyst on TV, and says even she has been stunned by the scale of the Epstein case. I ask her what she thinks of the conspiracy theories that surround it – for instance, the speculation that he was killed in prison, by powerful people who feared guilt by association. “I’m not generally a conspiracy theorist, but in this case there are so many shocking things that we know happened, such as Prince Andrew going to visit him for four days after he was convicted. This is a guy who was getting three girls a day trafficked to him, according to some witnesses. Really, anything’s possible at this point,” Bloom says.This should be a triumphant moment in Bloom’s career. During the 2016 election, she represented two women, Jill Harth and Lisa Boyne, who accused Trump of sexual misconduct, and though the cases never went to trial, Bloom was considered to be working at the forefront of the #MeToo movement. But in 2017, her reputation was completely upended when it emerged that she had been working for Harvey Weinstein. At the time, Bloom insisted she had been merely working as an “adviser”, telling an interviewer that, “My job was to educate him about… what is appropriate and not appropriate in the workplace, including his tone.” When asked if she had been trying to dig up dirt on the actress Rose McGowan, one of Weinstein’s accusers, Bloom replied, “I was not.”But in September this year, two books came out that cast serious doubt on Bloom’s claims. The New York Times reporters who first broke the Weinstein story, Megan Twohey and Jodi Kantor, published their book about the case, She Said. Ronan Farrow, who reported on Weinstein for the New Yorker, then published his account, Catch And Kill. Both books describe Bloom’s relationship with Weinstein in jaw-droppingly damning detail. In She Said, Twohey finds a memo from Bloom to Weinstein written in December 2016, when the film producer first retained her. Also copied into the memo were two private investigators, Jack Palladino and Sara Ness. Bloom shared her thoughts about McGowan, who, in 1997, had received a $100,000 settlement from Weinstein, and in 2016 tweeted that she’d been raped by “a studio head”.“Harvey,” Bloom wrote. “It was a treat to speak with you today, though yes, we’d all prefer better circumstances. I’ve spent the rest of the day reading Jack and Sara’s thorough reports about Rose, who truly comes across as a disturbed, pathological liar, and also your former assistant… who seems to be less of a concern…“I feel equipped to help you against the Roses of the world, because I have represented so many of them. They start out as impressive, bold women, but the more one presses for evidence, the weaknesses and lies are revealed… Clearly she must be stopped in her ridiculous, defamatory attacks on you.”There seems to be a contradiction between your public and private statements about the relationship with Weinstein, I say.Bloom looks down for a beat. When she speaks, her voice is more hesitant.“All I can tell you, in regards to that memo, is virtually none of those things happened,” she says, as though the fact her suggestions weren’t taken up is even close to the point. “There is so much I would love to say about this, and unfortunately I have got strict instructions in writing from Weinstein’s current attorneys that I may not speak about the case. So if I seem like I’m being careful, that’s why. I don’t feel I can even confirm or deny that I wrote that memo. Also Rose McGowan is suing me, so that’s another reason why I really can’t talk about it.“But everything in that memo, if I did say it, I certainly don’t believe now. I was talking about one person – Rose McGowan, not women in general. At the time that I signed on to help Harvey Weinstein, which was in 2016, not a single woman had gone on the record with credible claims against him. Rose McGowan had hinted at it, and that was the concern.” As far as Bloom knew, she says, the allegations against Weinstein were solely about sexual harassment, not sexual assault.But this doesn’t ring true, I tell her. In 2015, the model Ambra Battilana Gutierrez had filed a police report complaining that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her, and recorded him attempting to grope her.“OK, so Ambra, yes. But with Ambra, the Manhattan district attorney had investigated her claim and decided not to pursue it. So at the time I thought, OK, she’s been deemed not to be credible, so I just sort of put it to one side,” Bloom says. “The Dalai Lama said, ‘When you lose, don’t lose the lesson.’ That’s something I’ve always tried to live by. So what’s the lesson? Someone can be lacking in credibility and still also be telling the truth. That was not obvious to me at the time – it is obvious to me now. Also, if multiple women are making claims, even if they’re discounted, surely this is something that has to be taken very seriously.”I find it hard to believe that someone with Bloom’s experience in this area would not know that predators often deliberately go after women who are lacking in credibility, precisely because their complaints will not be believed. And did it really take her until her mid-50s to learn that multiple allegations are a warning sign?Part of the problem, Bloom thinks, was that as an attorney she had learned to compartmentalise allegations, as a way of ascertaining their legal gravity. She was too focused on the details to see the human whole. “So I thought, OK, it’s not anybody who’s his direct employee who’s accusing him, it’s not direct assault.”This would be more credible if she didn’t reference allegations from Weinstein’s “former assistant” in her original memo. Moreover, two former employees, Emily Nestor and Lauren O’Connor, had already provided written accounts of Weinstein’s assaults and harassment, which were widely known within the company.“Well, I was not aware of that,” Bloom says. She insists that she carefully vetted Weinstein before agreeing to be part of his team. “I researched and read every single thing that was publicly available and that I could get my hands on. I spoke to him at length in person and by phone, and spoke to folks who knew him and worked for him,” she says. But Weinstein’s tendency towards sexual predation was so well known within the industry that Tina Fey’s sitcom 30 Rock joked about it in 2012, and Courtney Love referenced it on the red carpet in 2005 (“If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don’t go.”). So perhaps Bloom needs to refine her vetting system. “Am I perfect at doing this? No,” she agrees.Even some Weinstein company board members criticised Bloom for defending him too aggressively. In October 2017, Twohey and Kantor revealed in the New York Times that they had seen emails from Bloom to the board in which she outlined a plan to defend Weinstein that involved “photos of several of the accusers in very friendly poses with Harvey after his alleged misconduct”. Board member Lance Maerov wrote that “publishing pictures of victims in friendly poses with Harvey will backfire as it suggests they are exculpatory”, and told Bloom she was “fanning the flames and compounding the problem”. Maerov also pointed out a conflict of interest: the Weinstein Company was planning to make a TV series of Bloom’s book, Suspicion Nation, about the Trayvon Martin case. (Bloom was not involved in the case, but writes about it like the legal pundit she once was, explaining the trial and criticising the prosecution.) “How can you possibly provide impartial advice to Harvey or address this group with any credibility?” Maerov wrote.Bob Weinstein added: “It is my opinion, that u are giving your client poor counsel. Perhaps Harvey as he stated in the NY Times, to the world, should get professional help for a problem that really exists.”When I bring this up, Bloom looks more irritated than pained, and if her previous tactic was warmth and approachability, it now switches into the more common lawyerly pose of slipperiness and hair-splitting. I ask about her suggestion of finding photos of Weinstein with his accusers in “friendly poses”.“I didn’t suggest finding photos. There are photos that are out there. So I don’t know what that means about finding them,” she says sharply.It presumably means placing them in the press.“Well, there were newspapers that had them. I think what I said was, ‘There are photos that are going to run.’”I start to read her the New York Times article but she talks over me: “Listen, people are so taken with this issue, but when taking a case, you have to look at all of the evidence, including photos. I don’t think I ever suggested that one photo tells the entire story – but it is always part of the story.”In other words, Bloom is saying that the photos were just a way of educating herself about Weinstein. She has also used this argument in relation to Farrow. In Catch And Kill, Farrow writes that he first contacted Bloom because she had previously supported his sister, Dylan, who has long accused their father, Woody Allen, of molesting her as a child – an allegation he denies. (Bloom had also appeared on Farrow’s TV show, talking about how the rich and powerful protect themselves. “The first thing they do is go on the attack against the victim, try to dredge up anything from her life they can find to embarrass her,” Bloom said.) Once Farrow began investigating Weinstein, he asked her for advice, and to keep it confidential. “You have my word,” she replied.According to Farrow, Bloom then suggested that he meet with Weinstein, saying she knew the producer “a little”. Farrow declined, but his book is punctuated with subsequent calls from Bloom (“‘Hey!’ she said brightly…”), in which she asked what further information he had on the case. In the summer of 2017, Farrow expressed his astonishment that she had – as he had learned – been passing on information to Weinstein’s people.“Ronan,” she replied. “I am his people.’”Did she misrepresent her relationship with Weinstein in their initial conversations?He believes you were calling him to find out what he knew, in order to relay that to Weinstein.“I don’t think it’s fair to assume,” she says with a laugh.Bloom stepped down from the Weinstein case in October 2017, shortly after the full allegations were published in the New York Times. On The View a month later, she tearfully conceded that she had been “so excited” about her book deal that “it clouded my judgment”. In our conversation, it is also clear that she was starstruck. “I thought, ‘What a great opportunity to work with this film producer who the Obamas love,’” she says, also citing Weinstein’s friendships with Hillary Clinton, Michael Moore and Gloria Steinem. “So I thought, ‘OK, this is a good guy,’” she says. The money, presumably, was another inducement: according to She Said, Bloom was charging Weinstein $895 an hour, plus a $50,000 retainer.Lisa Bloom was born in Philadelphia and largely raised in Los Angeles, the only child of a single mother. Allred was only 20 when her daughter was born, and her marriage to Bloom’s father, Peyton Bray, was short and fraught: she left him when his mental illness tipped over into physical violence. Bray, who was diagnosed as bipolar, later killed himself. Shortly afterwards, Allred went on holiday with a girlfriend and was raped at gunpoint. She never went to the police, assuming she wouldn’t be believed. But when she decided to become a lawyer a few years later, her experience undoubtedly played a part in her decision to focus on female victims of domestic and sexual violence.The personal has also played a part in Bloom’s professional life. She went into law to defend abused children, because she was once one herself. Between the ages of 11 and 15, she was, she tells me, abused by a close relative.Did she ever take legal steps against him?“I never reported him to the police. I was an emotional wreck and suicidal as a teen and into my 20s, because of the years of unrelenting abuse. I was in no position to take legal action. By the time I got emotionally healthy and strong enough to do it in my late 20s, the statute of limitations, every paedophile’s get-out-of-jail-free card, had expired,” she says.She told her mother about the abuse when she was 18. How did Allred react? There is a pause. “I don’t like to talk about my mother in this story, because I feel she’s the best person to talk about her experience,” Bloom says.Bloom’s mother was once mocked for her numerous media appearances but is now revered as a feminist groundbreaker. Allred pioneered a new legal approach, using the media to defend women and minorities, often by acting as a kind of publicist for them. During the OJ Simpson trial, when Simpson’s lawyers tried to make the case about everything but the actual murders, Allred was hired by the family of Simpson’s wife, Nicole Brown. She became a ubiquitous TV presence, reminding the public of the victims: Brown and Ron Goldman. “If it hadn’t been for Gloria, Nicole would always have been just that person on a gurney,” Brown’s sister, Denise, says in Seeing Allred, the 2018 Netflix documentary.In the same online biography, Bloom emphasises repeatedly that she has rejected “Big Law’s big bucks” in order to fight for civil rights. But she is certainly earning a lot now, I say.“People forget that I have a business. Let’s say that I have a case and we get $1m in the case, and let’s say that we get a third of that. That does not go into my pocket – it goes to the company to pay salaries. People will say, ‘Lisa Bloom took a third!’ But I believe that I should be paid for my work,” she says.“I would have preferred a phone call,” Bloom says with a light laugh.While her mother has tended to use publicity as a means to an end, Bloom appears more dazzled by celebrity, to the extent that in 2016, it became the end. In Seeing Allred, CNN’s Don Lemon, who has interviewed both women on his show, says, “Both of them have been advocates for victims’ rights, but Gloria had to do it in a much tougher time than Lisa is having to do it now. So it’s interesting to watch how they both deal with it, a generation apart.” Allred knows you can never give an inch, because then you lose everything. Bloom has given more than an inch.I ask Bloom if she and her mother have made up since the criticism over Weinstein. She shrugs off the question as if it were as insignificant as a fly: “We had a little rift, but we’re both tough people. It’s water under the bridge,” she says.After Bloom resigned from the Weinstein case, she flew to Houston to advise a victim of domestic violence. “And I asked her, ‘Is all the Harvey Weinstein coverage affecting you?’ And she said, ‘Harvey who?’” Bloom says.She insists that she hasn’t lost any clients as a result of playing for the other side. On the contrary, she says, her firm has almost doubled in size since 2017. The revelations in She Said and Catch And Kill seemed career-ending, but Bloom is dealing with them like a lawyer: head on and with a certain amount of slipperiness. For now she is focused on the Epstein case and maybe, in time, if she does enough high-profile cases in the same area, they will drive down all the Google references to her alliance with Weinstein. She has vowed never again to defend anyone accused of sexual misconduct, focusing instead on the victims.Two years since #MeToo gathered steam, I ask if she thinks we are seeing real systemic change, or merely a rearrangement of deckchairs. “I think we’re seeing some change, but not nearly enough. In every one of my cases I still get asked about the same myths: why didn’t she report it earlier? What about these inconsistent statements?” she says, with no apparent irony.Bloom might have proved a figurehead of the #MeToo movement instead, she is considered one of its villains. Of course, she says, she deeply regrets working for Weinstein. This “colossal mistake”, as she refers to it, has spiked all her achievements with accusations of cynicism and hypocrisy. It’s hard to be the change when you have worked to perpetuate the problem.“I hope I treat all of my clients with compassion,” she says with emotion. And I’m sure she does, even if she occasionally thinks of them as “the Roses of the world” presumably she can now reassure them that she has worked with “the Harveys of the world”. After all, David Boies, another high-profile lawyer who formerly worked for Weinstein, is now representing Virginia Giuffre. “Attorneys represent a lot of distasteful people, and attorneys and clients are different people,” says Bloom.

Days earlier, the North said it had conducted a “very important test” at the site, on the country’s north-western coast, prompting speculation that it involved a new engine for either an ICBM or a space launch vehicle.The announcement suggests that the country is preparing to do something to provoke the US if Washington does not back down and make concessions to ease sanctions and pressure on Pyongyang in deadlocked nuclear negotiations.An unnamed spokesman for the academy said scientists received warm congratulations from members from the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea central committee which attended the test, carried out between 10.41 pm and 10.48pm on Friday at the Sohae satellite launching ground, where the North has conducted satellite launches and liquid-fuel missile engine tests in recent years.The spokesman said the successful outcome of the latest test, in addition to one on 7 December, would be applied “to further bolster up the reliable strategic nuclear deterrent of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”, referring to North Korea’s formal name.Kim Dong-yub, a former South Korean military officer and an analyst at Seoul’s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the North mentioning its nuclear deterrent made it clear it had tested a new engine for an ICBM, not a satellite-launch vehicle. Kim said it was notable that North Korea announced the specific length of the test, which he said possibly signalled a larger, liquid-fuel ICBM engine.North Korea’s current ICBMs, including the Hwasong-15, are built with first stages powered by a pair of engines that experts say are modelled after Russian designs. When the North first tested the engine in 2016, it said the test lasted for 200 seconds and demonstrated a thrust of 80 tons-force.During a provocative run of weapons tests in 2017, Kim Jong-un conducted three flight tests of ICBMs that demonstrated potential range to reach deep into the US mainland, raising tensions and triggering verbal warfare with Donald Trump as they exchanged crude insults and threats of nuclear annihilation. Experts say the North still needs to improve the missiles, such as ensuring that their warheads survive the harsh conditions of atmospheric re-entry, for them to be considered a viable threat.Relations between Kim and Trump thawed in 2018 after Kim initiated diplomacy that led to their first summit in June that year in Singapore, where they issued a vague statement on a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, without describing when or how it would occur.Negotiations faltered after the US rejected North Korean demands for broad sanctions relief, in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities, at Kim’s second summit with Trump, in Vietnam, in February.Trump and Kim met for a third time in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. However, an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what Pyongyang described as Washington’s “old stance and attitude”.Kim, who unilaterally suspended nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests last year during talks with Washington and Seoul, has said North Korea could seek a “new path” if the US persisted with sanctions and pressure against the North.North Korea has also conducted 13 rounds of ballistic missile and rocket artillery tests since May, and has hinted at lifting its moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests if the Trump administration failed to make substantial concessions before the new year.Some experts doubt that Kim would revive the tensions of 2017 by restarting nuclear and ICBM tests, which would cross a metaphorical “red line” and risk shattering his hard-won diplomacy with Washington. They say Kim is likely to pressurise Trump with military activities that pose less of a direct threat to the US and by bolstering a united front with Beijing and Moscow. Both are the North’s allies and have called for the UN security council to consider easing sanctions on Pyongyang to help nuclear negotiations move forward."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4114663.1576255332!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar says bare bones trade deal may replace no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar  in Brussels on Friday. The Taoiseach said Boris Johnson had a ‘very strong personal mandate. . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.’ Photograph:  Kenzo TribouillardAFP via Getty ImagesTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said a “bare bones” trade agreement between the EU and the UK may be possible late next year if a full trade agreement cannot be negotiated in time, as most EU leaders expect.EU leaders attending the summit in Brussels acknowledged that the UK would now leave the EU in January, but most do not believe a trade agreement can be agreed before the transition period ends next December – raising the prospect of another “cliff edge” in 12 months’ time.However, speaking to journalists after the conclusion of the summit, Mr Varadkar said it “may be possible to put together some kind of bare bones agreement to cover some aspects of it”.He said this would “not be ‘no deal’ in the sense that we used to talk about no deal” because of the guarantees in the withdrawal agreement.Earlier, Mr Varadkar warned against moves towards a united Ireland in the wake of Northern Ireland result, which saw unionist losses and gains for nationalists and the Alliance Party.Mr Varadkar said while the “tectonic plates” were shifting in the North, the focus should be reviving the powersharing institutions, rather than pushing for a united Ireland.PowersharingHe said there was now “no unionist majority, no nationalist majority and an ever-expanding centre ground”.He added: “The one thing that hasn’t changed for Northern Ireland is that the best future for Northern Ireland is one based on powersharing and one based on reconciliation, one based on bringing all communities together. And the next step in that has to be getting the Executive and Assembly up and running before January 13th.”On Brexit, Mr Varadkar said that he agreed with French president Emmanuel Macron who told the council meeting there should be “no quotas, no tariffs and no dumping” – referring to the need for the UK to uphold European standards of worker protection and product standards if it was to benefit from open access to the European market.“That’s the kind of space we’re in as the European Union,” Mr Varadkar said.Asked “which Boris will turn up” at talks, Mr Varadkar said he had met Mr Johnson on a few occasions and they had spoken a lot on the phone “but I certainly can’t read his mind, nor do I know his mind”. “But if I had to guess, I think he is somebody who is an economic and social liberal. And he’s somebody who is going to want to have a close relationship with the European Union, and will want us to have a trade deal as close and also a future relationship that goes beyond trade into an economic partnership, citizens rights and also a political partnership too. But that all remains to be seen.”He added that Mr Johnson had a “very strong personal mandate . . . It’s up to him to decide how he wants to use it.”‘Absolute caveat’Mr Varadkar said Ireland would be an advocate in Europe for the UK to have a close economic and political relationship with the EU – “but with the absolute caveat that it can never undermine the European Union”.“We’re in a different place and we’re in a more vulnerable place in a lot of ways, so we need to maintain our place at the centre of the European Union – but also we need to maintain a close relationship with our nearest neighbour. So that’s going to be a challenge, but I think it’s one we can navigate,” he said. Mr Varadkar said EU leaders in their private discussions had stressed the importance of maintaining unity among the EU member states behind chef negotiator Michel Barnier’s task force.The Taoiseach said that would be difficult because the interests of EU countries would erge in the trade talks. “So we need to stick together and we need to maintain solidarity and unity, and that’s what we intend to do.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4115776.1576327921!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"varadkar way to investigate dara murphy s attendance must be found","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar pictured on the RTÉ Radio 1’s Marian Finucane Show with Brendan O’Connor. Photograph: Andres PovedaRTÉTaoiseach Leo Varadkar has said an independent person may be appointed to investigated Dara Murphy’s Dáil attendance record and expenses.“That’s something that isn’t entirely under my control if he was still a member of the house he could be investigated by the house ethics committee, apparently because he isn’t a member of the house, that can’t be done.”“We need to find an alternative option, we might be able to appoint an independent person to examine it,” he said.Mr Murphy has been criticised for claiming full parliamentary and travel allowances of €4,300 per month despite spending much of the last two years working in Brussels as campaign manager for the European People’s Party (EPP), the centre-right grouping to which Fine Gael is aligned.Mr Murphy resigned as a TD on December 3rd, hours after the Government won a no-confidence vote in Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy.The former Cork North Central TD has taken up a new full-time post as deputy head of cabinet for Bulgarian EU commissioner Mariya Gabriel in December.The datelines of Mr Murphy’s tweets suggest he was in locations such as Malta, Warsaw, Brussels and Paris on days he signed in on the Dáil electronic fobbing system.This suggests he recorded his attendance on the fobbing system either after flying back from or before flying out to those destinations.Speaking on Saturday, Mr Varadkar said although he had been aware Mr Murphy had taken up a new role as campaign manager for the EPP, he did not officially sanction it.Mr Varadkar said “if it’s found he’s broken the rules, he should pay the money back”.Mr Varadkar also said Mr Murphy was not at the bottom of the list when it came to turning up for votes.Sincere apology The Taoiseach also criticised a controversial campaign video released by Verona Murphy, the Fine Gael candidate in last month’s Wexford by-election, which suggested she had been the victim of a campaign of character assassination by the media.Ms Murphy made, and then withdrew and apologised for, comments about asylum seekers being linked to Islamic State and suggested they may need “de-programming”.Asked why he had canvassed with Ms Murphy following these comments, Mr Varadkar said she had apologised and withdrawn them.However, he added: “What was done subsequently in terms of the video she did which sort of tried to imply the whole thing was a media character assassination attempt on her - I had a big problem with that because maybe it suggested to me that the apology and retraction wasn’t fully sincere.” He said Ms Murphy had been vetted prior to her selection as a candidate and would have had mock media interviews where questions on issues like direct provision would have been asked “and that wasn’t the answer given”.He said her future in the party was not yet decided and that a process would be followed, but added that lapses in ethical standards in Fine Gael had been punished before by removal from the ticket.Brexit The Taoiseach said he spoke to the recently re-elected UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, by phone Friday night, and the pair agreed that talks on the future of the Stormont executive should be restarted next week with a view to having an executive and assembly in place by the end of January.He said Mr Johnson is “is the guy you see on TV, witty and intelligent, on occasion a little bit eccentric, but somebody who at least so far is someone I felt I could meet and deal with and has been honourable in any agreements we have come to or any understandings we had”. The Taoiseach said he believed Brexit would happen on January 31st, and said the European Union would seek a close relationship with the UK, albeit not one that could lead to standards being undermined.“We must have common minimum standards . . . we’re not going to agree to that if you’re going to try and undercut us on health and safety, on labour rights, on environmental protections,” he said.He said now is not the time for a Border poll. “I think that’s the wrong approach now for Norther Ireland given there is not a nationalist majority in Northern Ireland . . . It would probably be defeated, it would probably be very isive.” Instead, he argued that all parties should recommit to the Belfast Agreement."},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons december 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178.Amazon deforestation hits new high according to latest official figuresGeneral election 2019: Boris Johnson tells new Tory MPs in Labour heartlands they are \u0026#39servants of the people\u0026#39Corbyn\u0026#39s humiliating defeat is \u0026#39canary in the coal mine\u0026#39 for Democrats warns Mike BloombergNew Yeoman Gaoler at Tower of London as ex-airman hangs up axe after leading Beefeaters for over a decadeMatteo Salvini wades into culture wars as populist is chased around Italy by \u0026#39sardines\u0026#39Comment: This is the government to get Britain moving after three and a half years of lost timeVictory for makers of \u0026#39veggie burgers\u0026#39 as federal court blocks strict labelling law Wigan \u0026#39double stabbing\u0026#39: Two women injured in attackUnesco kicks Belgian festival off culture list for anti-SemitismFinnish minister polls Instagram users on fate of Isil women and childrenBoris Johnson warned by Brexiteers not to back down on Brexit deadlinesVoters in Labour\u0026#39s shattered \u0026#39red wall\u0026#39 hold Johnson to his \u0026#39Get Brexit Done\u0026#39 promiseBody of 21-year-old vet recovered from volcano island as family fight for survival in hospitalComment: A great victory for Red Toryism – but Boris can\u0026#39t take his new voters for grantedComment: The arrogance and detachment of Corbyn’s middle class fan club was a factor in every seat Labour lostComment: Labour cannot reclaim itself as an electoral force until it gets to the root of its antisemitism issuesBoris Johnson will cave in to IndyRef2 as he cannot \u0026#39imprison\u0026#39 Scotland, claims Nicola SturgeonComment: The pollsters were under the spotlight this election, and they performedWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2019/12/13/10/apple-iphone-11-camera.jpg","title":"apple spectral edge iphone camera 2020","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Future devices could feature vastly improved photo technology thanks to ‘secret sauce’Apple has acquired UK-based photography startup Spectral Edge, whose technology could soon find its way into the cameras of new iPhones.Details of the buyout are yet to be revealed by either company, though filings at Companies House show that the Cupertino company now controls the Cambridge startup.The filings, first reported by\u0026nbspBloomberg, also revealed that Apple corporate lawyer Peter Denwood\u0026nbsphas been named director of the startup.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSpectral Edge’s website, as well as all of its social media accounts, have also been taken down.Neither Apple nor Spectral Edge responded to a request for comment.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

There’s been other techniques to combine the two in the past but they don’t end up with pictures that are nice to look at.”Spectral Edge is the second acquisition of a UK startup\u0026nbspfor Apple this year, following the takeover of digital marketing startup DataTiger\u0026nbspin February.The technology giant will be hoping the latest buyout can offer a critical edge over competitors when it comes to camera performance, which has become one of the key differentiators between high-end smartphones in recent years.Apple is not expected to release a new iPhone until September 2020, meaning there is plenty of time to integrate Spectral Edge’s technology into its devices.\u0026nbspBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After crashing back down to $175, it then went on another positive run in 2017 that took it close to $20,000 by the end of that year.\u0026nbspSharing the full story, not just the headlinesSince then, bitcoin has tumbled once more, reaching below $4,000 at the start of 2019 before recovering to today’s price of around $7,000. (At the time of his arrest six years ago, the FBI seized 144,000 bitcoins from Silk Road and\u0026nbspUlbricht\u0026nbsp- worth just over $1 billion at current prices.)Ulbricht\u0026nbspclaims he predicted both of these waves from his prison cell and believes another one is already building – a prediction he says he is able to make without being swayed by day-to-day price movements and general market hubris his imprisonment shelters him from.Created with Sketch.Bitcoin\u0027s volatile history in pictures Show all 8Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.18 Satoshi Nakamoto creates the first bitcoin block in 2009On 3 January, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin appeared.

This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearIn a six-part blog published from letters he wrote in\u0026nbspprison, Ulbricht\u0026nbspapplied a form of market analysis known as Elliott Wave Theory to predict new all-time highs for bitcoin.The theory forecasts the highs and lows in financial market cycles by identifying extremes in investor psychology, which in the case of bitcoin appear to be far more tempormental compared to traditional markets due to the nacency of the cryptocurrency.The principle posits that price movements in speculative markets are driven by investor expectation, which when combined with mass psychology can force prices artificially higher through a positive feedback loop of buyer optimism.Looking at the previous price waves of bitcoin, Ulbricht puts the next big wave reaching between $93,000 and $109,000 before the 17 February, 2021. He notes that his speculation should be considered with appropriate scepticism.“We have a price target... of ~$100,000 some time in or near 2020,” he wrote. “However, there is no rule that market moves have to be proportional. This is just a patter we see unfolding that may or may not continue.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The pub chain owner and prominent Brexit supporter saw the value of his stake in the pub chain jump almost 10 per cent from £487m to £531m.Mr Martin had backed the Brexit Party, which failed to secure a single seat, but he will likely be pleased with the result in any case after a Tory landslide prompted Wetherspoon shares to rise from\u0026nbsp1,482p to 1,619p.Boris Johnson’s decisive win boosted the pound and sent shares in a number of UK companies soaring\u0026nbspon the hopes that uncertainty around Brexit will now fade away.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesMr Martin has been one of the few business leaders to vocally back leaving the EU. He spent £94,856 on pro-Brexit beer mats and\u0026nbsphas regularly used the pub group’s magazine to promote the benefits of leaving.The company’s updates to the stock market have also been used as a platform to rail at EU rules and bureaucracy.Created with Sketch.General election 2019: How the night unfolded Show all 27Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.227 11.28pm - First result to be announcedLabour holds Newcastle Central, albeit with a reduced majority, in the first result to be announced in the 2019 General ElectionThe Conservatives gain Blyth Valley, in the North East, from Labour in the first big upset of the night.

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Do you understand what self-deprecation means when it comes from somebody who already exists in the margins? It’s not humility, it\u0027s humiliation. I put myself down in order to speak, in order to seek permission to speak, and I simply will not do that anymore. Not to myself or anybody who identifies with me.”If you liked Ali Wong in Always Be My Maybe (which she co-wrote!), then you’re going to love her in Hard Knock Wife (her second Netflix special and a follow-up on her 2016 debut Baby Cobra). Her unapologetic takes on motherhood and marriage (did you know she makes a lot more money than her husband and she’s not sorry?) are gold.Standout line: “Now, I make a lot more money than my husband by, like, a long shot. My mom is very concerned that he’s going to leave me out of intimidation. I had to explain to her that the only kind of man who would leave a woman who makes more money… is the kind of man that doesn’t like free money.”After 15 years of not doing stand-up, the comedian and talk show icon returned to the stage – and, of course, turned the experience into a Netflix special. Under the pretence of pondering whether she’s still relatable, Ellen DeGeneres basks in the (well-earned) glory her accomplishments, reflects on her personal experiences – including her 1997 coming-out and how it was received in Hollywood – and riffs on the absurdities of daily life. What a treat.510 Son of Patricia, Trevor NoahTrevor Noah has been starring in comedy specials for a decade, so it’s no surprise that he can take just about any topic (tourism in Bali, trap music, a conversation with President Barack Obama) and turn it into incisive jokes.Katherine Ryan’s second Netflix special (the follow-up to In Trouble, which came out in 2017) tackles some of her trademark topics, from dating to co-parenting, in a lighthearted, self-affirming way. A delight through and through.Back in 2012, Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, was appearing as the unforgettable Troy Barnes in Community – and spared a little time to record a Netflix special, which remains available to this day. Throughout this one-hour show, he shows off his range, reflecting on his music career, reaching his late twenties, and that brief time when the internet really wanted him to play Spider-Man.Standout line: “I lived in Downtown LA, and Downtown LA is kind of like the Eighties decided to stay there. They’re like, ‘Oh, OK, you guys go ahead and be the Nineties. Go enjoy Ace of Base – we’ll be here practicing the Moonwalk and selling crack.’”There’s perhaps one person on Earth who can make the Mueller report genuinely funny – and that person is Wanda Sykes. The comedian might be best known for her roles on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Black-ish, but her stand-up is well worth a watch. She has impeccable timing, sharp writing, and an apparently effortless ability to connect with her crowd.Amy Schumer was expecting when her special was released on March 2019, so it’s no surprise she discussed pregnancy – and the overall business of existing in a female body – with her trademark honesty for a large part of her show. This special is actually made up of two shows, Dark and Jigsaw. The Scottish comedian refreshes the “fish out of water” archetype by delivering his take on the US – and that time he told a joke about being an atheist in Indiana. His smart writing enables him to tackle topics, such as disability and – yes – paedophilia, in a way few comics could pull off.Standout line: “As a parent – no, I’m not a parent, but I like speaking for other people, because I’m white, middle-class and male, and that’s what my people do.”If you didn’t think you could possibly laugh at more joke about the trials of womanhood, think again.

It predicts that this proportion could rise to between 12 and 20 per cent over the next decade as younger people join the workforce.The 29-page guide advises staff to cut out unnecessary gendered language and provides advice on how to ask someone which pronouns they prefer when describing\u0026nbspthemselves.It suggests providing all-gender facilities, promoting visible trans and non-binary role models and ensuring forms do not only include options for two genders.“It is much simpler to refer to someone as Hilary, than ‘she’ or ‘he’, and this can avoid worries over mis-gendering,” the guide states.Managers are advised to demonstrate their commitment to inclusion by personally taking action such as adding their pronouns to their email signatures.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I said that I identified as non-binary and told people that I was saying it for the first time and everyone applauded, which was heart-warming. Then nothing really happened, apart from a few people, who said ‘well done’. It was all very low-key and remains so.”In the foreword, Mr McKenna-Coles wrote that Lloyd’s has “room for further development” on trans and non-binary inclusion.“One of the secondary threads of our research was confusion and lack of knowledge on behalf of managers and colleagues over how to handle the situation, and, with the best intentions in the world, how to make it all ‘work right’ for all parties,” he wrote.City employers are taking note of the fact that increasing ersity and inclusion is good policy and good for business.Firms in the top quartile for ersity were 21 per cent more likely to have above-average profitability than those in the bottom quartile, a study by\u0026nbspMcKinsey\u0026nbspfound last year.Lloyds of London\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The Trust has repeatedly criticised the five-week delay in first receiving benefits when people are moved onto the Universal Credit system in particular.When the Foodbank app was launched in 2014 it said 40 local foodbanks had signed up to take part, but it is not clear how many are using it today.The Foodbank app is not the only similar service available to local charities, and nor is it the only service which charges inidual foodbanks.Any foodbank which joins the Trussell Trust’s own network has to pay a joining fee of £1,500 and then £360 a year after that.The Trust says this helps towards the costs of delivering their services to foodbanks, including £1.3m-worth of funding in 2018.Ms Cates\u0026nbspand the Conservative Party did not respond to requests for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But the Greens will only have one MP in\u0026nbspCaroline Lucas, while\u0026nbspNigel Farage’s party did not win a single seat.Switching to a party list PR system would have huge consequences for the\u0026nbspSNP. The analysis shows\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon’s party would have only won 28 seats, rather than the 48 the Scottish nationalists claimed.“Westminster’s system is built on confrontation and warped results, but we can do better than this,” said Mr Hughes. We can move to a fairer system, restoring trust in politics and building a better democracy at the same time.”Election analysis also shows more than half of voters backed pro-referendum parties at the polls.Nearly 52 per cent supported parties in favour of a second referendum, compared with 47 per cent who supported Brexit-backing parties, such as the Tories, the DUP and Mr Farage’s outfit.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen indicated that an agreement to be reached within Mr Johnson’s\u0026nbspdeadline of 31 December 2020 can only cover areas like goods, fisheries and security, with the vital services sector to be dealt with later.And the TUC warned that Mr Johnson must be ready to take his time to secure a deal which will support jobs and workplace protections in the northern and midlands seats which secured his stunning victory over Labour. The PM was carrying out post-election visits in the north on Saturday to assure voters of his determination to spread opportunity across the UK.Created with Sketch.

It will be 20 years or something before the thing is once again raised as an issue.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He said before the election that he wants to protect and enhance employment rights, but if you look at that withdrawal bill, it delivers none of those protections.”He added: “The government needs to now widen the conversation to include businesses, to include trade unions.“And I think our message clearly to Boris Johnson would be to put people before politics, to deliver a Brexit deal that does protect jobs and employment rights and I think that means getting a right deal not just a quick deal – and I think it does mean standing by the commitments he’s made to those voters in the northeast and in the midlands who may have voted for the first time.”Mr Nowak warned: “A deal that threatens jobs and people’s employment isn’t a deal that we can live with.”Belgian MEP Philippe Lamberts, a member of the European parliament’s Brexit Steering Group, said that a trade deal with zero tariffs would depend on whether the Conservative Party was able to “face up to its own contradictions”.Mr Lamberts said: “They want the deepest possible access to the European single market, yet they want to undercut significantly EU legislation, and you can’t have both.“So either you want total regulatory freedom and you do whatever you like – and if you want to undercut EU legislation then you do it, but then you lose access. Or you want access and you have basically to remain aligned with EU legislation, that will be the decision that Boris Johnson will need to make.”He added: “If the United Kingdom wants to retain full access, including for services, that will have the adverse consequence that it has to remain aligned to EU legislation in services as well, and I understand that some in the government would want to deviate from that quite significantly.”Mr Farage admitted that the influence on the prime minister of his Brexit Party and the European Research Group of backbench Tory Eurosceptics has “disappeared for the time being” as a result of Mr Johnson’s overwhelming victory.But he vowed to be “not too far away from the action” as the UK’s new relationship with the EU takes shape.Writing in The Daily , the architect of Brexit said: “Questions over the future shape of Brexit and Britain’s place in the world are now entirely in the hands of Johnson.“With half of his cabinet having voted Remain, and substantial global pressures on him, it will be tempting for him to pursue the easy option of a soft Brexit.“Whatever happens over the coming months, I will make sure I am not too far away from the action. The fact is that if Brexit does not ‘get done’, as Johnson has promised repeatedly over the last six weeks, pressure will have to be reapplied.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Wetherspoon\u0026nbsphas doubled in value since then,\u0026nbspadding more than £250m\u0026nbspto Mr Martin’s personal wealth.Earlier this week, Wetherspoon\u0026nbspalso announced plans to invest more than £200m in pubs and hotels over the next four years, creating around 10,000 jobs.New pubs and hotels will be opened, and existing pubs across the UK and Republic of Ireland will be enlarged.Most of the investment will be channelled into developments in small and medium-sized towns, but will also include larger towns and cities.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After six years abroad, Saleh returned to her home country when people took to the streets demanding change. She was at a sit-in near the defence ministry in Khartoum on 3 June when security forces stormed the site. The area had become a centre for anti-government protests. Saleh said she was beaten with sticks, and still wears bandages on her wounds. ‘I came back from a safer place because I want a better future for this country,’ she said.

On 3 June, members of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces shouted at her and other protesters and told them to run, she said. ‘We ran. We were surrounded by soldiers and policemen,’ she said. Both her arms are now wrapped in bandages. ‘While we were running, they beat us. To protect my head, I used my hands.

Mr Steele told the Louisville Courier-Journal, which first reported the controversial pardoning. Two other men also convicted of involvement in the same death as Baker remain in prison.Mr Bevin wrote in the official order announcing Baker’s pardon that the evidence used to convict him was “sketchy at best”.He had made a “series of unwise decisions in his adult life”, Mr Bevin added, suggesting a drug problem had led to Baker falling in with the wrong crowd.Zombie TV shows among causes of mass shootings, Republican saysBut the judge who sentenced Baker in 2017, David Williams, said he had never seen a more “compelling or complete” case in his thirty years of experience. “The evidence was just overwhelming.”Mr Steele told the newspaper he believed the only reason Mr Bevin issued the pardon while leaving the two co-conspirators in prison was because Baker’s family had donated money to the governor. \u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He also pardoned a man convicted of beheading a woman, a child rapist, a man who hired a hitman to murder his business partner in front of his family, and a woman who dumped her new-born child in a toilet septic tank.Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has condemned his fellow Republican. “Honestly, I don’t approve. It seems to me it was completely inappropriate,” Mr McConnell said when questioned by reporters about the slew of controversial pardons.“I expect he had the power to do it, but looking at the examples of people who were incarcerated as a result of heinous crimes — no, I don’t approve of it.”“What this governor did is an absolute atrocity of justice,” said Mr Steele. “He’s put victims, he’s put others in our community in danger.”Several senior Kentucky Democratic politicians have already written to the state’s incoming attorney general demanding a bipartisan special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the governor’s actions, and in particular the pardon for Baker.In response to the controversy, Mr Bevin told the Washington Post he was a “big believer in second chances”.“I think this is a nation that was founded on the concept of redemption and second chances and new pages in life.“If there has been a change and there’s no further value that comes for the inidual, for society, for the victims, for anybody, if a person continues to stay in, then that’s when somebody should be considered for a commutation or a pardon.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Abduweli Ayup, a Uighur linguist in exile, said his wife\u0027s relatives in Xinjiang - including her parents, siblings, and in-laws - were detained shortly after the leaks were published, claiming\u0026nbspthey had no relation to the leaks as far as he was aware.He said some people in touch with relatives outside China were also investigated and seized.It is unknown how many have been detained since the leaks.I risked my life getting my parents out of a Uighur detention camp China\u0027s brutal treatment of the Uighurs has now been laid bareUK joins 22 other UN nations condemning China’s detention of MuslimsEarlier this week, a Uighur woman in the Netherlands told\u0026nbspde Volkskrant, a Dutch daily, that she was the source of the documents published by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Asiye Abdulaheb said that after she posted one page on social media in June, Chinese state agents sent her death threats and tried to recruit her ex-husband to spy on her.The leaked documents lay out the Chinese government\u0027s deliberate strategy to lock up ethnic minorities even before they commit a crime\u0026nbspand to rewire their thoughts and the language they speak.They reveal that facilities Beijing calls vocational training schools are forced ideological and behavioural re-education centres run in secret.The papers also show how Beijing is pioneering a new form of social control using data and artificial intelligence. Drawing on data collected by mass surveillance technology, computers issued the names of tens of thousands of people for interrogation or detention in just one week.Last week, the US.House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act, aimed at pressuring China over the mass detentions in Xinjiang.Beijing swiftly denounced the bill as foreign meddling.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required for enrolment. This includes among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes. Foundations like TOMS have given 95 million pairs of shoes to people across 82 countries.Chacha, 12, was born and raised in a small village in northwestern Tanzania, where he lives with his mother and two siblings. He has never set foot in a classroom and is one of a reported 1.89 million out-of-school children in the country today. Chacha works seven days per week scavenging gold mining sites, digging up rocks containing gold-residue. To avoid being captured or shot by mining and government police for trespass, he works under the cover of darkness, 6pm to 6am. The rocks he finds, he sells to middle men, for approximately £1.50 per shift, who crush them to extract the gold. He explained: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my family. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.” The money Chacha earns he uses to purchase clothes for himself and his siblings, the remainder he gives to his mother to contribute to food costs. When he returns home from his 12-hour shift, he tends to the family cattle.Evaline, 11, was enrolled in grade three at Remagwe primary school, when at the age of eight, her father passed away suddenly. In 2018, she returned to school with the help of her teenage sister, who had told her about the EAA-GMT education programme. She lives with her mother, who is a farmer, and her four siblings in a grass thatch house with no mattress. Evaline helps her mother with farming and domestic work. The family survive on two meals per day, usually one meal of soft porridge and another of stiff porridge. She walks about 1.5 hours each way to school, something not uncommon to these children in the hardest to reach areas of northwestern Tanzania. Evaline dreams of becoming a nurse and understands she can achieve her dreams through education. Her role model is Maria, a nurse in the city of Mwanza who originates from her village. Evaline’s message to the world is that they should support all the children to receive education.Often shoes that adhere to a specific dress code are required for students to attend school. In addition to uniforms, books, transportation, other informal fees or the cost of shoes can be a roadblock to enrolment. TOMS Giving Shoes help to reduce families’ financial burden.Jonas, 12, was born in a village situated on the shores of Lake Victoria. He now lives with his father, a fisherman, and his step-mother a farmer. Jonas enrolled into an Educate A Child (EAC) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT) partnership in 2017. GMT conducted a survey reaching out to the community to help identify out-of-school children in the region. The survey identified more than 20,000. Jonas was one of those and set foot into a classroom for the first time at the age of 10. The mandatory age for school enrolment is seven, however his family’s lack of available funds meant he could not enrol into school. Also childhood illnesses, easily treated by relatively inexpensive medicines, meant he spent a huge part of his childhood unwell as his father could not afford treatment. When asked what it was like to take his first steps into a classroom, he replied: “It was incredibly exciting, and now it is even more exciting as there is a good chance I will go to secondary school.”Afya, 14, was enrolled into primary school through the EAC and GMT partnership in 2017, after being identified in the out-of-school children survey. Despite being enrolled in school, poverty still remains her greatest challenge. Her  refuses to contribute to the informal fees or voluntary parental contributions required to continue enrolment.Matteus, nine, in the office of the principal at Remagwe school, looks down while he nervously scratches at the torn and faded zebra-print fabric sofa. One of the pre-requisites for children attending school in Tanzania is that parents must contribute to scholastic materials like school uniform and shoes, of which he has neither. His parents, both farmers, are unable to earn more than £375 a year in wages. They are sustaining a family of five. Matteus was identified through the partnership as being from an incredibly poor background, which would prevent his enrolment. He wakes early to ensure all the farm chores are complete by 11am. When he returns from school at 6pm he collects the cattle from the pastures and then helps his mother in the house with any jobs. Matteus and his siblings have two meals a day of porridge and bananas. They cannot afford any protein in their diet.Elizabeth, now 16, was enrolled at school aged 13 with the partnership, which helps the hardest to reach children struggling with things like poverty, early marriage and female genital mutilation. At age six, her father passed away, followed by her mother when she was 12. She was placed under ship of her uncle, who was arranging her marriage, with her unaware. The incentive for parents looking to marry their daughters is to benefit from sizeable dowry payments, more often livestock or land. Elizabeth’s second uncle heard the news of the marriage arrangements and spoke to the new education programme. Elizabeth wanted to enjoy her right to education and her second uncle helped void the pending marriage arrangements. She explained how extremely grateful she is to the foundation that gave her the opportunity to enrol and avoid the marriage she never wanted.Mamoke, 10, has never been to school. Abandoned by her biological parents along with her eight siblings, she now lives with her grandmother in the village of Kuriyah. She grazes cattle six hours a day for her grandmother in return for her keep. She was registered for school but never enrolled. Her grandmother and  is unable to afford the voluntary parental contribution fees. Mamoke describes her household as poor, her grandmother unable to provide more than one meal per day for her. Mamoke added, “There are many days where we do not eat at all.” She dreams of becoming a teacher, if she was able to go to school, so she can help others in her current situation.Josephine, 14, is an orphan and now lives with her aunt. She lost her parents and youngest sister to Aids, however, her blood-work is clear and negative. She was enrolled into the joint education partnership in 2017. Living far from school, she is forced to travel 4km to get there. Poverty remains a constant worry for Josephine as her aunt will not contribute to the additional costs. When asked what it meant to her to have access to education she replied, “Being in school means I will face less hardship and have a less fragile future. I would much prefer to be in class than live at home with my aunt who tries to prevent my going to school. She often beats me. She wants me to get married.” She was identified by the partnership as being vulnerable and teachers would buy her exercise books to ensure she doesn’t go without. Despite being three years behind she is catching up extremely quickly and ranking in the top five students out of 168 pupils.A young girl nervously clasps her hands as she explained how she was beaten repeatedly and threatened with being married off at the age of 13. In remote rural parts of Tanzania, the average age of marriage is between 12-13, from which point they are invited to leave the family home and fend for themselves. This makes them extremely vulnerable.A young boy seated in a dark classroom.

She lives with her mother and six siblings, who have all become domestic servants in houses. Education up to the age of 16 is free in Tanzania, except for the parental voluntary contributions. Her mother, a farmer, only earns £380 per year and has been paying £69 towards “informal” school fees for her daughters. Maryam has ambitions of becoming a nurse. She wants to help women, explaining: “Women are very vulnerable in Tanzania, friends my age have been married or propositioned for early marriage”. And she added, “Young girls in primary transitioning to secondary schooling take risks walking to school of being kidnapped.”1518 A classroom blackboard used to provide lessons at Remagwe Primary SchoolToday challenges to establishing an effective and stable education system persist. Assistance from international donors and partnerships helps the Tanzanian government achieve universal primary education and refurbish classrooms to improve the learning experience for children.As challenging as it is to see past the barriers to providing a quality education for children, small changes such as repainting blackboards for teachers and students can have enormous and direct benefits.Alex, 13, explained: “I can no longer wash my clothes any more as they will fall apart”. He has no school uniform, unlike many schools in Tanzania, his school still allow him to attend class. His sandals are torn and one held together by a bit of wire twisted at the sole. Alex enrolled into the first grade of his school in 2017 at the beginning of the EACGraca Machel Trust partnership. He lost his father when he was very young to a simple case of diarrhoea.

Classroom furniture is in need of repair and broken floors leave a surface of sand or mud. In 2001, Tanzania eliminated public school fees to increase access to primary education.

No better example of this can be illustrated than in rural and remote parts of Tanzania, where a 12-year-old boy, out of school, forced\u0026nbspinto a life of work, trapped in a dead-end cycle of danger and despair so he can provide for his family, provides perspective. He says: “I have no choice, I know the work is dangerous but I feel I have to help provide for my brothers and sisters. It makes me sad not being able to go to school.”Chacha works 12-hour shifts, seven days a week, under the cover of darkness to avoid detection, on one of the many small-scale gold mining sites in the northwest of the country. Illegally, he scavenges the mines for residue-bearing rock which he digs up and sells to middle-men who crush and extract the gold. Chacha’s cut of £1.50 a day is used to contribute to household bills. The work is exhausting and dangerous. Trespassers are shot on sight – even children.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesTanzania\u0026nbsphas strong laws governing child labour,\u0026nbspreinforced by the national action plan to eliminate the practice. The plan prohibits under-18s from engaging in hazardous work, including mining, but children are still lured into mines with the hope of changing their fortunes and those of their families.Chacha has never set foot in a classroom, perhaps he never will. He is one of the estimated 1.895 million children out-of-school children\u0026nbspin Tanzania today.New hope for Cambodia after the Khmer Rouge’s brutal war on educationHis only possible salvation may come through partnerships such as those between the Education Above All\u0026nbspFoundation (EAA) and Graca Machel Trust (GMT). These collaborations place a strong emphasis on capacity building – boosting schools in all areas to help them run efficiently and sustainably – as well as community engagement and service support. The EAA-GMT partnership has successfully enrolled 23,479 out-of-school children\u0026nbspin\u0026nbspquality primary education over\u0026nbsptwo years in the Mara region – comprising the most challenging and hardest to reach districts of Tanzania.GMT brought in the Complementary Basic Education in Tanzania (COBET) accelerated learning programme, to give a second chance to over-age learners who had never been to school – and to those who had dropped out.In 2001, Tanzania implemented the Primary Education Development Programme\u0026nbspand eliminated public school fees\u0026nbspto increase access to primary education. But\u0026nbspmany challenges have arisen. Schooling is now mandatory for children aged seven to 15, and although enrolment has dramatically increased, Tanzania has not yet achieved universal primary education. A majority of children in Tanzania do not attend school due to informal fees or voluntary\u0026nbspparental contributions required for enrolment. This includes, among other things, the compulsory purchase of shoes.All children should be able to attend primary school regardless of whether their parents can or can’t afford to pay or see the value, perhaps never having received\u0026nbspan education themselves. At its core, if a child fails to gain the basic skills required to contribute as a functioning member of\u0026nbspsociety, the loss is vast, not just to the child or society but the nation as a whole. For those sceptical, education can ultimately reduce poverty for future generations. Studies show the cost of educating children is far outweighed by the cost of not educating them.Their schools lie in ruins – but is there hope for Mosul’s children?Women of Gaza: Empowered and resilientThe global challenge to ensure all children can go to schoolSheikha Moza bint Nasser, chair\u0026nbspand founder of EAA, has dedicated much of her life to ensuring the most marginalised children can go to school, when there was no duty or expectation for her to do so. At\u0026nbspUnesco’s headquarters in Paris last year, she said: “Statistics cannot catalogue the impact of\u0026nbspchildren’s broken dreams. So we must not allow ourselves to be ‘numbed’\u0026nbspby the numbers, and we cannot accept apathy as a response. Because history, as we know, will judge us, by both what we do, and what we choose not to do.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At stake was the survival of Brexit.But the very future of Britain as a free market economy was too. It was vital the Tories won and it appears they have, convincingly.Corbyn and his poisonous, anti-Semitic cult have been crushed, hopefully terminally.The country must NEVER again be placed at risk from their extremism. Never.It falls now to Labour’s many moderate voters and MPs to take back control of their party and make it electable again.Boris’s Brexit deal can go ahead on January . Sensible, stable, strong government canafter three years of abject chaos and paralysis inflicted on us by Remain diehards.Their campaign and their second referendum are over.Boris can fulfil on his pledges, such as a £billion injection for the NHS, , more nurses and , new cops. He can deliver Brexit and keep taxes low across the board.The Sun campaigned for a Tory win because we believe Boris will make our readers’ lives better. It is that simple.Britain has many problems. Pay is too low. Homes are unaffordable for young people.The NHS is under immense strain. Too many regions have been left behind as London has prospered.But all our economic prospects will be vastly greater under the Tories than Magic Grandpa and his cult of halfwits.We are delighted to see the back of this utterly vile election campaign.It was far too long and almost unimaginably toxic, overwhelmingly due to Corbyn fans vilying their opponents in the street, on TV and on social media.Even so, Boris campaigned well, a couple of own-goals aside. Get Brexit Done looks to have proved as powerful a slogan as he hoped.And, while the Tories’ manesto played it too safe it was a stark contrast to Labour’s tsunami of unaffordable freebies.What should profoundly disturb us as a nation is that so many dismissed Corbyn’s anti-Semitism, his support for terrorists, his lies and his insane spending plans and voted for him anyway.Some claimed, in the same breath, that Labour might be racist but it is “progressive”. That is simply a contradiction in terms.Our great hope for Britain now is not just that Boris can reunite us and steer us wisely into a new era.It is that millions take a hard look at themselves and the Labour extremists they backed and feel some measure of shame.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He made sure lines of communication were kept open and regularly hopped on his motorbike and visited his grandparents and other members of his extended family.I suspect that being caught up in this nightmare, which has seen them appear on network TV both here and in the US, as well as an utterly surreal meeting with Donald Trump at the White House, has made it almost impossible for Harry’s parents to grieve properly for their son.They are still in shock, dazed and barely sleeping, and it is only their resolve to achieve justice for their son that is driving them on. Harry’s death made global headlines.Sadly, the spotlight shts all too quickly, and the world forgets about such tragedies and moves on. But Charlotte, Tim and Niall, and everyone who knew and loved Harry, lives with the pain every single minute of every single day.Charlotte told me that Niall, always the quieter and less out-going twin, is finding it extremely hard to come to terms with the death of his brother.He cannot bear to talk about what happened and is haunted because he doesn’t know exactly how Harry died.Tim has spoken about seeing his son’s poor shattered bloody body at the crash scene and how he tried to reassure him that all would be well, but his boy died shortly afterwards.Frankly, I don’t know how Anne Sacoolas can live with herself.If she had only stayed to help the police piece together what had happened, she would have had the chance to express her sorrow, and more than likely been given a suspended sentence.That would at least have given Harry’s family some peace of mind.Instead, Charlotte and Tim are trying to get US officials to listen to them and hoping Donald Trump will make good on his promise of getting something done.If the President thought he could steamroller this “ordinary” British couple during that encounter, he was soon put right.They turned down his clumsy attempt at setting up a meeting with Sacoolas, who was waiting in a White House side room. They didn’t want to be bounced into a Trump photo opportunity, and they also said they rejected an offer of compensation.Charlotte and Tim are also ready to file a civil lawsuit against Sacoolas in the state of Virginia, in an attempt to have her hand herself in to UK authorities.I spoke to them about how the family would face Christmas, and they simply shook their heads in sorrow. Fighting tears, Charlotte told me it was going to be horrendous, especially as Harry loved this time of year so much.I can’t get out of my head the image of them at home, surrounded by sadness, while neighbours in houses around them are making merry.Charlotte said it was made worse by the fact that Sacoolas will be able to celebrate Christmas with her children.It seems the Sacoolas family and the authorities are hoping thatthey stall long enough Charlotte and Tim are just going to go away.I can assure them that they will never give up.I sincerely hope this courageous couple, who are going through the torments of hell, somehow manage to shame officials here and in the US into doing what’s right.Sacoolas should be sent back to the UK to explain herself, apologise and face her punishment.New PM Boris Johnson has a bloody long to-do list, but justice for Harry must be one of his priorities.WILL he fall at the final hurdle Saturday night or will Anton du Beke go all the way and win his first ever Strictly Glitterball after  years of trying.If I was ever to do the showthen you can bet your le it would be poor old Anton who would have to shove me around the dancefloor like an overstuffed wardrobe.He tends to get the plucky no-hopers of a certain age, but this year was given a real contender in the shape of firecracker Emma Barton, from EastEnders.It’s too close to call with the other two finalists, Karim Zeroual and Amy Dowden, and Kelvin Fletcher and Oti Mabuse at the top of their game, but no one would begrudge Anton his moment of glory.JENNIFER Lopez celebrated her Screen Actors Guild Award nomination with an online message to her fans – while on a treadmill in the gym.Being J-Lo, her make-up was flawless, she was wearing a gorgeous tracksuit and she completed the look with fabulous hoop earrings.Despite working out, she wasn’t even glowing, never mind perspiring.What a contrast to the rest of us.I’m a sweaty, red-faced mess after my exercise class and look as though I’ve been dragged through every hedge in the land not just backwards, but forwards too.J-Lo has been nominated for a SAG for her role as Ramona in Hustlers, and during the message she even got a little teary, but of course without the red nose and puffy eyes of us mere mortals.She makes the world a more beautul place.She’s the powerhouse behind the insane Kardashian phenomenon and expert at making very little talent go a bloody long way.

If untreated it can lead to deafness, meningitis, and can reduce male fertility.It’s a direct result of parents refusing to let their kids be given the MMR jab when the recent crop of sufferers were babies at the turn of the century.Scare stories about MMR being linked with autism led to parents opting out of immunisation and now we are reaping the whirlwind.Health officials have urged anyone who hasn’t had the jab to do so immediately and have warned of a “public health time bomb”.There’s also been a surge in the cases of measles, a disease that can kill.It is outrageous that we are fortunate enough to have the science to eradicate these diseases completely, and save millions of lives in the process, but through misinformation, stubbornness and, even in a few cases sheer laziness, measles and mumps are being allowed to flourish once more.We need to get a grip and protect our babies, children and young people from harm that is easily preventable.WELL done to Great British Bake Off runner-up Steph Blackwell for being so refreshingly honest about her struggles with ious eating disorders.The -year-old, who was a joy to watch on the show, wants to help other people struggling with anorexia, bulimia and depression and to reassure them that things can get better.When she was , and in the grip of the illness, she would never have imagined one day she would be enjoying baking in front of the nation.Steph is proof that debilitating and often le-threatening eating disorders can be brought under control with understanding and the right kind of help.More power to her.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is now vital, economically and politically, the Tories pump money into those regions and transform them.The gap between them and London has been too wide too long.And our re-elected PM was dead right to make that his priority in his first speech at No since winning his thumping majority.We must “unite and level up”, he said. Exactly.Remainers may take a while to “unite”, to “heal”. But the levelling-up can start now, by spending on infrastructure, including big transport improvements.That, admittedly, takes years. In the short-term, low-tax zones and other tax breaks can revive High Streets and lure job-creating firms out of big cities and into regions which need the boost.More money for public services is key too. The NHS, social care and crime are priorities across the country. So are many more affordable homes.Visible improvements can be made rapidly, such as with a new determination to end rough sleeping, as the Blair Government almost did.For years The Sun backed the Tories as they cut spending to fix the chaos Labour left in .That work is largely done — and, let’s face it, public patience for penny-pinching is at an end.We will trust a Tory Chancellor infinitely more than a Marxist one to spend prudently without bankrupting us.Equally exciting is the power Boris now has both to reinvent the civil service to deliver on national priorities and to reshape our politics.The Tories have a golden chance to rebrand and recast themselves as the party of working people, of Sun readers — and end the lefties’ tired mantra that they serve only the rich.It is also time to fix the anti-Tory bias in our election system.It is incredible their big win came even despite constituency boundaries favouring Labour. These must be redrawn.Two years ago we said Britain needed a strong Tory majority to improve lives and take big decisions to reform public services. It has finally come true.We heartily congratulate the many new Tory MPs. Chiefly, though, we congratulate three men.One is Isaac Levido, the party’s talented and driven Aussie elections guru.The other two, Dominic Cummings and Boris himself, have genuinely made history twice, against staggering odds.They took on the Remainer establishment and won the Brexit vote in . Now they have crushed the Remainers’ long refusal to deliver on it.In one momentous instant, as the exit poll dropped at pm on Thursday, these men ended three and a half years of ­political purgatory and paralysis.All the trickery and plots of duplicitous Remainer MPs and their rogue Speaker Bercow to reverse the referendum came to nothing.All the expensive legal cases, the collusion with EU officials, the long PR campaign of hatred towards Leavers and Boris . . . all were for nothing.In that one moment Boris won his mandate, Brexit was secured and the “People’s Vote” charade destroyed.Corbynism — which had terried millions, not least Britain’s Jews — was instantly over too and the nation liberated from the shadow of hard-left extremism.Then one Brexit-blocking MP after another was dumped by voters.Cummings’s and Boris’s achievements cannot be overstated. They are victories on a dferent scale even from Tony Blair’s against an exhausted Tory Party.As for what remains of Blair’s party we say this: It is staggering to see Corbyn cling on, plainly hoping to stitch up the leadership for some hard-left successor.That will just guarantee ­perpetual irrelevance.He, McDonnell, Seumas Milne, their Momentum social justice warriors and their repugnant media foghorns must be driven out NOW.With a few honourable exceptions, Labour’s “moderate” MPs and voters have shown a repugnant lack of spine by failing to do so already.Indeed the hypocrisy of politicians like Jess Phillips and Stella Creasy has never been plainer, begging Britain to hand power to Corbyn and his anti-Semitic, terrorist-supporting mob, then denouncing them the instant they lost.These unprincipled charlatans backed a Marxist manesto, only to turn on it once voters recoiled. Shame on them. It may be too late anyway. Labour looks irredeemably in the grip of hard-left cranks.

rescuers searching the island in teams of two in a desperate bid to bring everyone home.They were seen wearing protective yellow suits and using breathing apparatus owing to the threat of toxic gases as they walk across the recently-erupted volcano.Aside from the volcanic risk, the wet weather in New Zealand is also a cause for concern for the recovery mission.Rain mixing with the heavy volcanic ash lying on the island could encase the bodies in a cement-like substance, making the recovery even more dficult.New Zealand authorities believe the force of the eruption resulted in one of the victims being knocked into the water.While the rescue team successfully recovered six bodies - all thought to be those of Australian tourists - the search is continuing for two more bodies, believed to be those of New Zealand tour guides.Authorities said one of those bodies was known to be in the water off the island, but was unable to be retrieved by ers on Friday.Deputy commissioner Mike Clement said there were nine ers in the water since  am today, working to a buddy system.He said:“We learned some stuff yesterday as a result of being on the island.The purpose of the planning day today is to work through the scenarios with that eighth person, where they could be. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg stripallw\"

The media intrusion on peoples lives is very high indeed.And the attacks that take place against family and loved ones of politicians continue and they are disgraceful and frankly they are disgusting.Sir Keir Starmer is now the favourite to take over as Labour boss - but Jess Phillips threw her hat in and Emily Thornberry gave a speech hinting shell go for it too. David Lammy also broke cover to suggest he will throw his hat into the ring to succeed Mr Corbyn.Tottenham MP Lammy said: “Of course I’m thinking about it, because people like me that have been in the party for  years have now got to do a lot of heavy lting to get us into the right place.”Ruth Smeeth declared that she lost her because Labour is now the racist party and blamed Corbyn, adding they should have ditched him months ago.Her furious tirade came as she announced she had “definitely lost” her seat on a crushing general election night for Labour.Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent South constituency was one of Labour’s “Red Wall” seats that fell to the Conservatives to re-draw the political map of England.She blasted: “Jeremy Corbyn’s actions on antisemitism have made us the nasty party. We are the racist party.“He should have gone many many, many months ago. I am, well I was, the Parliamentary chair of the Jewish Labour Movement.We passed a motion of no confidence in him in April.There is absolutely no justication for why he is still there and his personal actions have delivered this result for my constituents and for swathes of the country overnight.Smeeth lost her seat to the Conservatives, the first time in history theyve held the Stoke-on-Trent seat.And Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray, although retaining his seat, also last night brutalised Corbyn - amid claims the partys safest seat in Scotland was under threat.Murray - now Scotlands only Labour MP - said: Every door I knocked on, and my team and I spoke to , people, mentioned Corbyn.Not Brexit but Corbyn. I’ve been saying this for years.The outcome is that we’ve let the country down and we must change course and fast.Former Labour Foreign Secretary Jack Straw jumped on the bandwagon of critics, saying he was relieved Mr Corbyn had lost. He branded him an “apologist” for the IRA and said he “had this worry that the country could be in really dangerous hands” had Labour won.Labour moderate Wes Streeting said Mr Corbyn and his hard-left pals — who include Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell — must take the blame for the defeat.He added: “They had the leader they wanted, the NEC they wanted, the manesto the wanted. The one thing they didn’t have was the support of the British people.”Corbyn is still in denial about the flaws in his leadership and policies leading to Labours crushing defeat.He said: “I think the issue that dominated this election, ultimately, was Brexit.“Our policies, I’ve named some, there are many others I could name, were actually, all of them, inidually, very popular.“There was no huge debate or disagreement in the party about any of the policies in our manesto. The issue was, ultimately, the Prime Minister said he’s going to get Brexit sorted.”Corbyn thanked his sons before thanking his we for all that she puts up with because of the way in which the media behaved towards me, towards her and indeed towards my party during this election campaign.But clinging on to his Islington seat, Corbyn said it had been a very disappointing night as support for his party crumbled in Labours former heartlands.The MP ran as an outside candidate for the party leadership in  and managed to outlast two Tory prime ministers.But finally conceding defeat as the red wall was left in tatters, he said he will call it a day on his time as leader - although he refused to immediately step down.He said: I will not lead the party in any future general election campaign.I will discuss with my party to ensure there is a process of reflection on this result and I will lead the party during that period to ensure the discussion takes place and we will move on into the future.Upon Corbyns loss, the Tories’ Michael Gove sent a moving message to Jewish Brits. He reassured them they would “never have to live in fear again” after Corbyn’s defeat.He denounced the Labour chief for embracing “anti-Jewish rhetoric” and “anti-Jewish terrorists”. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was  re-visited, right down to a socialist icon like Dennis Skinner being ousted the same way Tony Benn was, and a thumping rejection of Labour giving Margaret Thatcher, like Boris Johnson, the chance to go after the enemy with a merciless vengeance. The Cabinet will now be dominated by hardline right-wingers like Priti Patel, Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, authors of a book called Britannia Unchained. It advocated Thatcherite free-marketeering taken to extremes, with everything up for sale and all workers’ rights turned to dust. This is what post-Brexit paradise will look like. As in  Labour has to take a hard look at itself and ask why many voters in their heartlands deserted them and how a man like Skinner, who held Bolsover for  years, can be so callously discarded by his own working-class people. But Johnson will inevitably let those people down. That’s what he specialises in. They will soon realise he won’t Get Brexit Done for their benefit and the only potential being unleashed will be for the rich to get even richer. During that  election Neil Kinnock famously warned usThatcher won “not to be ordinary, young, to fall ill or get old.”  Now that her heirs have won a huge majority I warn you not to be any of the above but also not to be dark-skinned, have a passport from the EU, be disabled or low paid, be in a trade union or be employed in the public sector. I warn you to expect the NHS to look unrecognisable, state school classes of -plus and a poverty-pay economy as the UK becomes a low-tax haven for sharks.

Pulling no punches, Mr Blunkett quoted Oliver Cromwell, telling the current Labour leader: In the name of God, go! Writing in The Daily Mail , he said: The clique running the Labour Party clearly regarded compromise as betrayal, because it dilutes their ideology.

As a result of the failure, Labour is in a position where it can do precisely nothing, the -year-old wrote, adding that the hopes of millions had been wrecked.

He called on Labouraposs National Executive Committee to ensure Mr Corbyn and his allies stand down in order to move the party forward.  If Corbynistas hang on, Mr Blunkett wrote, MPs and peers should declare themselves aposthe Labour Partyapos and remove top-down command.

The party’s MPs, members and union backers must now reflect on why it has lost four general elections in a row. While Jeremy Corbyn has accepted he has to go, the malaise within the Labour movement goes far deeper than just one inidual. The party needs to understand why it lost support in seats it had held, in some cases, for more than  years. There has to be a thoughtful examination of which parts of its manesto resonated with voters and which were seen as too ambitious. And there must be a y exploration of why Labour does not have a single MP in Essex, Worcestershire, Cornwall and Lin­­colnshire... to take a handful of the many constituencies now painted completely blue. After nine years of austerity imposed by an unpopular government this should have been an election where Labour cleaned up. Instead voters decided a Tory government best represented their interests. Labour does not just need to rebuild its red wall of seats, it needs to build bridges with areas which have not backed the party since the days of Tony Blair. The worst response by Labour would be to spend the next few months engrossed in an internal battle for the soul of the party. If there is one lesson from the Corbyn era it is that factionalism and ision inevitably lead to defeat at the ballot box. Playing the blame game will not just be self-indulgent, it will also be counter-productive. Rebuilding Labour will take time but the task has never been more essential. In the next few years it will be more important than ever that there is a strong opposition ready to hold the Government to account and remind people there is a better way, based on better values.

The result is nothing less than devastating. The Red Wall crumbled. Seats which have been held by Labour since the end of World War I are now in the hands of Boris Johnson. This is the worst Labour defeat in  years. And now, we must work out why it happened. Labour’s Leave voters were always in the minority. But losing them proved fatal, tipping the balance in the Conservative’s favour in key English constituencies across the former industrial heartlands. The British electoral system is unforgiving of uneven vote distributions, and even though Corbyn managed to claim just over % more of the vote than Ed Miliband, he wound up with  fewer seats than Labour’s tally after the  election. So does Corbyn’s bruising losses in ex-industrial strongholds mean that his party have lost touch with the working class  Initial polling suggests there’s not a massive dference in the Labour vote across social grades. The really striking story from election  is about age. Out of ’s voters, the Tories command a majority of the electorate aged  and over. But under s  Corbyn absolutely cleaned up. A whopping % of - year olds voted for Labour. And don’t tell me that young people - who are overrepresented in low waged work, burdened by personal debt, and trapped in the extortionate private rental sector - don’t count as the “real” working class. Unlike previous generations, I don’t think that Corbyn’s core support of young voters will necessarily get less radical with age, for the simple reason that they have been failed by s of the status quo. Even when Brexit was nothing but a glint in Farage’s eye, the young people of this country were fobbed off and sold out by politicians of the sensible centre.

People are being urged to look for brown, hard walnut-sized lumps, which look like pine cones, as they may in fact be a sac of - praying mantis eggs. The lumps are usually found on the end of branches and your toasty living room is the prime environment for the critters to hatch. Molly Kreuze, from Springfield, Virginia in the US, was stunned to find her Christmas tree had smuggled hundreds of bugs into her home. She found them crawling up her walls, ceilings and even in her bathroom and bedroom. “They’re fast. They jump,” she said. To catch the bugs, veterinarian Molly used a box and an envelope, as well as feeding them fruit flies before they were removed from her home. “In my Googling, I discovered that people really like praying mantises,” she said. “They are useful, they eat other bugs. People use them for organic gardening.” Praying mantises can grow to be up to  inches long, according to  National Geographic . And the insects, typically brown or green, are well-camouflaged on trees and other plants. Daniel Reed also previously issued the warning on social media about the bugs and his message has been doing the rounds once again this year.  More than , Facebook users have shared the post, with thousands more commenting on it. Daniel advised thatyou find the lump on your tree, to simply cut off the branch and put it outside in the garden. He wrote: If you happen to see a walnut sized shaped egg mass, on your Christmas tree, don’t fret, clip the branch and put it in your garden. These are - preying mantis eggs! We had two egg masses on our tree this year. Don’t bring them inside they will hatch and starve! One person commented: “Another reason I have a fake tree.” A second said: “If I start seeing things crawling across the floor I will be gone until after Christmas.”  A third wrote: “If only I knew this last year before they hatched and were all over my walls.” The warning only applies to real Christmas trees and finding clumps are rare, especially in the UK. However, a Norway Spruce, Scots Pine or Fraser Fir might have once been home to one of the bugs. Research has also revealed that legions of lice, mites, moths and spiders can be lurking in Christmas trees too. [Bugs] hibernate for the winter and usually empty their bodies of fluids, produce a chilled liquid and become completely inactive, said Bjarte Jordal, associate professor of the University Museum of Bergen told the  IB Times  .  Upon feeling the heat and being awakened by the light, they believe that springtime has arrived and spring back to le. If you pound the tree on a white cloth before you throw it out after Christmas, you will discover quite a number of small bugs. The study also found that most mites will remain on the trees and soon die owing to a lack of food available to them indoors. A number of people have been sharing their horror stories. One wrote on social media: “A couple years ago the egg case was really hidden because we check our trees well. “After it was in the house for several weeks they sprang or hatched and yes a couple hundred.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad left open mouthed aldis","story":"NewsDad left open-mouthed at Aldis £. breakfast sandwich - and photo says it allJoel Turner, from Stroud in Gloucestershire, grabbed an Aldi All Day Breakfast sandwich which looked packed full of ingredients, but the reality was very dferentShareCommentsByKelly-Ann MillsAmber Hicks:,  DEC Updated:,  DEC NewsJoels disappointing sandwich from Aldi \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

At the age of , Chris had a stroke, and was later diagnosed with prostate cancer. In the following years, his successful property company folded and he was forced to sell all his worldly possessions. Chris, now , said: We had the big house, the car, everything, then the perfect storm blew and it all fell apart. I had a stroke, which really knocked me off my feet, found I had prostate cancer then people I had really trusted let me down financially.  Between  and ,  I saw everything evaporate before my eyes, cars, property, business and sadly people I had considered friends. Only one person stayed true, my partner. I sold everything I could to keep us going but it wasnapost enough. Friends offered to help to start with but, when you have nothing, no-one wants to know you anymore. Chris, who now lives in Stirchley and has asked for his partner and her child to remain anonymous, added: It was like a vacuum of nothingness. Iaposd grown up with prosperous parents and had always had money in my pocket. Now I was wondering what are we going to eat tonight  I had absolutely nothing when I walked out of my house. I couldnapost take my family photos, pictures of my mother were lost because thereaposs only so much you can take with you. All those memories were left behind. I was ready to sleep under a hedge. The family spent several months sleeping in their car in the freezing temperatures, desperately trying to find food and stay warm and clean. Chris said: We spent that Christmas in our car. Ordinary family celebrations are forgotten, it just becomes another day to try to find something to eat. I used to be a pilot with the air force so I know how to survive but for my partner and her daughter the hardships they suffered were horrendous. Keeping clean is such a problem when youaposre homeless. I have a masters degree but I couldnapost get a job in a warehouse because I looked so dirty. Eventually, Chris made the decision to relocate his family to the countryside, believing they would feel safer.  They went to Worcestershire, where they chanced upon a couple who helped them turn their lives around. Chris said: The city is a hostile place and, with a very young child, I wanted us to be safe. I thought it would be easier to survive in the countryside than the city so we drove as far as we could until our petrol ran out and that was Worcestershire. Then we met a farmer and his we who showed us such kindness. They offered us their garden shed to sleep in. It was spring  and was bitterly cold with snow on the ground. This gave us a fire to keep warm and we could walk to the farm workersapos shower block to have a wash and use the lavatory. It may not sound much, but it became a palace, it gave us a little bit of pride back and the confidence to move forward and rebuild our lives. I shall be eternally grateful to them because without that help I’m sure we would not be here today. To make money to buy food, Chris and his partner began selling logs. They were then put in touch with a team that helps to re-house the homeless by offering them subsidised rent and zero deposit.  The family still sells logs, and now rents a small house in Stirchley. Now, they want to pay forward the kindness that they were shown by helping other homeless people to get off the streets. They have set up a project called Just the Ticket - a discount voucher scheme that encourages people to hop locally and donate to the homeless at the same time. Chris said: Our idea is simple. We approach local independent businesses and ask them to generate an offer that will attract customers to their company – it may be a coffee shop that gives a cake for buying a latte, it may be a travel shop that offers  per cent off the cost of a holiday. He added: The shops pay for the vouchers to be printed and bundles of a dozen or so dferent vouchers are put inside a cover that explains the offers to the public. The books of vouchers are then sold for around £ each by homeless people who get to keep all they take. It’s a win – win.

Gayle Paterson, , was told her £ benefits would be cut - and could now be forced to use food banks for the festive period.The strict rules around wage payment dates means she will miss out on the vital funds forcing her into debt, reports TeesideLive .She works part-time as a home shopper at Asda in Southbank, Middlesbrough, and gets paid every four weeks. The Department of Work and Pensions claim that the wages she received from her employer on November  and December  fall into the same assessment period - which is from November  to December . They say Gayle has been paid twice, despite her payments being received in dferent months.Gayle said thatshe had been paid from Asda just one day later she would have been entitled to her normal Universal Credit payment of £.Gayle, from Teesville, Middlesbrough, said: Iaposm just absolutely devastated. I have always worked to top up my wage. Before I worked in Asda I worked part-time in Superdrug for  years. I work so hard only for this to happen. It makes me question what I am working for! Itaposs the worst time of year. Iaposve got no money to pay for anything. I wonapost even be able to buy little things like Christmas cards for people. People come into work to get Christmas bits and they askI have done all my Christmas shopping. I lie to them because I feel like I canapost say no. How are you expected to manage  I feel like there is no support out there.  Gayle said that she uses her Asda wage to pay half of her rent and bills for her car, which she uses to get to work at am.

She said: When they put the phone down I was left there sitting on my bed crying. I was thinking what now  They wonapost give me a Universal Credit loan, they said that I earn too much.  Iaposm going to end up in arrears because I canapost afford to pay my rent, my water rates and my gas and electricity. I had to go to the food bank when I changed over to Universal Credit in January as I had no payment for six weeks. I worry that I will have to go to the food bank this month. Iaposm sure there will be other people in my situation. Gayle, who is separated from her ex-husband, lives with her son Thomas, , and her daughter Charlotte, .

Maddalena Fiorello Beesley was found dead at home less than a week after her boyfriend flagged the deterioration of her mental health, Birmingham Coroner’s Court heard.The -year-old librarian - known as Madi - had suffered depression since childhood, previously attempted suicide and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, Birmingham Live reports. Boyfriend Paul Barnes had warned her therapist of his plans to end their relationship on August  - a move which could have increased her risk of suicide. The mental health teams were aware Madi had taken an overdose following a previous break-up, the inquest heard. But aposno actionapos was taken after Mr Barnes contacted them and the system at Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust is now under review. Madi, who worked at the University of Birmingham, was found dead shortly before pm on August  at her house. Area Coroner Emma Brown recorded a verdict of suicide and concluded there had been aposclear failingsapos at an inquest hearing on Monday .Mr Barnes, who was also Madiaposs carer, expressed concerns on August , ahead of her final psychotherapy session. She had been attending therapy for nine months with Laura Chaisty, a specialist psychotherapist and art psychotherapist for Birmingham and Solhull Mental Health Trust. As a result of Mr Barnes contact, Miss Chaisty penned a y email to the Community Mental Health Team as she was due to go away on annual leave for two weeks. I contacted the Community Mental Health Team to raise their awareness of Madi and to say that she may need extra support, she told the court. My sense was that Madi may make contact and that might raise further input from the Community Mental Health Team. I didnapost feel that the level of risk was dferent. I did know there was a circumstance change which is why I raised their awareness of her.  Sharon Whitehead, a registered mental health nurse, picked up the email from Miss Chaisty but no attempt was made to contact Madi. A risk assessment was not looked at nor updated. Mrs Whitehead told the inquest: It didnapost worry me at the time. When I read the email I thought it was for information only. But because she had her appointment [that day] I was confident that they would make that assessment and that judgement. During the last session Madi expressed suicidal thoughts with her therapist - but Miss Chaisty said this was apossadly normal for herapos. It was dficult for her to feel vulnerable and ask for help. It was really dficult for Madi to reach out, she explained. Miss Chaisty did not believe her risk of suicide was increased at that point and no further contact was made with Madi or the mental health team. It is with great regret that I did not feel there was an additional risk, she added, addressing Madiaposs family. There were other concerns that Madi should have had a care coordinator to manage the two services and act as a support line - especially while her psychotherapist was away on leave. This policy that every patient should have a coordinator is currently under review, the court was told. Madiaposs mum Clelia Boscolo questioned why she was never contacted over her daughteraposs welfare concerns - and instead was only called two days after her death when it was too late.

A bystander who witnessed the commotion said the man was being escorted out of the station after he was allegedly caught urinating on the  by staff. The commuter, who was standing in the entrance to the station while he waited for a friend, said: As he came up the escalator he was being very loud, which was what got my attention. I could hear him talking to staff about how his taxes paid their wages and that there should be toilets available in all tube stations. When he got to the gates, staff were trying to guide him out, which is when he started verbally abusing one of them. I heard him say, aposAre you a Muslim with that beard apos Thataposs when I got my phone out to start recording. In the footage, the man can be heard shouting you f***ing dirty Muslim c**t, several times at the man before yelling: I pay my taxes so you can stand there and do this for a living. After an exchange of words, another member of staff intervenes and attempts to calm the situation down. The man continues to rant as he is told multiple times to leave the station.  The person who recorded the video said: I am mixed race myself and felt very uncomfortable the entire time. The staff had the situation under control and I think they handled it very well but I was shocked at how loud and forceful he seemed. I was worried it could have escalated further.

The Christmas tradition which has taken Britain by storm in recent years sees an elf keep an eye on the little ones in the lead up to Christmas and reports back to Santa on whether children have been naughty or nice.After long days compiling a report, the Elf then flies back to the North Pole each night to keep Father Christmas up to date, before ing to the home and hiding in a dferent location each morning to ensure itaposs got the whole house covered, as reported by the Birmingham Mail .The naughty elf often finds itself in trouble as it is caught in cheeky situations, keeping the kids on their best behaviour for the whole of advent.  Some parents also use Santaaposs little helper for their own entertainment, such as being pictured getting on the booze or in a very compromising position with Barbie , while their children are asleep.All the moving around the house can quickly turn the festive fun into a hair-pulling task for parents to come up with new ways to bring the elf to le each night. But a brilliant new idea will have mums and dads everywhere breathing a sigh of relief - and all you need is a television and Youtube.  If you have a smart TV, all you need to do is go to the Youtube app and search aposElf stuck in TVapos. The elf then appears on the screen with the message aposI hit the wrong button on the remote... how do I get out of here apos The image appears as an hour-long video meaning you can set it up before your children wake up and it will delight them when they come down for breakfast.

Everybody in this league would want to add quality to their squad.“Looking at the bench on Saturday at Arbroath, we are a bit short. If we get a couple of injuries then you are short but you are always looking to improve anyway.“I’ve said before, I don’t want to go back to chopping and changing  players or whatever every window. That has happened for a number of windows at this club and that has to stop.“That’s why we were so busy in the summer so we don’t have to keep doing that. It has taken a bit of time to get everything right since then.“We are looking where we are short and what we can add but it has to be quality not just to add numbers to bulk up the squad for the second half of the season.”Next up for the Dark Blues is a home clash with one of the form sides in the ision at the moment, Dunfermline.Since Dundee have taken just one point from their last , Stevie Crawford’s Pars have racked up three wins on the spin.“It shows you what can happen,” added James. “We’ve kind of switched. Dunfermline have started winning games and we’ve started losing them.“I met Stevie at a reserve game recently and we were talking about how quickly things can turn.“It shows you thatyou put a couple of results together you’re right back up there. They’re in the play-off places where we need to get back to.“It’s a big game on Saturday, we need to be really positive and take the game to them.”The Dens gaffer is wary of the threat posed by Dunfermline frontman Kevin Nisbet, who has scored  goals in his last seven matches for the Pars.But he says,his team can supply the Dundee strikers with the service Nisbet has enjoyed at East End Park then it’ll be the home attackers making the headlines.He said: “Nisbet is a player I like.“He was a threat in the first game of the season and we’ve obviously seen what he can do since then.“They get the ball into the box for him. The big thing is they’re creating the chances for him and he’s putting them away.“I believe we’ve got strikers who are every bit as good as anybody in the league – and they will score plenty of goals with the right service.Arbroath - Dundee: Dark Blues# winless run extends to four thanks to Bobby Linn#s curler\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arbroath---dundee-dark-blues-winless-run-extends-to-four-thanks-to-bobby-linns-curler embed # secrettQXpZpu\" data-secret\"tQXpZpu\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“With the strikers we’ve got in our team, we have to play to their strengths.

When you are full of confidence you try things you wouldn’t do when it’s low.“The only way it is going to come back is by picking up results and grafting in training.“Hopefully, we can turn things soon.”Dundee head back to Dens Park aiming to rebuild their relationship with the home faithful after some very disappointing displays.However, Byrne says the Pars are a perfect example of how quickly things can turn around after three straight wins has seen Stevie Crawford’s side shoot up the ision.Byrne said: “We’ve got to win the fans round but we have to do it for ourselves as well.“It’s down to us to get results. We know it hasn’t been good enough as a team and inidually, so we need to get results. Only those will get fans back onside.”He added: “You could see when we got our three wins in a row it pushed us right up the table and you can see that now with Dunfermline.“I think they were down in mid-table and now they are up in third. One result can change a lot in this league and we need that.“Dunfermline will come here confident after a few good results but we are at home and we need to use that advantage.“We had a decent home record up until the last few. We need to get wins here and make this a hard place to come.”Byrne began his career with Dunfermline in the old First Division before moving on to Livingston after three years.There are still one or two old faces around the club he remembers but the midfielder insists his only focus is on his own, and the team’s, performance.“It’s a club I know really well and they gave me a chance to play in the first team,” he added.“I have a lot of good memories there but it was a long time ago now. I want to concentrate on doing well for Dundee, though.“I know myself I’ve not been good enough. I’ve had some good games but I’ve not played well consistently enough week to week.“When we got those three wins in October I was starting to feel good. Inidually, I know I can be a lot better.“I’m not going to say I’m going to do this and that.

She spent most of her time alone in her bedroom.One day she randomly bought an embroidery kit online and became hooked on having a task and “creating something beautul”, improving her feeling of self-worth in the process.Inspired, she was suddenly eager to take part in crafting sessions to learn more but could only manage a few steps outside the door.Nicola said: “Everyone was out living their lives and to me an achievement would be only napping once a day, instead of three times.“When I first started going out again it was terrying. I felt so shaky and unsure of everything.“I’d been in the house so long that one of our downstairs neighbours who moved in four years earlier didn’t even know I lived there.“I knew from research it was important not to push myself into things too fast, so I stopped at the end of the path.“Turning around to go back inside was a huge relief and getting back into our flat was like being wrapped in a big safety blanket but I soon became aware of how confined I was inside.” vw, px\"  Nicola slowly began to attend crafting workshops with her parents also in attendance, the first of which was a puppet making class ran by How It Felt.The social enterprise uses puppet-making and drama sessions to encourage people to talk about mental health issues, which Nicola says played a huge part in her recovery journey.From there she got the confidence to join other crafting groups and started an online distance learning course with the Embroiderer’s Guild to ease back into studying.Nicola says she still often feels unwell but the intensity has reduced to such an extent that she hopes to one day study at Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design."},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"sweet-smell-success-stunning-star-sophia-loren","story":"ON A rainy day in Glasgow, Sophia Loren gazes wistfully across the city, as starry-eyed shoppers gathered below in the hope of catching a glimpse of their idol."},{"url":null,"title":"2020-edition-glasgow-times-past-calendar---need-know","story":"ITS the bestselling calendar that each year showcases some great images from our huge photo archive."},{"url":null,"title":"rich-man-poor-man-life-expectancy-gap","story":"Men in the poorest areas of Glasgow are expected to die  years earlier than in the most affluent areas of Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"pre-payment-changes-scottish-gas-accounts","story":"Scottish Gas customers are being warned about changes to pre-payment accounts coming in the new year."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-st-mungo-miracles-know-history-books","story":"THE trouble with the Dark Ages is that they are very aptly named.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Not only did this save a great deal of money but the board  also earned considerable extra income by selling their products to other health boards, including Dumbarton and Argyll.All in all, the costs of building and equipping the Hillhead factory proved to be a very sound investment indeed.Duncan I Macdougall, TarbertSir,I write following last week#s open letter by SNP politicians Mike Russell and Brendan O#Hara in which they attempted to evade responsibility for the budget problems facing Argyll and Bute Council.These comments display extraordinary hypocrisy, revealing how out-of-touch these SNP politicians are with the realities of the challenges facing Argyll and Bute Council.The financial pressures on this council are a direct consequence of the repeated unfair financial settlements imposed on the council by the SNP government over the last  years.Brendan O#Hara should get on the phone to Nicola Sturgeon and demand a fair deal for Argyll and Bute instead of blaming everyone .Donald Cameron MSP, Highlands and Islands"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters human impact on climate change then and now","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHuman activity from the industrial revolution onwards is causing global warming which,not halted, will have catastrophic consequences.Now scientists suggest that human activity several centuries earlier also caused climate change*.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay. The full back ran  yards to score under the posts and then convert his own try.SAS were next on the score sheet when Captain Donald Self went over the whitewash. MacKay converted and SAS were  –  up.Some good play from both teams was making for a great game, enjoyed by a large home crowd. Pupils were given the chance to watch the game and they made their voices heard and, spurred on by the crowd, Euan MacArthur was next on the score sheet and once again MacKay converted the try.The first half finished - to the home team.The second half started with Boclair coming back at SAS and, after some good running, they pulled a try back.SAS found themselves under sustained pressure and soon Boclair had a second try. Only one try was converted, and the score was -. Another try, this one converted, for Boclair and the pressure was really on.South Argyll thought they had secured the game when Ellis went over and grounded the ball only to realise he had gone over the dead ball line. No try and the pressure was on again. Minutes later, after some great forward work to turn the ball over, McArthur again went over for South Argyll#s fourth try. Another two points from MacKay made the score -.After the restart Boclair went all out to get another score. Great defensive work from the SA backs kept Boclair out for a sustained period of attack until, with only seconds to go, the scored their fourth try.As the conversion attempt fell short the final whistle blew and South Argyll celebrated a hard-fought win.While South Argyll didn not get out of the group stages they can be very pleased with third place,only one point behind second spot."},{"url":null,"title":"a garden of festive delight","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowNot your common or garden evening of entertainment, a special festive concert will be held next week near Minard.Friends of Crarae will present their annual carol concert at Crarae Garden on Thursday December .The evening will feature Cumlodden choir and guests and the audience is welcome to sing along.Festive refreshments and a raffle will be available at the concert, which opens at .pm for a .pm start.Tickets will cost £ on the door, and the National Trust for Scotland shop will be open for those last-minute gts."},{"url":null,"title":"an ardrishaig piano recital to remember","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSaturday November  was a cold and frosty day and, whilst the audience had the luxury of warm hats and coats to fend off the chill of a  degrees centigrade hall, this was not afforded to soloist of the day, the -year-old Ukrainian Russian pianist Vitaly Pisarenko.When many would, however, have struggled with the cold, from his first entry he appeared unphased by it and indeed gave us a memorable exhibition of astonishing virtuosity and musicianship.Each half of his well-balanced programme started with early Beethoven sonatas, beginning with his first, Op. No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"no need for stress shop local in festive lochgilphead","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more #

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Last month rector William Crossan said staffing levels were being reviewed and two teaching posts could be lost at the school.On Monday Lieutenant Commander Mark Farley of the US Navy told the Kintyre Working Group that there was only a #remote possibility# that a pull-out would be cancelled. He added: #But you can be sure of our desire to stay.#An outstanding relationship has been built up with the local people, and it is a perfect location, with great training facilities.#It is understood that no alternative location for the unit has been identied yet.And RAF spokesman said there had been talks with the US military about the withdrawal.#The future of the base is under continuing review and the departure of the US Navy is not the only factor which has to be taken into account.#In June RAF Machrihanish was reduced to #care and maintenance# status.FIFTY YEARS AGOShellfish plant operationalCampbeltown at last has a stake in the new, growing shellfish processing industry.Two local men, Mr George McMillan and Mr Duncan L.

This output is expected to increase next week, when they will employ an additional three workers.At present  bags of the #queenie# scallops are being processed daily. By the beginning of December it is hoped that  bags will be handled.Mr George McMillan said that it is hoped eventually to employ from  to  people. He stressed that meantime Davaar Seafoods was occupying only part of the slaughterhouse building on a temporary basis. He mentioned that the firm was #hoping to get the whole building#.Samples of Davaar Seafoods produce were sent to consumers in Chicago and Paris and opinions passed on the quality of the samples were favourable.The scallop processing method employed is a simple one. The shellfish are dipped into hot water, and the shells open. The insides of the creatures are removed and scraped clean. Then the meat is thoroughly washed.Shellfish factories are operating successfully in Tarbert and Port Ellen.Harmony Hour guests of R.A.F. on thThe th of November,  will long be remembered by the members of Campbeltown Harmony Hour Club who were guests at an excellent fireworks display at R.A.F.

Burnley Campbell, and others also extended a cordial welcome, the men being cheered as they marched with the colours to headquarters.The cadre was entertained at a civic luncheon in McColl#s Hotel in the afternoon.Those present said they were delighted to welcome home the local battalion. Throughout the war they had watched with pride the heroic work performed by the battalion, and they would remember with gratitude the sacrices that had been made.Maclachlan of Maclachlan mentioned that the total casualties of the  th Argylls during the war were  officers and  other ranks.The honours of the regiment received were one V.C., two D.S.O.#s, many M.C.#s and M.M.#s, and other lesser honours.Major Lockie, who commanded the cadre, acknowledged the cordial welcome they had received.A day of remembranceThe King#s desire that the first anniversary of the Armistice should be observed by a two minutes silence in reverent remembrance of the glorious dead was fulfilled all over the country on Tuesday.In London wreaths were laid on the Cenotaph in Whitehall. These included one from the King and Queen, one from President Poincaré and one from the Prime Minister.The scenes in the streets of Glasgow were full of solemnity, when all traffic stopped and the crowds stood in reverent silence as the clocks stuck eleven. Work ceased in the Clyde shipyards and on the shipping in the river.In Campbeltown the signal was given by the sounding of three long syren blasts from H.M.S. Thames, and the fallen were honoured by the uncovering of heads.Of course in a comparatively quiet country town the tribute lacked the impressiveness that characterised it in busy cities.In the Grammar School the scholars assembled in the large room at .a.m., when the rector gave a short address on the meaning of the celebration, read the King#s message, and explained shortly the aims of the League of Nations Union.A hymn as then sung, the two minutes# silence observed, and after the National Anthem had been sung, the pupils were dismissed for the day.In Dalintober School the period of silence was similarly observed and the scholars were afterwards dismissed."},{"url":null,"title":"leader november 15 2019","story":"Remembrance is one of the main topics in this week#s Courier.We increasingly rely on our youngsters to keep the memory of the First and Second World Wars alive as those who experienced them first-hand # and second-hand # fade away.Renowned First World War poet Wilfred Owen, who was himself killed in action in , wrote of #the old lie# # #Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori#, which translates from Latin as #It is sweet and proper to die for one#s country#.Remembrance should not be about glorying war, but remembering the horric atrocities which are committed in its name so that in future they may be avoided.The four young people who took part in the service at Glenbarr War Memorial are direct descendants of men from the area who fell in battle.

I think the going rate was £ per day, quite a sum in , and I believe there was quite a queue, unfortunately I couldn#t sign up as I was working at Jaeger.It was quite an event and some friends who were taking part told me later about their experiences with fake blood and bandages etc and others getting kitted out with Russian army unorms and weapons. Several of the buildings around the airfield were flying the Hammer and Sickle and painted up with Russian signage etc to suit the situation.If I remember correctly the premiere of the finished film was shown in Campbeltown and those watching who had ever flown into the town on normal domestic flights could easily recognise the approach to the airport and runway with the loch beyond. With a few patches of articial snow here and there it could well have been in Siberia. There were great hoots and laughter at the showing whenever those in the audience recognised their pals in unorm with rles at the ready or being carried in on stretchers. Great memories.I also remember the scrapped jet engines from the wrecked airliner lying in McFadyen#s yard in Glebe street for a long time.

Social care, mental health and primary care services are all crying out for more support, and better resourcing them would take the pressure off the accident and emergency service.The SNP government have failed to meet the AE target time every month for over two years. They need to take swt action to properly prepare AE departments before winter sets in. A good place to start would be publishing the integrated workforce plan that staff were told would be out last year. Another broken SNP promise.Yours,Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll  Bute.Connected nationSir,Before I address Alan Reid’s comments on superfast broadband , it ought to be remembered that this is the same ex Liberal Democrat MP who propped up the Tories and imposed years of toxic austerity measures on Scotland, shrinking the UK economy by £ billion, imposing Dickensian social policies # like the Bedroom Tax # on the poorest in society, and voluntarily choosing to make Tory cuts possible.The Liberal Democrats are deeply stained by austerity and they will remain, rightly, untrusted as the Tories little helpers.Mr Reid berates the SNP government for alleged failure to deliver superfast broadband. Yet, inspite of the unique dficulties in delivering superfast broadband in rural Scotland, which BT described as the ‘most signicant geographic challenge in the UK, and arguably Europe’, the latest Ofcom ‘Connected Nations’  report shows that Scotland outperforms the UK as a whole when it comes to new broadband deployment.There remains work to be done and the Scottish government is committed to delivering the best possible value and completing the roll out by  .Mr Reid is right to say that contracts have not been finalised yet, but with telecommunications and broadband reserved to Westminster, the changes in contracts imposed by UK ministers mean that bidders require additional time to recalibrate their bids.It is up to Mr Reid to carp from the sidelines, but readers can be confident that this SNP Scottish government will deliver a future proof network that will make Scotland one of the best connected places in Europe.Yours,Ron Wilson,Secretary Kintyre SNP.Coffee thanksSir,This year our World’s Biggest Coffee Morning fundraiser entered its th year.In community centres, schools and workplaces, thousands of coffee mornings were held across Scotland to raise money and help us support people affected by cancer.I would like to offer a huge and heartfelt thanks to every single one of your readers who held or attended a coffee morning – your energy and generosity never ceases to amaze us.Whether it’s specialist cancer nurses, support workers or benefit advisors, we can only offer the support that people with cancer need thanks to the tireless fundraising efforts of our supporters.The number of people who need our help is growing, and we want to offer support to everyone who needs it.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

One business owner accused the local authority of trying to ide and confuse people so they did not attend.It comes after the council:Haddington Business Community Partnership had asked the council to postpone the public consultation until the start of the new year because it believes the local authority has breached Scottish Government guidelines stating that consultation exercises should not be launched during local or national election periods.A spokesperson for the council has denied this is the case and insisted it is a normal part of pre-consultation process.Community councillor Pat Lemmon said the decisions of the council were disappointing.She said: ldquoIt does not encourage feelings of trust for everyone working together. The ground rules change by the day.And she said the councilrsquos handling of the proposals had caused major distrust among residents, particularly when it came to the independently produced Haddington Vision document officials use to support their case.She said: ldquoThe Haddington Vision strongly said any changes had to be looked at by all the stakeholders, by everyone concerned, to avoid any ill feeling, to make everyone feel they had been consulted as part of proposed plans.ldquoThe statement made that East Lothian Council hopes to be in a position to implement a decision by March  indicates to me that there appears to be a race on to secure funding for the transportation hub.ldquoIf this is the case, is this the right decision given the strong views for and against any proposed hub in the town and the proposed town centre plans currently being discussed by the steering group ldquoTo have such a meeting so close to Christmas, and the stakeholder consultation at a time when many people are working, seems to me to be a bad decision.ldquoI am very disappointed that such a decision has been made.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council previously confirmed that the drop-in event would run -pm, with a public notice in the Courier of November  confirming that was the case.The event was to give local residents and businesses ldquothe opportunity to discover more about the proposals for a transport hub in Haddington.She said: ldquoThey will also be able to see the progress and history of the project to date, including the consideration of  dferent sites across the town.ldquoComments can be recorded as part of this consultation which will help inform the future development of the proposal and will be followed by another consultation in the New Year.However, the public section of the event has been reduced to just  minutes.When asked why the format of the event had been changed, the spokeswoman said: ldquoDue to a combination of level of interest and availability of staff, a stakeholders meeting will be held at pm and invitees include local business owners, schools, community council, sports clubs, transport companies and accessibility and active travel interests. [The] public event will start at pm.Other sites considered for the car park and dropped for ldquoious reasons include the field between West Road, Park Lane, Pencaitland Road and Letham Drive, and the site of the former Haddington Nursery School Annexe, off Meadowpark, which has also been earmarked for a housing development.The plans for Whittingehame Drive, which were drawn up following a series of closed door meetings, came under fire from a number of Haddington residents.Concerns ranged from the loss of green space on the site, which is beside the townrsquos skate park and G sports pitches, to the potential for accidents with youngsters playing next to the car park.The transport hub, which would include a car park with somewhere between  and  spaces, could also include ldquobus connections, bike hire opportunities and new pathways.According to East Lothian Council, the facility,approved, has ldquothe potential to free up parking spaces in the town for short-stay use, making it easier for people to access local businesses, essential services and tourist attractions.However, business owners were among those raising concerns about the proposals.George James, who runs the East Lothian TV and Video Repair Centre on High Street, felt that the last-minute changes were an attempt by the council to ide people.He said: ldquoIt is clearly isive and an effort to stop people attending the public consultations.ldquoWe are a local business and have been told we cannot attend the stakeholdersrsquo meeting as we are not considered stakeholders.ldquoWe are encouraging as many people as possible to join a protest at the Town House on Monday evening we are determined to ensure they do not get away with this approach, which appears shambolic.Karla Green from the shop is handing out leaflets advising people about the public meeting but the times have changed so much even her leaflets are now out of date.She said: ldquoThey still have pm on them so we have to tell everyone that the time has changed ndash again.Project consultants WYG will be in attendance on Monday and will have a number of display boards showing the extent of proposals.Council transport officers will also be in the Town House and people will have the opportunity to ask questions.A council spokesperson said: ldquoThe public lsquodrop-inrsquo part is now -.pm and it has been extended due to securing availability of key members of the project team being available to answer public questions.ldquoInvitations to the stakeholdersrsquo meeting are for two representatives from a range of organisations involved in business transport in Haddington and confirmed invitees include Haddington Business Community Partnership, Haddington Community Development Trust, East Coast Buses, Prentice Coaches, Lothian Buses."},{"url":null,"title":"pair-travel-10k-wheelchairs-help-day-centre","story":"Megan Roland from Gford and Joanne Rye from Ormiston both completed the k journey from Ormiston to Tranent and back with help from their support workers.Through sponsorship they raised pound for Ormistonrsquos Primrose Day Centre.Megan, , and Joanne, , have support needs and have required the use of wheelchairs all their lives.They duo had assistance on the trek from their support workers Catherine Mitchell and Jackie Hoy.Joanne told the Courier: ldquoIt was exciting because Jackie, Megan and Cath did it with me and my niece and sister came along too.ldquoWe did it for Alzheimerrsquos as my mum has it and I wanted to do it for the Primrose Day Centre as she goes there.ldquoIt was a very successful and very fun sponsored walk.Megan and Joanne used to live together until Megan moved out to a house of her own.They have been on holidays together, including one memorable trip to Blackpool."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/10125244.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"gerry-cinnamon-announces-second-glasgow-hydro-gig-popular-demand","story":"The Castlemilk singer recently told how he is to play the SSE Hydro on December  following his insane TRNSMT set.This morning the venue confirmed a second leg of his Glasgow show the next night for December .EXTRA DATE ANNOUNCED FOR @GerryCinnamon!!

Like most of the country, the SNP did not believe Brexit would happen. It famously spent less money campaigning to stay in the EU than it did on a byelection in Glenrothes.However, as the main party of independence, it had to refer to a referendum somehow.So it arrived at a baroque, Brexit-related form of words that held out the possibility of independence, albeit in what it then considered highly improbable circumstances.The SNP then went backwards in . Although its constituency vote share rose .%, their regional share fell .%, and they fell from  MSPs to , losing their overall majority.A rum sort of basis for a mandate.Meanwhile, the Scottish Greens went off on their own tangent.Their  manesto had touted ldquoa multi-option referendum with choices including the status quo, a stronger Scottish Parliament with powers defined through a participative process, and full independence based on a written constitution.But by September , the Greens said the timing of Indyref, should no longer be the plaything of politicians.Instead it ldquoshould be determined by public appetitehellip For example, a call for a referendum signed by up to m people on the electoral register.Thus their  manesto said: ldquoIf a new referendum is to happen, it should come about by the will of the people, and not be driven by calculations of party political advantage. In such a referendum the Scottish Greens will campaign for independence.But there was never a petition.All of which gives Boris Johnson enough room to contest the validity of Ms Sturgeonrsquos mandate, at least until the  election comes round.

The listening, however, was not to the British people but Conservative grassroots, who effectively reinforced the view that there was nothing wrong with the partyrsquos policies they were simply not sold hard enough to an uncomprehending public.If Labour does the same, then it, like the Tories in  will be out of power for at least a decade or more.Last night, a rumour was doing the rounds at Westminster Boris Johnson would on Saturday venture to northern England to make a speech, underpinning his commitment to his new blue-collar constituency in what were former Labour heartlands.As the Oppositionrsquos soul-searching began, so too did the process for the bruised Liberal Democrats, whose own poor performance was encapsulated by the loss of their leader Jo Swinson. For the second time in four years, the Scot became the victim of an SNP surge.In her farewell address, Ms Swinson said she had been \"devastated\" by the election results, in which her party took just  seats, down by one on the partys  showing at the polls.But she insisted she did not \"regret trying\" to be the \"unapologetic voice of Remain\" and \"giving people the chance to choose to stop Brexit\".And yet it may well be the Lib Dem leadershiprsquos decision to aclaim it could go from  seats to  seats in one giant leap to form a majority government and bscrap Brexit altogether without another referendum put many voters off.Ms Swinson and her advisers had been warned at the partyrsquos autumn party conference from grandees like Simon Hughes and Norman Lamb that backing a policy to revoke Article  was a bad move it would push the centrist Lib Dems to an extreme position a mirror image of Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party.Even at the launch of the partyrsquos manesto in Camden, the leader began to row back on the prospect of a Lib Dem Government, lowering her sights to simply stopping the Conservatives getting a majority.And she later had to admit as the polls for her party went south, that the idea of her entering No  was ldquovery unlikely. Hubris, as always, was followed by nemesis.And so, like Labour, it looks like it will take many years for the Lib Dems to claw their way back to anything like the number of MPs they had under Paddy Ashdown, Charles Kennedy or Nick Clegg.All the zealous converts, Chuka Ummuna, Sam Gyimah and Luciana Berger failed to secure seats under the orange banner.With Ms Swinsonrsquos departure, Ed Davey, the deputy leader, and party President, Baroness Brinton, were quickly installed as their partyrsquos joint acting leaders.Interestingly, in her valedictory speech Ms Swinson name-checked all the partyrsquos experienced female MPs as possible successors: Sarah Olney Wera Hobhouse Christine Jardine and Layla Moran.ldquoWe will reflect, regroup and refresh,\" declared the former party leader.Having seen a Brexit-backing Conservative Party and the Scottish Nationalists make gains at the election, she warned of a \"resurgent Nationalism\" in the country and urged the party to \"foster hope\".She added: \"All of us who share an alternative vision for society have a responsibility to learn from these results and find new answers.

in a declaration thatrsquos enough to make you want to pour a very stf drink ndash a dram, preferably ndash our national drink has been declared as anything but.According to the makers of a new film that explores the cultural impact of whisky from its origins to modern times, whiskyrsquos Scottish roots would appear to be ever so slightly Irish.Asthat wasnrsquot enough to make whisky drinkers choke on their finest malt, therersquos even a very strong hint that our best-loved export might just have a slice of English DNA too.According to Glasgow-based whisky expert Dave Broom, who explores whiskyrsquos heritage in the film The Amber Light, and its producer Adam Park, there is ldquostrong evidence to suggest whisky may have been first developed in Ireland and brought to Islay, to be drunk at the seat of the High Kings.There, under the distilling expertise of one particular Irish family, the spirit is thought to have evolved into a tipple bearing at least a passing similarity to todayrsquos whisky.According to Mr Park, research carried out for the film suggests the Beaton family ndash Irish physicians who developed a vast international knowledge of botanical remedies ndash probably hold the key to the earliest forms of what would become the first Scotch whisky.ldquoThe Beatons were pretty amazing people, they travelled the world translating medical scripts and building their knowledge, he said.ldquoThey came to service of the High Kings and became experts in distilling spirit and added to it the plants and flowers that grew around them.The Beatons, whose family name appears as MacMeic-bethad and MacBeth, are thought to have arrived on Islay in the th century at the time of the marriage between Aine OrsquoCathain and Angus Og MacDonald, Lord Of The Isles.While there is no clear documentation to conclusively link the family to the origins of whisky, there are said to be clear signs their skills were almost certainly involved.Mr Park added: ldquoIt gets murky and therersquos not an accepted history of how whisky came about, but the best guess is the Beatons came to Islay when it was the seat of the High Kings who ruled huge parts of Scotland and Ireland.However, research for the film led to another twist: the English were probably already creating their own form of a dram at about the same time.Speaking to the , Mr Broom said: ldquoIf you look at the north of Ireland and across to Islay, thatrsquos the cradle of distillationhellip but the first record I found is in Chaucerrsquos Canterbury Tales.The Beaton family became hereditary physicians to the Scottish crown, serving Robert The Bruce and every subsequent Scottish king, while also providing medical knowledge to clan chiefs from the Western Isles to the Lowlands.They were known to make use of medicinal plants and traditional therapies at a time when others relied on superstition and myths as often ill-fated cures for illnesses and injuries.As word spread of their comforting drink, whisky stills spread across Scotland.Scotch whisky was first recorded on the Exchequer Rolls in  when a friar called John Cor, distiller at Lindores Abbey in Newburgh, Fe, and servant to the court of James IV, was noted to have made ldquoaqua vitae, VIII bolls of malt.While the Beatonrsquos fellow countrymen pursued distilling their own Irish whiskey, Mr Park says Scotsrsquo ingenious methods of circumventing taxes and American prohibition laws ndash when Scotch was allowed as a ldquomedicinal product ndash helped embed whisky as the premium spirit.Later, shrewd marketing practices with their focus on Highland history and heritage, saw whisky overwhelm its Irish and American cousins and lay foundations for todayrsquos pound. billion export market.The film, which is currently touring cinemas across the country, also explores how whisky has become embedded in Scottish culture yet is constantly evolving to attract new generations of drinkers.That, he adds, includes cocktails and mixers that shatter whiskyrsquos traditional ldquogentleman in tweeds image ndash such as Lagavulin mixed with Coke, dubbed a Smokey Cokey.ldquoLike any commercial enterprise, whisky needs to attract new customers, says Mr Park. ldquoThe image of the stuffy old man in a leather armchair in the library having an undiluted single malt is still there, but itrsquos also not there.A spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said: ldquoThe earliest known record of Scotch Whisky production dates from the Exchequer Rolls of , but it is likely the lsquoAqua Vitaersquo was being produced long before this date.ldquoIt is likely early development of distillation in Scotland and Ireland took place in parallel, ultimately leading to two distinct global

Yet, on the eve of polling, the party had been confidently talking up gains to the media.At a joint event with her successor Jackson Carlaw, former leader Ruth Davidson had said she wanted to see her party take seats off the SNP.ldquoIrsquove not just been spending time in the seats that we hold trying to defend them, Irsquove been spending time in seats that wersquore trying to take, she said.In the end, the party went backwards in  of its  seats.The Tories did better on the offensive, increasing their vote in Lanark  Hamilton East, Ayrshire Central and Argyll  Bute, but by small or pitul amounts.They slumped in the ultra-marginal target of Perth  North Perthshire, where the SNPrsquos Pete Wishart had a majority of . He was ed with a majority of ,.The SNP increased their vote across the board.It was a stark contrast to , when Scotland had been the one bright spot for the Tories.Then, Scotland had been the only source of Tory gains, as the party under Ms Davidson picked up  seats and gaveTheresa May the numbers she needed to stay in power. The partyrsquos vote share increased by .%, double the rise across the UK.But at this election, Scotland provided the worst Tory result. The only nation in which the party lost MPs or vote share was Scotland.The Scottish campaign was based on making Ms Sturgeon and the SNP synonymous with Indyref in the belief Labour voters would vote tactically to protect the Union.But it turned out Labour voters preferred voting tactically to help the SNP get rid of Tories.The party knew Boris Johnson and Brexit werenrsquot going down well ndash they latterly airbrushed the PM out of their campaign ndash but thought Ms Sturgeon was even less popular.Their own animosity to ldquothat effing woman proved a blindspot. A big headache for the Scottish Tories is that this election was supposed to be the prelude to their Holyrood campaign of .The party was hoping to build up support and convert it into gains on the regional lists. Butit starts losing constituencies, those MSPs will wash up on the list as consolation wins under the proportional voting system and make net gains will be harder.One bleak omen for Mr Carlaw is that the Tory share of the vote fell almost  points in avowedly Remain East Renfrewshire, while the SNPrsquos rose . points. Now a born-again Leaver, Mr Carlaw represents the equivalent seat at Holyrood.A similar swing to the SNP in  would overturn his ,-vote majority, sending him back to the West of Scotland list. The one possible upside for the Scottish Tories is the election may lead to an injection of new blood at Holyrood, as defeated MPs look to Edinburgh for a new berth, clearing out some of the dead timber.Butthe results were bad for the Tories and their campaign against Indyref, they were truly atrocious for Scottish Labour. Despite its precarious hold on the electoral map ndash four of the seven seats it was defending had majorities below , ndash the party was predicting it wouldnine MPs just hours before the polls closed.It was over-confidence based on positive canvas s. In Glasgow North East, Paul Sweeney publicly predicted he would increase his -vote majority on the back of glowing canvas data.After the massive YouGov poll on Tuesday predicting a Tory landslide, the partyrsquos digital chief Aidan Kerr tweeted: ldquoGlasgow North East is not going to the SNP. Andthe pollsters think this, then God knows what  they have got wrong.Mr Sweeney lost to the SNPrsquos Anne McLaughlin by , votes. It was a profound failure of the party machine that points to deep, systemic problems. The party reckoned it was making a comeback in its old heartlands of Glasgow and North Lanarkshire.But when the results came in, Labour lost vote share in every Glasgow seat and in all its North Lanarkshire targets as well. In fact, Labour lost a bigger slice of its vote share in Scotland than anywhere  in the UK, down . points to a wretched .%, thanks to the loss of , votes.Its sole MP north of the Border is Ian Murray in Edinburgh South, who did not hesitate to blame Mr Corbyn for the partyrsquos desperate decline. Mr Leonard has now lost two elections in a year.Last night he vowed to lead his party into the  election as well. His opponents will be chuffed.The LibDems, despite losing Ms Swinson, were the steadiest party of the night. It gained North East Fe to stay on four MPs, increasing its share of the vote by . points.The upshot of it all is Ms Sturgeon will ramp up demands for Indyref. Mr Johnson called her last night to get his refusal in early. Because whatrsquos in it for him  If he granted a Section  order, despite his ldquoguarantee not do so, it would cause turmoil in his party.He also knows referendums bring down leaders. Ask David Cameron, Theresa May and Alex Salmond. Mr Johnson has no appetite to bring his premiership to an early end by granting and then losing Indyref.Perhaps most compelling for a politician who seems to care for little but himself, defeat would mean going down in the history books as the last Prime Minister of the UK, the man who made himself Minister for the Union then oversaw its break-up. It is not a legacy he would savour."},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeenshire council ensures a clear route for voters","story":"Final preparations are being made by Aberdeenshire Council to ensure voters have a clear route as they head for the polls later this week.With the General Election taking place on Thursdaythe Roads, Landscape and Waste Service has been reviewing its winter service arrangements and preparing a contingency plan which can be implemented in the event of severe weather occurring in the days before or during polling day.The service has been working closely with the council’s election team in the preparation of the plan which includes scenario planning for dferent levels of severe weather events, how that might impact on access to polling stations and what resources would be required in order to respond to severe weather.At this time, no specic information has been issued by the Met Office suggesting particularly severe weather, with Wednesday forecast to be largely dry with some light snow on very high ground from noon on Thursday through to midnight.

It means less energy and less space is needed to treat a higher quantity of waste water, reducing the operating costs of the site. It also removes the need to chemically treat the effluent, increasing the protection of the rivers Don and Urie, and provides the capacity to support the local community as it continues to grow and flourish. The project was delivered by Scottish Water alliance partner ESD and included building new sewer pipework, improving the resilience of the site to flooding and upgrading existing equipment. Ms Gougeon said: “While treating waste water isn’t something people probably like to think about too often, it is something that is absolutely vital to protect not only our health and sanitation, but also the environment. “Developing new, more efficient ways of treating waste water through the deployment of new technology, is hugely important as Scotland takes decisive steps towards tackling the climate emergency we are facing around the world.” Chief Executive of Scottish Water Douglas Millican said: “We are always looking for ways to innovate and protect the environment both locally and globally, so it is very exciting to see this new state-of-the-art treatment works officially opened here in Inverurie – the first of its kind in Scotland. “Not only does it mean we can continue to treat waste water effectively and protect the environment for years to come, it also underlines our commitment to pursue new ways to lower our energy requirements, towards reaching our ambitious goal of achieving net zero emissions by .” Most construction work on site was completed in the Spring and the new treatment process has since been closely monitored during commissioning and beyond.While most of the work took place within the established Scottish Water site, installation of new pipework beneath the railway line involved a closure to Keithhall Road which was completed ahead of schedule in April .data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A group of Logie Durno Primary School pupils taking part in the Wee Sleep Out\"  Wee Sleep Out at Logie Durno School viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"ESD Chief Operating Officer Wendy Cooper said: “We are very proud of what has been achieved at Inverurie, successfully delivering a cutting edge new wastewater treatment technology in Scotland for the first time. “Success in this project has involved close collaboration between Scottish Water, ESD, Royal HaskoningDHV and our wider supply chain.

That is where the terms of the trade deal between the UK and the EU will be agreed.“For NFUS, ensuring as free and as frictionless trade in agri-food goods with the EU, which remains our principal market outside of the UK, has been our priority from the start of this process.“Whether negotiating with the EU, or establishing new trade deals with other countries worldwide, a red line for us is that Scotland’s high standards must be recognised and protected.“Our members can be reassured that their union has begun engagement with this new parliament today and we will make tracks to Westminster at the earliest opportunity as we enter a new era for Scottish farming and crofting.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Indeed, Ministers have stopped even referring to the deadline,” Mr McArthur said.“It is all the more important, therefore, that priority is given to connecting those communities who have been waiting longest for any sort of service. Good quality, affordable broadband is increasingly critical in accessing services, allowing businesses to compete and enable people to go about their daily lives.#The Orkney MSP added: #Mr Matheson seems happy that Orkney continues to languish signicantly behind the level of coverage achieved nationally. As an MSP representing a central belt constituency, perhaps Mr Matheson believes this is just the ‘price you pay’ for living in an island or rural area.“Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable, the Scottish Government needs to re-commit to prioritising future broadband investment in Orkney and other communities who continue to lag behind when it comes to coverage.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Meanwhile in Scotland, the SNP’s result was arguably even more remarkable with the party securing  out of  seats. Not quite , but still that means  per cent of Scotland’s MPs are Nationalists.However, their result was achieved on the basis of  per cent of the vote in Scotland and the Tories won . across the UK, so both these ‘majorities’ are actually based on ‘minorities’ and a product of the first-past-the-post system.Amid their understandably triumphant celebrations, Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon now appear to be on a political collision course over a second independence referendum, a bitter and isive constitutional clash of epic proportions.: Jackson Carlaw promises Scottish unionists: We can still stop indyref: Nicola Sturgeon: Indyref is ‘democratic right of the Scottish people’However, they could attempt to take a dferent course, one of humility and respect for the dferent viewpoints of these two political tribes.As he ed to  Downing Street, Boris Johnson said the UK “deserves a break from wrangling, a break from politics”, adding: “I urge everyone to find closure and to let the healing begin.”And he is right about the need for healing. The UK is still ided along Leave Remain lines while, for all Johnson and fellow unionists might wish it to be so, the large number of people who support Scottish independence are unlikely to simply give up. And there are other signicant ides in the UK – between left and right, with newly enthused activists on both sides of the spectrum young and old urban and rural areas north and south – that are problems for our society.Rule by London diktatThe key questions are whether Johnson is serious about trying to heal the country or whether this is rhetoric in preparation for the looming fight with the SNP andSturgeon actually has an interest in joining in such a process, rather than stoking ision as part of efforts to secure independence.ButScotland does ever leave the UK, it is most assuredly in its interests to maintain good relations with its nearest and dearest neighbour, just as it is in the UK’s interests to maintain good relations with the EU. Indeed, this would almost certainly be vital to making a success of an independent Scotland. So it would be a mistake for the SNP to dismiss Johnson’s victory and his pledge to stop a second referendum. Political promises should be hard to break, particularly for a Prime Minister with a reputation for being, perhaps, too ‘economical with the actualité’.And, likewise, it would be a mistake for Johnson to add to the sense of nationalist grievance by acting in a high-handed way that could be portrayed as rule by London diktat.They may not like it, in fact, they may absolutely hate it, but they might be better advised to seek some form of compromise, to find an acceptable middle ground.Quite what that would be is hard to say. But it could be more powers for Scotland or perhaps an agreement to allow a second indyrefthe SNP wins the next Holyrood election. Some commentators believe it would be politically untenable to deny a second voteSturgeon wins in that is the case, it might make more sense for Johnson to allow it and focus on ensuring an SNP defeat, rather than rail against it, only to later concede.Smart politics is not always about being tough. There are powerful forces that could easily push them into an increasingly bitter conflict but, surely, in the long run, that would be in no one’s interest.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"gary rhodes a pioneer who inspired so many young cooks tributes pour in for tv chef","story":"Described as a pioneer who \"inpsired many young cooks\" and the man who \"almost single handedly put British food on the world stage\", Rhodes was one of the best known ambassadors for British cuisine and inspired a generation of Brits to enjoy cooking. window.twttr The top chef, who received five Michelin stars during his career, he is best known for his work on MasterChef, Ready Steady Cook and Hells Kitchen.

She followed Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn#s position, stating she would like to see a new Brexit deal negotiated with the EU and put to the British people in a referendum, with no Brexit the other option.Jenner Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, said her priority was to #uphold democracy# and to see Brexit through #as soon as possible#.The SNP#s Robert Leslie said that Orkney and Shetland had not voted for Brexit yet #we could suffer most# from the country leaving the EU. He added he would like to remain in the EU and help reform it from within as part of an independent Scotland.The Brexit Party#s Robert Smith did not attend, but his stance of a #clean-break Brexit# with a free trade deal with the EU was announced to the room.Unsurprisingly, Brexit proved the hottest topic of the evening with several questions based around that subject.Ms Fairbairn, the Conservative candidate, surprised most in attendance by repeatedly going against party policy # firstly by saying she supported the actions of Gina Miller, who took the Conservative government to court over Brexit, because she was #upholding democracy# and secondly by saying that the government#s #settled status# scheme for EU citizens needed a #total overhaul#.So it would seem the only candidate willing to represent the more than nine and a half thousand brexit voters in Orkney and Shetland is working fisherman Robert Smith of the Brexit party. It would seem Boris promise that all tories elected in this election would back his brexit plan was a bit of the mark. Or maybe it shows that his brexit plan is not brexit at alltheir candidate For the isles is willing to back it.Good to see that the Brexit Party is not drawn into this level of debate. I am sure Robert Smith was absent because he was busy getting Brexit Done. Too right that a clean-break Brexit is what we need. Like was said before, a free trade deal will be the #easiest in human history#. Wise words from Liam Fox, and still yet to be disproved by the #facts#.Robert Leslie, SNP, is obviously unaware ofthe impact of independence. The EU has stated repeatedly that , wewill be automatically out of the EU on Independence Day # with #No Deal#.#When part of the territory of a Member State ceases to be a part of that State, e.g. because that territory becomes an independent state, the treaties will no longer apply #Westminster will no longer fund our #notional budget deficit#. It will become real. Nicola Sturgeon#s Scottish Growth Commission proposed a multi-year plan to reduce it to EU-acceptable levels. We must also have our own, independent central bank and therefore, our own currency. That will take nine yearsand will require tens of billions in foreign reserves.If Britain #remains# there would be a #hard UK border# with EU tarfs . Negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster.It will take at least  years, with austerity,to rejoin.And  when we do we shall join the euro and pass control of our economy trade and fishing agriculture to the EU.SNP EU Brexit policy is nonsense.

Nobody will know more about the negative effects of European Union membership than you!I#m a bit baffled.

It will even take place within the SNP itself, once the phoney pre-independence “party of national unity” approach falls apart.During these debates, the left will highlight support for Corbyn’s radical policies as evidence that these are still relevant and can still win votes.Meanwhile, the right will highlight the lack of support for Labour as evidence that strong unions and public ownership are no longer winning policies and should be abandoned forever.If you can’t use your vote to get your candidate elected tomorrow, at lease use it to make a statement.The ideas behind Labour’s bold policies need to be kept alive.They will be as relevant in an independent Scotland as they will anywhere .Absolutely.Absolutely not, Johan. I am old enough to remember the Winter of Discontent. Comrade Corbyn, Comrade Scargill. First Secretary Sturgeon! Reach for the rusty tin, self-castration before I would vote Socialist or Nationalist.I am almost old enough to remember the s also. I went missing from hom when I wis about , because I was busy helping a couple of older folk collect fire wood in the absence of coal during the Tories  day week I think.We are not going back to the s, with what we know now we can run things much better under Corbyn.The absence of coal was due to Socialist and le long Soviet supporterMick McGahey#s miners strike. Hardly down to the Tories. Just the Unions holding the country to ransom. Thank God the Maggie neutered that bunch.It#s almost like you are saying Shetland needs a vocal and united local Labour Party willing to take a stand on environmental and equality issues and prepared to ensure people#s concerns are properly considered.Will the local branch make a start to rebuilding by considering whether it isn#t time to call an end to Sullom Voe Yes, it would be goodmembers stopped voting for other partiesIt#s almost like you are trying to change the subject. Which of the parties that plan to close Sullom Voe did you vote for It’s important that unions be strong but not omnipotent, as in the s when many major industries were still nationalised. We meed balance.Combining the two is all very fine for those who, like me, benefited from working in the public sector however it leads to a two-tier workforce, with those in the private sector footing the bill, in taxes or high product prices, for the privileged ones in the public sector. That also hits private sector pay as employers must maintain viability with their increased costs.Having said that, re-nationalisation of electricity would be hilariously apt because government would become directly accountable totaxpayers and or bill-payers for the soaring costs of energy arising from “decarbonisation”, associated with the lunacy of unilateral “declarations of climate emergency” and policies like Labour’s “net zero ”.The IPCC does not call for that and condemns unilateral action as being unhelpful in achieving international agreement.I voted for Blair when sanity prevailed,now Corbyn takes us all back, well he is trying to, but the result empowers Boris!!! So now we have a Boris   Sturgeon catfight. Interesting times ahead, perhaps an Independent Shetland is the way forward, history repeating.Agreed Johan, and Labour has had my vote this time, but when there is a chance of turffing out an austerity backing LibDem# The main thing is people are being offered a chance to take back control of the vital services they depend on that should never have been privatised in the first place.New management systems will mean these can in future serve the people rather than serving corporate greed.Whether we get there this election or not, Corbin#s bold ideas have reignited the debate and energised thousands more activists than the Tories have active members. Hope remains for a fairer society in which the economy works for the good of the people as well as the environment they depend on.The LibDems on the other hand remain forever compromised between the freedom of business to exploit people and the freedom of people not to be exploited.

Mr Dunlop was one of four elders, and the minister is Rev David Silversides.He added he was not prepared to go into details, as the matter could have legal implications. But the Upper Bann website claims, “The matter spiralled out of control, when Biblical and church procedures were ignored. Spurious ‘discipline’ was enacted against a number of members and it was impossible for some to continue.” The upshot was that Mr Dunlop was excommunicated. He and another elder moved out, with  members, “for the sake of the peace of the Loughbrickland congregation”. The website adds, “As it is an ongoing controversy, still before the ecclesiastical courts – elements of which my come before the civil courts – we refrain from presenting details at present.” The website claims that members excluded from Loughbrickland were denied “constitutional redress within the RPCI”, and they decided to move to Portadown, and set up the first Covenanters Church in the town.The Watson Centre was available and they moved in earlier this month, with ‘Upper Bann Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland ’ sign on the gable wall. Rev David Silversides, who has been minister at Loughbrickland for around  years, confirmed that Mr Dunlop had been excommunicated by the church.

Trees decorated or sponsored by local people, churches, organisations and businesses will delight , while musicians and singers will play live Christmas music on the hour. Take a seat, close your eyes, pray and invite God to bring you into not ‘that Christmassy feeling’ but the deep joy that comes from knowing Him through Jesus Christ.There will be a number of points where guets can interact with the trees – for instance add to the decorations of a tree with your own words of joy and thanksgiving, post prayer requests for personal needs and other situations around the world at the Prayer Tree, and use the Blue Christmas ‘remembering’ tree to remember those whose presence we miss due to distance or death. A Kids’ Craft room will be open for children to take some time to also engage with the theme of Christmas Joy.When you’ve spent some time taking in the Christmas forest, head through the link corridor to the new hall, where hot drinks and festive treats will be served.

It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"meabha puts irish women in the frame","story":"AN intricate painting is proving to be much more than meets the eye in its celebration of Irish women and their place in the world.Entitled Mná hÉireann Women of Ireland, the painting was created by West Belfast artist Meabha Magerr. The striking piece was commissioned by go-to Andersonstown physiotherapist Dan Turley, taking pride of place in his home.Meabha, originally from Inishmore Crescent, now based across the water, told the Andersonstown News that her interest and talent in art flourished ever since “I could hold a crayon”.“In our household, thankfully, you were allowed to be who and what you were. I passed my -Plus and wanted to go to the school around the corner and that was St Genevieve’s. I had always had a love of painting and came from an artistic, creative family.”Friends since they were teenagers, Dan commissioned Meabha, who has displayed her work at the annual Féile an Phobail artists showcase in St Mary’s University College, to create Mná hÉireann.“My biggest problem was finding the right face, the central figure in this case of the piece, to signy le force and strength. I had painted a portrait of Clannad’s Moya Brennan before and I just kept coming back to her face, especially with her being a Celtic woman, a setter of pace. I did change it slightly, the hair, the colour of the eyes, I wanted to convey the feel of her, not necessarily a repeat portrait,” she said.She continued: “I’ve known Dan since I was , we have a lot of banter. He’s a Michelangelo man and just to annoy him I painted the ‘Da Vinci rose’ in it,” she laughed. “There are forget-me-nots in the painting and fuschias, deora Dé God’s tears, as I’d imagine he’d cry to see the persecution women have and continue to face at the injustices in the world.“Dan was very clear that he wanted only positives in the piece, no negatives.”Contained in Mná hÉireann are leaves of ious sizes withnames on them of women from throughout history in delicate gold lettering, and not immediately obvious.“I spent time researching and wanted to go beyond the obvious,” explained Meabha. “Countess Markievicz is there, my great aunt Nano Mullan is on it who fought alongside Countess Markievicz, Sonia O’Sullivan is there. The names are quite hard to read and that was deliberate, as throughout history women haven’t always been seen. They’ve had to come through back doors, pretend to be less than they were.”The prolic artist said the painting and the names contained in it have proved quite the talking point.“James Barry is on it. A woman who wanted to join the Irish army as a military surgeon and disguised herself as a man to do.”James Barry became a pioneering surgeon who carried out the first successful Caesarean delivery.Meabha spoke of how “not all the contributions, the names are immediately obvious”.“Sinéad Burke is there, Sinéad who is three-and-a-half foot tall, a Dublin-based teacher, PhD student and activist. When I first read about her, I nearly skimmed past the article, which was about the fashion industry. I love style but have no interest in fashion. I soon realised the article wasn’t about fashion in that sense, it was about inclusion – a much bigger topic and much more far reaching in many areas of le.“There are olives painted in the portrait, in dferent stages of development which are symbolizing peace. Some are ripe, some aren’t, the meaning behind this is that this is an ongoing stage, peace is a circle of work that will never end, we are always going to have to work hard for it.“I’m glad that the painting is proving to be such a talking point in Dan’s house. It’s as much about learning in that you pick a name and find out more, there is meaning behind each chosen colour, flower and there are emeralds, in this particular case placed in the Celtic crown to represent the four green fields.“The ring formation of the wreath signies everlasting protection. I didn’t want to follow the trend of portraying a warrior queen, that has been well covered by many fabulous artists. I wanted to make this piece more personal.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"voters go to polls for westminster election","story":"POLLING stations have opened across the North in the General Election. candidates are competing for  Westminster seats.Polling stations opened at am and will close at pm with results expected to be finalised early on Friday morning.A total of ,, people are eligible to vote across the north.North Belfast is expected to witness one of the tightest contests, between DUP’s Nigel Dodds and Sinn Féin’s John Finucane, with Nuala McAllister of Alliance the other candidate on the ballot paper.In South Belfast, SDLP’s Claire Hanna is the bookies favourite to oust outgoing DUP MP Emma Little-Pengelly.

Back in  he represented the area as mayor, later becoming its MLA.Twelve years later he is now the constituencys MP - a triumph for Alliance which few political pundits would have been comfortable betting their money on until yesterday, with most predicting the seat was there for the DUPs taking.Dr Farrys Westminster win is no mean feat - voters held his successor, the independent unionist Lady Sylvia Hermon, in huge affection. Like Lady Hermon, he is a firm Remainer, and during his campaign he was keen to stress their shared Brexit position.A Queens University graduate in Politics with a PhD in International Relations, Dr Farry is only the second Alliance politician to be elected to Westminster in its history.A fitting development, perhaps, given the Newtownards man is arguably Alliances second most high-profile name, behind leader Naomi Long.During his tenure in the Executive, he served as minister for employment and learning, and gained widespread praise for capping tuition fees in September . Following the  Assembly elections, he took up positions on the Stormont Committee for the Economy and Business Committee, positions he held until the collapse of power-sharing in .His political work has also garnered global attention: in  he was appointed an International Peace Scholar by the US Institute of Peace. The -year-old has always been a passionate advocate of Alliances cross-community ethos, but he himself has been caught in the crossfire of Northern Irelands green and orange politics.In , after fellow party members on Belfast City Council voted in favour of restricting the flying of the Union flag at City Hall to specic days throughout the year, his own constituency office in Bangor was the target of an attempted arson attack. But with Alliances gains in this latest election, Dr Farry will be hoping it indicates potential for growing the middle ground in local politics. *Stephen Farry was not available for an interview yesterday.Stephen FarryAllianceNorth DownWon by: , votesBrexit: Remain"},{"url":null,"title":"how the political pacts played out","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Green Party also pulled out to maximise the anti-Brexit vote in the constituency.The arrangements sparked controversy. IRA abuse victim Mairia Cahill resigned from the SDLP, calling it a ‘grubby sectarian pact’.

It said DUP , Sinn Fein , Alliance , SDLP  and UUP .Close, but not quite the cigar and while I did not do a GB forecast, the scale of the Corbyn catastrophe far exceeded that expected even by those of us long cynical concerning his capabilities.Understandably, the widely trumpeted headline is that unionist MPs will provide only a minority of Northern Irelands Westminster representatives, for the first time ever.The DUP came perilously close to being wiped out in Belfast amid a three-pronged attack from Sinn Fein, the SDLP and Alliance.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetBut as late as Thursday morning, the DUP was still very hopeful of holding North Belfast. I saw some of the bets that had been struck.Arlene Foster was neither wrong nor sectarian in blaming the grievous blow of losing Nigel Dodds on changing demographics.Lamenting a pan-nationalist pact will not wash, though, given the pressure placed upon Steve Aikens UUP to step aside in North Belfast.Even without a pact, Claire Hanna would almost certainly have won South Belfast for the SDLP.The  high water mark was always going to be dficult to defend. It is also worth remembering that DUP vote shares have risen more often in elections under Fosters stewardship than they have fallen.The DUP remains Northern Irelands largest party. data-dfpadtargetingThe DUPs Alex Easton is consoled by his we DeniseThat said, previous successes owed something to UUP weakness and Thursdays Belfast and North Down failures, along with several reduced majorities where, increase the pressure upon her leadership.Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who saw his own constituency turn into a semi-marginal, is the obvious Westminster replacement leader for Dodds. His remit might ultimately be extended.Meanwhile, Alliances time has come.The partys voted soared by nearly %, to add to the % European election increase and % in the council contests.It is Alliances best year. This surge is causing problems for the UUP, searching for niche pro-Union distinctiveness, but Alliances extra vote is also coming from those who do not identy as unionist or nationalist. And that is a big and expanding reservoir in which Alliance can fish. What of Sinn Fein  It got the scalp it wanted with the Dodds decapitation and ended the election with the same number of MPs as it started.Yet overall performance was mediocre at best and occasionally poor.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood handed out a thrashing in Foyle probably beyond his own expectations, let alone anyone s. This in a city where Sinn Fein had staged its ard fheis, launched its manesto and brought in hundreds of volunteers in the last month. Sinn Feins % fall in vote share - even allowing for its non-participation in some constituencies - is part of a broader pattern of generally indferent recent election performances.While a Boris Brexit will now assist the party in establishing economic structures of unication and in effect special status for The North, it seems inconceivable that the Conservative Government will permit a border poll. There is no obvious short-or medium-term route to constitutional unity. The Prime Ministers immediate preoccupation will be somehow attempting to quell the burning independence fires in Scotland.While the success of the SDLP in Foyle will reawaken criticisms of Sinn Feins abstention from Westminster, it is unclear why.The grim truth for even the participatory victorious local MPs is that they will carry precious little clout at Westminster.They might enjoy the sights but not the politics.If the PM could discard the DUP so brutally when it held the balance of power, why would he listen to the pleas of  MPs who offer zero threat to his -seat majority So abstention may remain a non-issue within Sinn Fein. Evenit could be proved beyond doubt that abstention was harming Sinn Feins electoral fortunes, the party leadership would be wary of touching the issue.A two-thirds majority of members would be needed for change and risks a split. And anyone who thinks a split in the republican movement does not have its problems has slept through the last century.If locally elected politicians want power, they will need to restore Stormont.That is a possible outcome of Thursdays results.Sinn Fein would have a power base. The DUP might take the view that an Irish Language Act, in broader form, is the bitter pill that needs swallowing to avoid the grim vista of power being confined to local councils for at least half a generation.But such DUP willingness would be conditional upon them being still the largest party and providing the first minister after the next set of elections to the phantom Assembly, presumably in spring.Ready for yet more hot contests then Jon Tonge is Professor of Politics at the University of Liverpool and Principal Investigator of the ESRC  Northern Ireland election study"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38780628.ece/ac386/BINARY/POLITIC%201843.jpg","title":"south belfast proved to be a hard seat for dup to hold","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

With strong community activism roots, she had been a city councillor for  years and became the first mayor of the newly created Derry City and Strabane District Council.Mrs McCallion was one of seven Sinn Fein MPs who were elected to Westminster as abstentionist politicians, therefore she never took her seat on the green benches and didnt vote on the crucial Brexit votes that passed through parliament since her election to the post.Her time as MP was not without its controversy. In the days following her shock victory, reports surfaced of alleged voting fraud which was investigated, but no prosecutions came from the claims.In her first weeks in the job, she commented that her hotel room in London was \"smaller than her bathroom at home\", causing a wave of criticism. Just last month she was called on to apologise after claims she insulted residents in deprived areas of the constituency, by allegedly telling them via a live video while canvassing that they could open their doors as she \"was not a debt collector\".Yesterday she congratulated Derrys new MP, Colum Eastwood, and vowed to continue working for her city.\"Congratulations Colum on your impressive victory,\" she wrote on her Facebook page. \"I look forward to working with you in the future.

The collaboration between Balenciaga and Nuriev reimagines a sofa — the center of so many homes — as an example of environmentally conscious design, giving generations of garments and other materials another le. The oblong sofa — inspired by typical overstuffed recliners — is upholstered with damaged or otherwise unsellable garments and off-cuts from obsolete stocks of Balenciaga clothing, encased by scrapped transparent vinyl. Patterns, cuts, and tags within the stuffing are recognizably Balenciaga, a mix of past seasons and ideas. Intended to encourage sustainable practices within design and where, the piece reflects Balenciaga’s recognition of the responsibility designers have to counterbalance their environmental impact, and dedication to implementing programs that upcycle waste and contribute to a circular economy.

In the first instance, we urge all players to read in detail the full report from the GAA’s Fixtures Review Taskforce. Key principles agreed by the GPA and CPA are based upon the fundamental understanding that inter-county players are also club players and that this connection is the basis of the GAA. These are:  The club is the primary basic unit of the GAA from which everything springs. Therefore, this must be recognised in the status which club games are given. googletag.cmd.push  The inter-county game is the GAA’s biggest promotional and developmental tool. It is also the GAA’s primary revenue generator. This must be fully recognised in restructuring our national games calendar. Furthermore, both organisations are in agreement that, following the recent publication of the Fixtures Calendar Review Taskforce report, and prior to the next phase in that process which includes a series of regional seminars in which all key stakeholders will be provided with the opportunity to provide further views and feedback, there are a number of key points centred around time and governance that we mutually support and wish to highlight. googletag.cmd.push These are:  The Club Window in April May should be ened to a -week period to allow the fairest opportunity for the window to be successfully utilised.  The demands placed upon inter-county players in both club and inter-county windows will need to be governed to ensure the games training load is not detrimental to the players’ welfare.  The Club Window post the All-Ireland football final needs to be a minimum of  weeks before provincial club championships begin.  Club Windows will only work fairly for all,inter county competitions start their championships on the same dates.  There needs to be stronger adherence to provisions regarding the availability of inter-county players to clubs as referenced within GPA Squad Charters.  Bar club teams involved in provincial championships November should be used exclusively as an off season for inter-county players.  There needs to be strong governance and guidelines introduced to ensure club fixtures schedules are appropriately set out and adhered to throughout the year. “One of our core pillars is to protect the welfare of our members, statedPaul Flynn, GPA CEO. It is therefore vital that fixtures are properly governed to ensure the fundamental link between club and inter-county players is fully recognised and strengthened within the fixtures calendar. “This year we put a motion before GAA Congress to provide for a GPA representative to sit on the Central Competitions Control Committee to input on fixtures involving inter-county hurling and football competitions only, in a bid to improve the situation for our members.” “We will work towards this with the CPA, while prioritising the welfare of our members, keeping in focus the amount of games they are expected to play and amount of training they are expected to undertake.” Micheacuteal Briody, Chairman of the CPA, admitted that both the GPA and CPA have agreed the the current fixtures calendar isnt the best fit for both sets of players. “The CPA have advocated for a radical structural change to the fixtures calendar since our formation in , Briody commented. It is important now that the options for change put forward from the Task Force are disseminated to clubs immediately so that the debate can begin nationwide on what level of change is acceptable.” “We will work to ensurethis communication does happen effectively and it is criticalthat all clubs become aware of the options that are being presented and then vote for change that will alleviate the current unsatisfactory schedule.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I knew him from gigs and as a customer of Cool Discs when I worked there. More than that though I felt I knew him more through other people’s recollections of him and to deliver the eulogy I give you me and Mickey’s friends.Joe Brown said: “Derry sadly lost a man you don’t meet every day. There was nothing lying beneath, no agendas, no jagged edges. “A rock solid partner to Breige and an inspirational man of music, art and literature. I saw his band Idol Threat with The Undertones a number of times and became friends with him in the early s, going to gigs. “People were drawn to him and the inspirational effect he had on them. I heard so many bands for the first time through his record collection. I’ll always remember Mickey as a man who embraced le and had an incredible gt of bringing people together, loved a party and kept me from going sane Derry feels like a dferent place without him, every now and then nature conjures up someone very unique and special, who so many had barrels of affection for and who’ll be sadly missed by us all”.Mickey Rooney said: “His flat was always open to the outsiders, his heart was open to all no matter what creed or colour and his mind was always open to whatever experiences came his way”.Raymond Gorman said: “There was definitely no one like him, it took real guts to dress as a punk back in the day, it was a very violent time, Mickey was fearless and hated bullies. The last time I spoke to him he was enthusing about his latest music pourchases and gigs he’d been to. I think he’d be annoyed with everyone being too sad about his passing, remember him with the smile he put on your face when you met him”.Louise McIntyre said: “I first knew Mickey as a teenager growing up in the Brandywell, he was in my older brother’s class in school, I never actually got to talk to him back then as he was a quiet sort. “My earliest memory is looking across at Mickey’s backyard flat roof extension roof and seeing him lying up there with a small radio to his ear listening to his music, even then I knew he was dferent   cool. Several years later we crossed paths again and became a true friend he was doing best man at our wedding. He always remembered birthdays and special occasions. “Mickey stood head and shoulders above everyone  in more ways than one. He was an inspiration and a Derry legend. I somehow hope that he knew this, and that Derry will be an emptier place without him. Thanks for the memories Mickey xx”.Liz Brown said: “One of lasting memories Ill carry of Mickey was his genuine love and kindness towards his friends and loved ones. Like gravity, Mickey had an unseen force that pulled people together and kept their feet on the ground”.Paul McCartney paid a touching tribute in the Journal the day of Mickey’s funeral. “As the s began, you’d usually touch base with Mickey in the town centre on a Saturday. He had a band called The Idol Threats and soon the band I played in, Graffiti, ended up regularly supporting them. I don’t think I saw a local group as musically adventurous until That Petrol Emotion came along. It was a million miles apart from The Undertones and The Moondogs and Mickey was crucial to this process. He wasn’t just the drummer - he was the lyricist also. Just as the music was very involving and mysterious, so, too, were the words and song titles - ‘Lonely Beach Now, ‘Postcard from Abroad’ and the legendary ‘Little Green Men on The Moon.Mickey was a kind and generous guy, but also grateful and reciprocal for everything he received. He remembered everyone’s birthday and was always there with a card or gt. He constantly exuded a spirit of fun and that amazing sense of humour of his was just non-stop and incredible - you simply didn’t know what would come next.“Politics  He didn’t do them, and they did not happen in the many get-togethers in his legendary Abercorn Place flat. I think I can genuinely describe him as an “Enemy of Sectarianism”. When Mickey was cruelly affected by ill health in recent years, this sense of civility never eroded. So lucky are many of us for having this wonderful and inspirational human being around for many years”. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The origin tale of the lake, known as ‘The Death of Eochaidh son of Mairid’ is over a thousand years old in oral tradition, but has now been brought up to date in a new telling by children’s author, Maacuteire Zepf.Liacute Ban’s story is tale bursting with colour, from giant horses and ancient gods to mermaids and monks. It tells of a young girl who is transformed into a mermaid when a magical curse floods their ringfort, creating Lough Neagh Six Irish-medium primary schools in the Mid-Ulster area have been working on the story with Maacuteire Zepf over the past months, writing their own creative responses and drawing original illustrations for the story.The young writers and illustrators from Dungannon, Coalisland, Magherafelt, Ballinascreen, Cookstown and Tirkane then came together at the Seamus Heaney HomePlace in Bellaghy on th December for a collaborative showcase performance of their work, to celebrate the project and to hear the story told in its entirety.The story of Liacute Ban is deeply rooted in the locality of the area, mentioning local places by name. References to the legend can also be spotted in many local place names.The project has been funded by a partnership between the Irish Writers’ Centre in Dublin and Mid-Ulster District Council.Martin Kearney, Chair of Mid-Ulster District Council attended the event. He said: “The story of Eochaidh and Liacute Ban shows just how rich and deep our local culture really is. Watching the children take it to their hearts today has been a lovely experience”Commenting on the project, Maacuteire Zepf said: “It was such a joy to unearth this gem of a local story with the children and to see their intense excitement about such an ancient tale. Hopefully, we can be assured now that Liacute Ban will live on now for the next generation.”Hilary Copeland, Acting Director of the Irish Writers’ Centre added:The Irish Writers Centre is delighted to support the Liacute Ban project. Our ‘writer-led’ programme offers writers the opportunity to develop their own creative projects, making use of their skills and experience with language and storytelling. We are grateful to Foras na Gaeilge for their continued support of Irish literature projects as Gaeilge.’ googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Council have supported calls to amend the Common Travel Agreementbetween Ireland and Britain.Lilian SeenoI-Barr said the passing of motions at both council meetings last week was most welcome and much appreciated by many migrants here as the Agreement as it currently operated discriminated, she claimed, against non-European people living on the island of Ireland. Speaking yesterday Mrs Seenoi Barr explained why the amendment was necessary: As someone who came from a non-EU country I experienced many of the restrictions the CTA imposed on me. For example, despite the fact I lived in Culmore I could not, quite literally, go half a mile down the road to Muff to buy a pint of milk. If I crossed the Border I was committing a crime. And this was despite the fact I was living in the North legally.She went on: The Common Travel Agreement was first agreed about a  years ago, in very dferent circumstances. I dont think it was envisaged back then that people from Africa or wherever would be living here. But thats how it is now. EU citizens can move freely between the North and the South, butyou are not an EU citizen you cant.I know of a nurse from South African living in Letterkenny who was detained for three days because she went to visit relatives in Scotland using Belfast airport. A Syrian boy in Belfast with a le-threatening heart condition needed emergency treatment that was only available in Dublin. Civil servants literally worked around the clock to sort out the red tape to ensure he could get that treatment. A young student in Derry couldnt go on a school trip to Dublin because she needed a visa. Every day we hear more and more about the impact of these kind of petty restrictions.Thanking everyone involved she said she wanted to acknowledge the support of all councillors from the ious parties who supported the motions calling for amendment to the CTA submitted by Councillor Martin Reilly in Derry and in Donegal by the chairman of Donegal Co. Council, Councillor Nicholas Crossan, who has also confirmed that Donegal Council has send a letter to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the issue.The North West Migrants Forum has been to the forefront in leading the campaign for the amendment and Director Seenoi Barr said she had had a number of meetings with councillors and other interested parties in recent weeks seeking their support to ensure that this was seen as a cross Border campaign. She has also been in constant touch with the British Council to get their backing.Mrs Seenoi Barr concluded: The CTA needs to be amended because it is no longer fit for purpose. Times have changed. If we are serious about inclusion and belonging then we must stand up for people across all sections of the community who are being discriminated against or being treated unfairly. Our objective is to ensure that all who live legally on the island of Ireland have the same rights as privileges as each other. I have spoken to many elected representatives, on both sides of the Border and in Britain, and as we have clearly seen in recent days there is real support for getting it changed. And we here at the North West Migrants Forum will be leading from the front in the campaign to ensure that it is. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

They were nursed back to health at Atnagelvin Hospitals Neonatal Intensive Care Unit where they spent the first few weeks of their lives.The girls are now aged four and are happy and healthy, but their mum and dad Bob and Michelle McLaughlin have never forgotten the nurses who cared for them when they were so vulnerable.The couple have since raised thousands of pounds for the NICU for supplies and equipment to help other babies who are born sick or too soon by holding an annual sponsored walk.But this year they wanted to give a special thank you to the NICU earth angel nurses and arranged a huge raffle and quiz night which raised pound, for the staff.The money was spent on  Foyleside vouchers and a pound MS voucher which were hand delivered by Saorlaith and Saoirse earlier this week.These nurses fought our battles in the NICU when we had no one  to turn to, like many other parents, explained Mr McLaughlin.They are the main reason we fundraise for the NICU at Altnagelvin and I think everyone agrees they deserve a thank you.They are our earth angels.The nurses in the Neonatal ward are highly trained and provide one to one care round the clock care for the babies.It is nice to let our nurses know that we appreciate them and everything they do for our children, continued Mr McLaughlin.We hope we put a smile on their faces.Earlier this week Saorlaith and Saoirse donned their Santa hats to pay a surprise visit to the ward where they were reunited with three of the nurses who had looked after them.One of the staff Oonagh hadnt seen the girls since they were born so I think she got a bit of a shock, said Mr McLaughlin.She recalled the sleepless nights she used to have worrying about the girls.Its lovely to know they remember them and shows how much they care and they were really pleased and grateful for the gts they received.Mr McLaughlin added: I would also like to thank all the local businesses who so generously donated to the raffle and the people who bought tickets and took part in our quiz night at the River Inn. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Crucially, Jamie McDonagh, wanted by a number of other clubs in recent weeks, has decided to stay at the club, signing for another year.This is the most important piece of business that weve done up until this point in terms of keeping the nucleus of last years group together, he explained. Everyone here played a huge part for us last year so it was a no-brainer to try and tie everybody down at the club for this coming season. There was a lot of success last year but we need to push it on and I think to achieve success here its going to be very important that the people who were here last year and here to push us on. This gives us that feel from last year but more importantly it gives us really good players and really good people at the club for . googletag.cmd.push  On Jamie McDonagh... Its a major boost. I think Jamie was outstanding for us last year. In my opinion hes one of the top wide players in the country. Jamie filled a lot of gaps last year for us but this year I predominantly see him as a forward player. When we look at Jamie, theres no-one in the country who has a better delivery of the ball and I think theres more to come form him. Some of our biggest rivals were looking to take Jamie. I think everybody in the league knows what he brings to the table. He was fantastic for us last year so were delighted to get it over the line and this could be a big, big year for Jamie. googletag.cmd.push  On Darren Cole... Hes a class act – i said it all last year that Darren Cole is as good a footballer as there is in the county. Everything is easy to Darren Cole, I never see him out of position, out of control. Everything he does is easy for him and thats the sign of a fantastic player. Darrens challenge now is to get back into the first team squad as quickly as possible and hes shown brilliant appetite in the off-season so far. Hes fortunate that theres a couple of other young players here pushing to get fit alongside him so hell have all the support thats required to get him back playing because when Darren Cole is playing theres nobody better in my opinion in the league.”  On Eoin Toal... Eoin Toal in my opinion went from being a young player with a lot of potential to a man who was undroppable. He played every game, made very few mistakes and really matured. Ive watched him in recent weeks playing for Northern Ireland at the highest level and hes wearing the captains armband there when theres so many high level players there from Scotland and England. Eoin has gone in and taken that captaincy and really stood out. You only have to look at his performances over the course of last year because as the season went on he was getting stronger and stronger. It will be interesting to seehe stays for the three years becausehe keeps going the way hes going theres a good chance that he wont see out the contract and one of the big guns from England or Scotland could snap him up.  On Nathan Gartside... I think Nathan and Peter Cherrie are going to fight it out to be number one this year. Last year we were flogging the same players and we fell over the line. We looked tired and fatigued and using the same  or  players – This year we need a squad of  players all on a similar level of ability. Nathans application over the past ten months has probably been the best at the club in the way he trains and conducts himself. His work in the off-season and his ability and his drive to do better is superb and to have the two boys here next year will be a huge asset to Derry City Football Club. Weve a goalkeeper of  whos been about the league and we have a goalkeeper at  who is going to be about for a very long time.  On Mark McChrystal... If I was a young player now and I was looking for a figure that could inspire me to have a good carer in the game then I couldnt look past Mark McChrystal. He probably has one of the best attitudes Ive ever worked with. Lets not forget that some of the best players in this league are in their thirties and Mark has a lot to offer, both on the pitch and off the pitch, and what a fantastic servant he has been. His experience is massive because he has played at the top level. Not just that but hes a brilliant person. He demands respect and hes fitter now than he has been in a long time and thats testament to the person he is.

An economist is also helping compile the document.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down is one of five local authorities paired with Belfast City Council, universities and theprivate sector who have

the councilrsquos Enterprise, Tourism and Regeneration Committee, politicians were told that officials have been working on the detailed outline business case since last May, with a consultancy team helping prepare the document.Council officials say that when work on the business case is completed next spring, it will provide a detailed analysis and assessment of the projectrsquos strategic fit within the City Deal.In addition, the document will also outline detailed project costs, the benefits, risks and funding requirements.Politicians were told this week that the documentrsquos analysis will recommend a particular procurement route in order to deliver the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the ongoing development of the business case involves planning considerations and the development of exemplar design and output specications, prior to any formal procurement exercise being undertaken.Politicians were informed on Monday night that the outline business case will provide detail on the technical expertise in terms of the design, construction and maintenance of similar international attractions and also provide detailed analysis of commercial operations of a visitor attraction of this scale.It is understood that council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the tourism investment and support to move the projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.Other aspects of the Mournes Gateway scheme include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision.There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes, with a so-called green travel network which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have

Someone came forward and this was welcomed by elderly people who would not be forced to travel outside the town to access services.Cllr Walker says it is vital that Ballynahinch retains its dedicated postal office and appealed to someone the townrsquos business community to consider taking over the service.ldquoBallynahinch is Down Districtrsquos third largest town and it would be a body blowthe planned temporary closure became permanent, he said.ldquoThe bottom lines appears to be thatno one comes forward to offer to run the service it will close and that will impact on people across the community.ldquoThe role of local post offices has changed considerably over recent years, with many transferring to large supermarkets which ensured that they were open for much longer, including weekends.ldquoMany elderly people prefer to conduct their business at post offices, not banks. That is one of the many reasons why this vitally important service is not lost to Ballynahinch. A number of local post offices, which provide a much broader range of services including banking facilities, are now housed in retail premises.Cllr Walker added: ldquoIt is my hope that one of the major retailers in Ballynahinch will come forward to ensure that the service is not lost to the town. While the post offices are important to our major towns, many are also at the heart of rural communities across the district.

And while there is a signicant financial benefit for securing geopark status, council officials insist the benefits are not just economic.They have previously argued that geoparks have a ldquosignicant role to play in empowering local communities and giving them the opportunities to develop cohesive partnerships with the common goal of promoting the arearsquos signicant geological and other heritage.There are currently  geoparks found in  countries across the world, all of which have been developed using a bottom-up approach with local communities playing a signicant role in this process.Currently, there are three designated geoparks in Ireland. In addition to the Marble Arch Caves in Fermanagh, they include The Burren and Clfs of Moher in Co Clare and the Copper Coast geopark in Co Waterford.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed on Monday afternoon that the local authorityrsquos bid for geopark was formally submitted last month..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Publication.jpg","title":"Book delves into the history around Strangford  ","story":"INVERBRENA Local History Group has launched the latest edition of its annual magazine mdash just in time for Christmas.Memories From Inverbrena: Strangford  features a selection of memories, stories, histories and photographs of people and places within the Strangford area, preserved for future generations.The magazine includes an article by Michael McConville in which he chronicles the history of the the local parish drama club during the s and s, including a selection of photographs of local amateur actors and actresses who participated in some of the popular well received productions.In his second article in this yearrsquos publication, Michael remembers happy days potato picking, recalling how everyone worked together as a team, both boys and girls, and all getting the same pay at the end of the day.Melanie Hamill puts pen to paper to provide an invaluable record of her splendid conversion of Strangford Presbyterian Church, earning it the prestigious  Heritage Angel award for Best Rescue of a Historic Building Or Place for projects under pound million.

These included the non-replacement of clerical staff who resign and y delays in the supply of equipment necessary for class use.Mr Ellis also slammed a proposal to impose a charge for school transport and labelled it as ldquoclearly unfair.He stressed that he was not taking the negative attitude that all cuts are bad.

He was very young and had been badly neglected. He had been kept in a confined space or a very small pen. Sony was very loving. All he wanted was to be loved and he thrived on attention.ldquoHe was a huge dog but very dirty. When we gave him a bath his coat came up lovely and white. We got him started with his first round of vaccinations and our followers stood by us financially.Monica works closely with Corran Kennels, on the Tobercorran Road outside Downpatrick, who come to her for helpthey need a puppy or dog re-homed, and Animal Connexions, based at Nutts Corner outside Belfast.Monica said: ldquoRecently a litter of  kittens were about to be euthanised and we managed to be able to find homes for all of them within a short period of time.Monica added that she has her own account with the two branches of Castle Vets in Downpatrick and Castlewellan and pays for any necessary medical attention abandoned pets may need out of her own pocket.ldquoMembers of the public are so good. When we put up an appeal on the page that an animal requires surgery or medicine they phone the vets and give money and it comes off the bill.ldquoI am so grateful to everyone. It can be tough going and running something like this takes a big chunk out of your le, but our team of volunteers are thankfully very enthusiastic.ldquoAnyone can follow the page. Just ask to join the group through the socialmedia network and followers will be able to keep up-to-date with what we are doing.Lana King, from Burrenreagh, is a volunteer with the not-for-profit organisation.She said: ldquoWhile the main aim of the page back in  originally was to reunite owners with their pets, there are times when nobody comes looking for a little lost one and thatrsquos when Monica goes beyond the call of duty and ensures they have a second chance with a new family.ldquoShe gets to know the potential owner, carries out a home check and follows it up. There is nothing she loves more than to hear how the pets she has helped to re-home or re-habilitate are doing.Lana added: ldquoMonica really is the back bone of Lost Found Pets South Down and has gained the admiration and respect from anyone who comes into contact with her.ldquoNothing is ever too much bother for her.ldquoShe has devoted her le to animals and makes sure every pet that comes to her receives the very best of care.ldquoEven though Monica suffers with a debilitating disease called lupus, she just gets up every morning and gets on with it.ldquoHer sharp wit, sense of humour and contagious laugh lts the spirits of people who are going through the heartbreak of having their pet go missing and reassures them because they know Monica will do everything she can to reunite them with their beloved pet.Lana added: ldquoMonica helps those pets who have found themselves either lost, abandoned, abused or simply not having a loving home to call their own..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Health.jpg","title":"Health workers take  industrial strike action  ","story":"HEALTH workers in Downpatrick took strike action last Friday ahead of a series of protests calling for pay parity and adequate nursing numbers.Nurses were working to rule yesterday and today at the Downshire and Downe Hospitals while a joint strike planned between their union, the Royal College of Nursing , and Unison, will be held next Wednesday.Hospital and outlying district services will be impacted as the strike will run from am until pm mdash unless a deal is done before that.Unison and the RCN are demanding equal pay for its members in line with UK counterparts and for increased nurse recruitment to protect patients in a failing health service.Domestics, porters, catering staff, administrative staff, dental nurses from all wards and departments in the Downe and Downshire Hospitals and outlying facilities will join nurses who have voted to strike for the first time in their -year history.Public support was high for health workers, including nurses from the Down Outpatients Department, who took part in Fridayrsquos strike.Hundreds of Unison members joined the picket in the morning and afternoon at Downshire Hospitalrsquos entrance with local drivers sounding support as they passed.The impact of the action closed the Outpatients department at the Downe Hospital, along with the Ulster Hospital, Lagan Valley, Ards and Bangor Hospitals.The Community Dental Service was impacted with the cancellation of the Ballynahinch clinic and two clinics at Downe Hospital on Friday afternoon.The impact was widespread for patients as day case surgery, ENT and gynaecology at Lagan Valley Hospital was cancelled along with the closure of the Medical Day Case Unit, Dermatology Laser Unit, Cath Lab and Ambulatory Hubs at the Ulster Hospital.The South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust said that that all affected patients had been contacted and would be rescheduled for appointments at a future date.Staff from the Downshire Hospital were strengthened by colleagues from the nearby Downe, who joined the picket.Unison members who work in the transport and domiciliary care went out on strike from am- noon while the rest of the workers came out from pm-pm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard and SDLP election candidate Michael Savage showed their support as did SDLP MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillors Oonagh Hanlon and John Trainor.Unison branch secretary Marian Ritchie called on all the elected representatives present to give members more than a show of support.She told cheering strikers: ldquoWe want every politician here now to give a commitment to say, as iniduals and as a group, that every single one of the the health service staff will get a pay rise and pay parity.The call was met with shouts of ldquoGet back to work by the strikers.Ms Ritchie also told her colleagues: ldquoThe Permanent Secretary says that he has the money but not the authority and the only ones that have the authority are the politicians.

McIlhone won the ball off a Ballynagross defender and without even looking up let one fly from  yards out.Goalkeeper Ross Preece was stranded in no manrsquos land and his despairing outstretched attempt to tip the ball over the crossbar failed as the ball nestled in the back of the net.Two minutes later, man of the match Ross Armstrong made it -. He chased a lost cause of a ball into the box where Marron and Preece were favourites to win the race, but Armstrongrsquos sheer desire helped to get him to the ball first and he was able to dink it into an empty net.With  minutes gone Armstrong pounced again to make it - after McIlhone had carved out the opening.Killough continued to bombard Ballynagross with everything and anything, but Ballynagross bravely weathered the storm and gradually started to create chances of their own.With  minutes gone they patiently worked an opening for Ryan McKinney, but he was denied a goal when the impressive Sean Og Burns got back to hack the ball off the line.That was as good as it got for Ballynagross as Killough made it - three minutes later. Gareth George picked the ball up from a Ben McLaughlin throw and immediately set off on one of his trademark, penetrating runs.George had only one thing on his mind after leaving three players for dead and his unerring finish into the bottom corner had Preece clutching at thin air.Six minutes later it was - when Armstrong headed a free back across the box and McIlhone had all the time in the world to send Killough into delirium.With  minutes gone a delightful cross from Adam George was met perfectly by Armstrong and the big striker powered an unstoppable header to the net to make it -.Some of Killoughrsquos play in the first half was breathtaking and few teams could have lived with them and as the players trooped off at half-time, everyone feared for Ballynagross.However, the break gave Campbell the chance to reorganise his troops and the were a dferent proposition in the second half.Marron pulled one back from the spot after Sean Og Burns took down Philip Doran in the box, but despite creating several other chances, that was it for Ballynagross.Eoin Rooney and Conor McCarron had shots well saved by Killough lsquokeeper Eddie Hinc, while Liam Graham headed over at the other end and Preece saved from Gareth George.Killough were a pale shadow of the side that lit up Binnian Park in the first  minutes, but they can be forgiven for taking their foot off the pedal after taking a - lead.Ballynagross can only reflect on what might have been, had they been able to field at full strength, but football can be a cruel game as they found out on Friday night.Killough: Eddie Hinc, Matthew Burns, Ben McLaughlin, Colm Stranney, Sean Og Burns, Matt McKiernan, Gareth George, Adam George, Tony McIlhone, Ross Armstrong, Riain Burns: Subs: Liam Graham, Seamas Tumelty, Ryan McIlhone, Robbie Hagan, Ruairi Sharvin.Ballynagross: Ross Preece, Deaglan Craig, Tom McNeill, Aaron Beattie, Conor Marron, Conor McCarron, Karl Johnston, Mark Magill, Daniel Taggart, Declan Dowie, Ryan McKinney.

Over the past year, the level of recycled waste has increased by %.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran hopes the work to provide mains power to the new Flying Horse Road facility is completed as soon as possible.ldquoI do not know why there is no mains power but it is a little embarrassing that the CCTV cameras at a poundm centre cannot be operated and we have had to hire in a private security firm, he said.ldquoThis represents an additional cost to already hard-pressed ratepayers and I hope that we are talking about days, not weeks, for the mains power to be supplied. It is an issue council officers need to be on top of.Cllr Curran said that many people were keen to see the new centre opened, given that its predecessor at nearby Cloonagh Road was struggling to cope with the huge demand being placed upon it.He continued: ldquoIt is great to have such a modern recycling facility on our doorstep to meet the needs of people who are clearly recycling their waste in increasing numbers. The new centre is being well used and the council deserves credit for this major investment but, in my opinion, the mains power issue should have been sorted before it opened for business.Cllr Curran said that given the increased emphasis on recycling, the council is behind innovative plans to allow groups and charities across the district to reuse ious items dumped at household recycling centres in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch.He added: ldquoA number of groups have expressed an interest in taking part and I have no doubt that this scheme will be a success with ious items destined for the scrapheap given a new lease of le.A council spokeswoman confirmed that the recycling centre was operating without mains power.ldquoIt has taken longer than anticipated to connect the mains power supply at the new site, said the spokeswoman.ldquoAs a temporary measure, a generator and security firm are being used to cover requirements. Newry, Mourne and Down Council is working to have the mains power installed as soon as possible.The Recorder asked the local authority how much it is paying the security firm to police the new civic amenity site outside its normal operating hours but was not provided with an answer..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Leitrim.jpg","title":"Sr Bartholomew’s centenary celebrations  ","story":"THE family of a Leitrim nun, who has lived in Africa for  years, flew thousands of miles to help her celebrate her  birthday.Sr Mary Bartholomew was joined by five nieces, including Dympna Kelly and Eileen Ramsey from her home village, who arrived in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, to mark her milestone birthday last week.Another niece, Mary McAleenan, from Slievnaboley, near Leitrim, who wasnrsquot able to make the journey, says her aunt had been on an adventure since she left home in  on board the Warwick Castle to care for ldquothe poorest of the poor amid the soaring heat of South Africa.Sr Bartholmew, was born Philomena Cunningham on December , , and enjoyed growing up with her four sisters and three brothers on what is now known as Kilnhill Road in Leitrim.She and her older sister, Mary Bernadette, who also became a nun, were among the first girls to play camogie in Leitrim before an official team had even been set up by the local Fontenoys GAA club.She was educated at Sacred Heart Grammar School in Newry and with her heart set on a religious vocation she entered the Assumption Convent in Ballynahinch just as World War II began.Her niece, Mary, said that being a nun in those days brought honour to a family and having two daughters as nuns set the Cunninghams apart within their small rural village.ldquoThere were nine other postulants accompanying Sr Bartholomew on the long voyage across to Africa. Her ship was the last passenger ship to sail to the continent for many years, as most ships were then commissioned for the war effort, Mary explained.The young nun swapped the green fields and rain of home for the blistering heat and bustle of Grahamstown in the Eastern Cape, which must have been quite an experience.She completed her religious formation and academic teacher training before taking her vows in . Over the following decades she taught in several schools. Eventually, on retiring, she was assigned a new mission, opening a clinic and a pre-school within an encampment that catered for over , refugees fleeing the horrors of the Mozambique war.In Sr Bartholomewrsquos own words of this period in her le, recorded in a book written over  years ago, Drumgooland ndash A Parish Divided, she recalls: ldquoWith missionary zeal we did our utmost over the following years to render whatever assistance we could to the many thousands of refugees, I taught including adults.ldquoThese poor people had a minimum of education and were eager to learn English. After class we would sit around and read the bible in Shangaan, the local language, and gave help when it was needed.Niece Mary takes up the story again. She added: ldquoNuns donrsquot retire and while Sr Bartholomew found the intense heat too much after several years, she made for the cooler environment of an office and spent time in general admin.Sr Bartholomew would often make the trip back home to Leitrim after Vatican II came to pass when the rigours and discipline of a pious le became more relaxed in the s. However, she was always looked forward to going back to Port Elizabeth.Her last trip home was some years ago when her older sister, Eileen, was seriously ill.ldquoShe had managed to hold her hand and chat briefly before she passed away, Mary recalled. She stayed until Eileenrsquos months mind,and left shortly after. This was the last time she was home..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th December 2019 Sophie.jpg","title":"Teenager Sophie fundraising for blind charity  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH teenager has embarked upon a fundraising initiative on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association.Sophie Millswill be selling raffle tickets for a host of prizes over the coming weeks ahead of a a key fundraising event in Ballynahinch Masonic Hall on February  next year.The Year  Ballynahinch High School student mdash who has been diagnosed with Albinism mdash is on the waiting list for a guide dog and has already been cane-trained by representatives from the charity.The teenager, who relies on the aid of her cane, is hoping that she will get her guide dog sometime next year, but is conscious that there is a long waiting list.Sophie, who recently finished in the top six of a SuperValu Superstars competition and was presented with a certicate during a glittering awards night at Belfastrsquos Titanic Hotel, is keen to help the Guide Dogs charity by raising money on its behalf.Her mum Marina said the estimated cost of training a guide dog is pound,.She explained: ldquoSophie wants to raise as much money as she can to help the charity which does not receive any government funding.

The meeting was devoted to Emma de Souza, who is campaigning to have British citizenship law amended so that people from Northern Ireland would no longer be automatic British citizens. Letter to the editorShe argues that the provision in the Belfast Agreement that says that people from Northern Ireland may ‘identy as’ Irish or British or both means that British citizenship ought to be relegated to a mere choice. This is despite the same clause of the agreement referring only to a right to hold ‘both British and Irish citizenship’. In October, this argument was dismissed in a withering judgment of the Upper Tribunal , which also declined permission to appeal, but Mrs De Souza has stated her intention to go to the Court of Appeal and is currently fundraising for her legal costs..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The Joint Committee, three of the nine attending members of which were from Sinn Fein , invited Mrs De Souza to give evidence along with Professor Colin Harvey, a nationalist academic, and a representative of the Committee on the Administration of Justice. All three repeated arguments conflating identity and citizenship and asserting a non-existent ‘right’ to choose citizenship. These are based on a nationalist interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and an apparent inability to appreciate that it is as much a unionist creation as a nationalist one. Nobody had been invited to put the case for the interpretation of the Upper Tribunal, or to give a unionist view or indeed any kind of an alternative view. There were no dissenting voices among the committee members. Nobody present even contemplated the possibility that the tribunal may have been correct. All apparently believe that, in , unionists and the UK government agreed that British citizenship should no longer be the default for those born in Northern Ireland and that despite such an agreement, the UK government chose not to include this in the legislation that gave effect to the agreement, and nobody in Parliamentnoticed.The meeting ended with O Caolain, the Sinn Fein chairman of the Joint Committee, asserting that British taxpayers’ money was being used to ‘crush Irish rights’, and accepting a proposal by Gerry Adams that it should write to the Irish government, urging it to give practicalsupport to De Souza’s appeal.As predicted, the De Souza campaign is moving firmly into the political arena. Nationalism is exerting signicant pressure and recent remarks at a Westminster Committee by the Secretary of State Julian Smith — when he appeared to contemplate amendments to UK citizenship law — indicate that it might be working. What are unionist representatives doing to defend the extant interpretation of the Belfast Agreement and UK citizenship law from this campaign J.

Alliances Stephen Farry, pictured with party leader Naomi Long, stunned the DUP by taking North DownIn past elections unionist parties – and most recently the DUP – have talked up the constitutional threat for their own advantage. No longer.Now the future of the United Kingdom is imperilled from myriad directions – and some of those are entirely beyond Northern Irish unionists’ control..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The decisive national outcome of the general election leaves the DUP with no leverage at Westminster. As a consequence, it now faces a rapid move towards an Irish Sea trade border.Having backed Brexit as something which would improve things, the DUP now finds that for which it dreamt and campaigned threatening to unravel the Union itself.Brexit itself and the DUP’s support not only for leaving the EU, but for a harder form of Brexit, was a key factor in the de facto nationalist and Green Party pacts in North Belfast and South Belfast which cost it two seats.The loss in North Belfast of Nigel Dodds, the party’s Westminster leader and one of unionism’s elder statesmen, is devastating.On Thursday night as it became clear that his seat was in jeopardy, one DUP member sent me a message saying: “We could lose anyone but him.”Few people across the DUP’s disparate and frequently warring factions would disagree with that sentiment.Not only is he a strategic asset to the DUP and a respected figure at Westminster in a way that some of his DUP colleagues are not, but his defeat speaks to a profound psychological problem for unionism.This seat, once held by the father of Ulster Unionism, Edward Carson, has never been held by a nationalist before – still less by a republican.As such, Mr Dodds’ defeat represents an old certainty which now is slipping away from unionism.Joint committee of Irish Parliament engages in nationalist groupthink over the de Souza citizenship case Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"And as the latest in a line of once impregnable unionist seats which have been lost by unionism, the result is evocative of a wider sense that not only control of Northern Ireland – but potentially Northern Ireland itself – is slipping away.There is no inevitability that a united Ireland is coming. Just four years ago, prior to Brexit and the collapse of Stormont, polls pointed to Northern Ireland being more constitutionally secure than at any point since its creation in .And even in this election, where unionism has suffered a grievous blow, Sinn Fein’s vote has fallen further than that of the DUP.The rise of the Alliance Party, astonishingly in this election the third largest party, is no guarantee of support for Irish unity.But it is a clear rejection of what has seemed like an archaic form of unionism whose biggest idea often seems to be to circle the wagons with an electoral pact when seats come under pressure.Yesterday the man who is seen by some DUP members as the great hope of unionism said something which appeared to misunderstand the core problem.Asked on Good Morning Ulster about the psychological damage of the result for unionism, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson referred to “the splintering of the unionist vote, for example, in places like North Down” and said that unionists wanted unity.It is a measure of how far unionism has fallen that a sentence like that can be uttered without drawing gasps.North Down is one of the safest unionist seats in Northern Ireland. Less than a decade ago, unionists won % of the votes there.If a unionist pact is required to stop it being lost, that is a pitul reflection on the state of the DUP and UUP.The logic of suggesting a pact in North Down is that there is almost no winnable seat which the UUP should contest without a pact.But while that would suit the DUP’s short-term interests – and perhaps even those of the UUPit gained a seat as a result – the evidence suggests that pacts are one of the reasons that Alliance is surging.Facing a developing fire, a move towards widespread unionist unity could act as an accelerant.Unlike nationalism, where Sinn Fein has – despite its major victory in North Belfast – had a poor election but has seen votes largely slip from it to the SDLP, this election has confirmed the complete dominance of the DUP within unionism.With that dominance comes responsibility when unionism falters.Will Arlene Foster accept that she is either accountable or responsible for any of this crisis  Or will she blame everyone but herself History suggests the latter, despite the fact that DUP members privately say that many voters expressed their unhappiness at Mrs Foster during canvassing.For a party renowned for its bare-toothed ruthlessness, the DUP has been remarkably understanding of the failures on Mrs Foster’s watch.There was an abortive putsch after she led unionism to the first loss of its Stormont majority in the history of Northern Ireland.Those who quietly muttered about challenging her then but chose not to do so must now wonderthey could have helped prevent this catastrophe for unionism.Unionism now lacks a strong leader at the point where it needs one most.Loyalists – including paramilitaries – poured into political activism their efforts at rejecting Boris Johnson’s Irish Sea border. Now that strategy has failed, where do they go Some, based on the recent meeting in Portadown from which my colleague Ben Lowry reported, will be arguing for street protests,not outright violence.Even setting aside moral considerations, past loyalist violence has been strategically disastrous and the street disorder during the flag protests actually boosted Alliance’s vote.Unionism stands weary at another crossroads. But unlike the choice between Terence O’Neill’s moderation and the full-throated unionism of Paisleyism  years ago, this time the possibility of a vote for Irish unity is more real than many then could conceive.And this time there is a sense of unionism lacking a single leader with the ability and ideological purpose to even lead unionist opinion – let alone those now deserting unionism.try catch  TrendingNI snow now due to arrive earlier than originally thought -

was a vote of opposition to the Prime Ministers proposed deal over concerns it would create a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Mr Shannon delivered his maiden speech to the House of Commons in the Ulster Scots tongue when first elected in .On Friday, he said: \"The union has been degraded and downgraded by Boris Johnson.\"He would take your alsatian dog for a walk, he would come back an hour later and give you a chihuahua and tell you it was all right.\"He said they needed to convince the British premier of the importance of the union, and claimed the DUPs numbers in the next Parliament would give it influence.Mr Shannon added: \"We will do our bit to make sure that the union, for those who live in Leicester, London, Manchester, Newcastle or wherever  in the UK, also is the same for the people of Strangford and the people of Strangford have told me that.\"His closest rival, the cross-community Alliance partys Kellie Armstrong, said Northern Ireland deserved a restored devolved government.She said: \"We have a health service that is falling apart, we have education that needs reform, we have infrastructure that is in a desperate state of crisis and it is time for the Assembly to be back.\"She added: \"We have had enough, you have had enough and it is time to move on.\"- West TyroneIn an unsurprising victory, Orfhlaith Begley raced across the line to claim the West Tyrone seat.In an election that saw , votes polled, Ms Begley won the seat with , votes.It was expected that the Carrickmore woman would hold to the seat, which has been in Sinn Feins hands since  after Pat Doherty was elected.The -year-old is the first woman to hold the West Tyrone seat.She was selected by Sinn Fein to contest the by-election in  after Barry McElduff stepped down from the seat following a controversy over a video he posted to Twitter.The turnout for West Tyrone was .%, slightly more than the by-election which saw .% of the electorate cast its vote.Speaking after her win, Ms Begley said: \"This was a crucial election, the election of a generation and clearly people wanted their views heard in terms of Brexit.\"This is a border constituency that rejected Brexit in the referendum and people came out again in this election to once again reject Brexit.\"People have been very energised in terms of of this campaign and people came out in their thousands to reject Brexit but also to reject Tory austerity.\"They sent a very clear message that they see their future in a new Ireland for all.\"Sinn Fein has made its voice count where it matters, in terms of Brussels, we have been there, in Dublin and we also travel to London on a regular basis.\"We gave a pledge in  that we would ensure special status for the North, we would protect the Good Friday Agreement and the all Ireland economy and we have delivered on all three of those.\"-North BelfastSinn Feins John Finucane has declared North Belfast has rejected Brexit after winning the seat from incumbent, the Democratic Unionist Party deputy leader Nigel Dodds.Mr Finucane triumphed following a tight contest with Mr Dodds taking the seat with , votes ahead of his rival who finished on , votes.The Sinn Fein man, who benefited from a pro-Remain alliance with the SDLP and Green Party who stood aside in support of him, said his victory was a rejection of Brexit.\"I want to thank each and every person who came out to vote for me today and I also want to acknowledge here tonight that there were those who stretched themselves and I know that this election was an election that transcended party politics and I know that I was very much the beneficiary of that today,\" he said.\"I think this election is about the future of North Belfast, we saw the threat of Brexit and what that meant for the people of Belfast, we saw the threat to our economy, the threat to our childrens futures and I think that message, that remain voice that was heard in  was amplied beyond recognition again tonight.\"North Belfast rejects Brexit, North Belfast is a Remain constituency, North Belfast wants a future as part of the European Union and I think that is hugely signicant.\"He added: \"As an MP I pledge to you all tonight that I will work for every single person in this constituency whether you voted for me or not.\"Referring to Sinn Feins policy of not taking seats at Westminster, Mr Dodds said he \"regrets North Belfast will be left unrepresented in the House of Commons at a challenging time\".The DUP man who had held the seat since  said: \"As far as Brexit is concerned, it is very clear now that Brexit is going to happen with Boris Johnsons predicted majority and it is very very important that the Northern Ireland Assembly is got up and running as quickly as possible so that the Northern Ireland Executive and politicians can have a role in that going forward. But Boris Johnson needs to understand that we must have a Brexit that ensures that it protects the integrity of the United Kingdom and is the best deal for Northern Ireland and that is something we will continue to work with the Government on in the days ahead.\"- Mid UlsterSinn Feins Francie Molloy has comfortably retained his seat in Mid Ulster with .% of the vote.It is a seat the party has held for  years, with former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness the MP from  until  when he was replaced by Mr Molloy in a by-election.With , votes polled, Mr Molloys share is down slightly since the  election when he won .% of the vote.He said: \"This was a Brexit election.

unsurprising victories of the night, the DUPs Gregory Campbell has retained his seat in East Londonderry.With a lions share of the vote at ,, Mr Campbell was ed comfortably.\"When those who try to analyse and say votes are down, I hope they will look at the vote we got in East Londonderry and see that our majority is up,\" he said.\"Thats because the people here want a hardworking, effective hard hitting MP who doesnt pull any punches and thats what they will get in the next few years.\"We will wait to see the outcome, and hopefully all parties commit to get back to Stormont to make this country the best country in the United Kingdom and make it a much more prosperous country weve had in the past.\"Speaking before his win, Mr Campbell said the onus was on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to deliver on his brexit promises, adding: \"Well, whatever majority Boris has there will be an onus on him to deliver on no checks east-west and an even bigger issue on how does he preside over the UK, Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and how does he cement that and build that for the future.\"In my view, he has to do that on an economic basis, so that people here and in Scotland see a tangible benefit of staying in the UK, and then people will want to stay.\"The incumbent Mr Campbell romped home against newcomer SDLP candidate Cara Hunter on ,, who pipped Sinn Fein to the post for second place by just  votes.Also running against Mr Campbell was Richard Holmes, UUP, Sinn Feins Dermot Nicholl, the Alliance Partys Chris McCaw, and from newly-formed Aontu party Sean

tonight after garnering , votes, against Ms McCallions ,.Ms McCallion was previously elected in  from Mr Eastwoods colleague Mark Durkan by the tightest of margins with only  votes, in what is historically an SDLP heartland and the home of former leader John Hume.It was clear from early in the evening that the SDLP were due to make something of a comeback in Northern Irish politics, as Mr Eastwood and his colleague Claire Hanna were both predicted for victories.It was made even clearer when upon her arrival to the Magherafelt count centre, Ms McCallion congratulated her rival before the votes had even been called out.\"Keep it up,\" she said as hugged Mr Eastwood.Mr Eastwood said that he was keen for Northern Ireland to \"get back to work\".\"I want to especially thank the people of Derry, I think they have sent a clear message, roared that message to all of us in politics today,\" Mr Eastwood said during his victory speech.\"This is a story about the revival of the SDLP but its more about the message and desire of the people of our city and the people of the north generally.\"We hear you loud and clear, we know you want someone to go to Westminster to fight your case, to stand up to Boris Johnson, to protect us from Brexit.\"You also want us to get back to work in Stormont, no more excuses will be accepted by the people of our city or by the people of Northern Ireland.\"Monday is an opportunity, lets get on with it.\"The total votes polled for the Foyle constituency was ,, which marked a .% turnout.In third was the DUPs Gary Middleton on ,.Candidates who

in London, in Europe, in America and indeed on this island.\"Mr Maskey added: \"We will continue to make sure that our voice is heard.\"We have a mandate to deliver equality and respect and we have a

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That can only mean one thing – the dreaded hangover.We’ve all been there, right  That last round of tequila shots sounded like a mighty fine idea, but now it’s the morning after the night before and you are paying for it – with interest.Your head is pounding, your stomach is queasy, and it feels like something small and furry crawled into your mouth overnight and died there.Granted, the damage has well and truly been done – but what can you do about it now  How do you cure that hangover  Heck, can you even cure a hangover Well, that depends on who you ask. There’s a host of weird and wonderful hangover cure claims floating around, but the old saying ‘horses for courses’ applies here. That is to say, what works for one person may not do a thing for another.At the risk of stating the obvious, the best way to avoid a hangover is to drink less alcohol. Or none at all.It’s also a very good idea to eat a decent meal before heading out, and alternating between an alcoholic beverage and a hydrating glass of water can lessen the effects of a hangover.Assuming, though, that all that sage advice went out of the window last night, here’s six hangover cures to try.A hearty bowl of soupOkay, so this is only a good ideayou can still stand straight, but Austrians swear by this method.When you’ve had a skinful of booze, grab a big bowl of goulash soup before heading to bed.It will prevent the alcohol soaking further into your bloodstream, and is always a better idea than that kebab you were craving at am.Eat a protein breakfastDr Andrew Irvine, who published How To Cure A Hangover, suggests a simple breakfast.“Protein, in the form of eggs, will help your hypoglycaemia , as will porridge,” he says. “The headache should ease once the blood sugar level has been corrected, then take some soluble paracetamol.”BeroccaThe Aussies, it’s fair to say, seem know a thing or two about drinking.After one too many tinnies, simply drop a tablet of this over-the-counter, nutrient-packed tablet in a glass of water.Works bestyou do the same before drinking. It may not completely cure your hangover, but it’s a refreshing pick-me-up that’s packed with vitamins.ParacetamolDissolve a soluble paracetamol tablet in a glass of water and not only will it go a long way towards curing that throbbing headache, but it will provide rehydration, which is all important. Unlike Ibuprofen it won’t irritate the stomach.Be warned, though: too much paracetamol is toxic to the liver – and it has probably taken enough of a pounding as it is. and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share by email\" data-param-subject\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Facebook\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\" and cure your hangover\" data-s-urlclick\" news -ways-try-and-cure-your-hangover-\" data-s-el\"in article - bottom\" aria-label\"Share to Twitter\" data-param-text\" ways toand cure your hangover\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-fixed i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" style\"width:pxheight:px\" i-amphtml-layout\"fixed\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-hrWEMg jOIOLG\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-eXEjpC crVkTS\"Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful linksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bMVAic sc-bAeIUo dEhRfb\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "},{"url":null,"title":"these are foods you shouldnt feed your dog christmas ","story":"Suspicious vehicle alertYou could be owed a Cold Weather Payment thanks to the dip in temperatures - how to checkyou’re eligibleNewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherEducationBusinessPoliticsHealthPeopleRead ThisSportFootballOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleCarsHomes and GardensNewsPeopleThe ethanol in alcohol can hit an animals bloodstream faster than humans.

The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
