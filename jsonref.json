Pharaonic in its scale and ambition, the under-construction metropolis is the vision of the country’s former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, born in part from the desire to ersify the Qatari economy and distance it from oil dependence.Financed by the government via the Qatari Diar real estate company, the city was initially conceived in 2005 but development truly took off when Qatar was announced as the host of the 2022 World Cup.It is also a showpiece in the government’s Vision 2030 sustainable development plan, with a range of features from water-sensitive landscaping plans to a district cooling system designed to save 65m tons of CO2 a year.Although an independent urban centre, Lusail is also an extension of Qatar’s capital, Doha. The two cities are 15km apart and will be connected by subways and state-of-the-art train lines. Developers are hoping people will attracted by the city’s marina, one of the biggest in the Gulf, as well as its shopping malls, business districts, golf courses, artificial islands and amusement park. Scores of new cities are rising across the world from previously untouched desert and jungle, or on land “reclaimed” from the sea. While the history of cities built from scratch is long, the scale of the current epidemic is beyond anything seen before.\u0026nbspAnother 2.5 billion people are predicted to move to cities over the next 30 years and the trend shows no signs of stopping.

We remember past visions of future cities and ask, is there ever a good reason to start a city from scratch?Qataris remain in the minority: of the country’s 2.6 million inhabitants, they number approximately 313,000. The exponential population growth is largely due to workers from developing countries such as Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh, working mainly as manual labour for the country’s building projects, including the infrastructure needed for the World Cup.But given the well-documented poor working conditions and effective segregation of these workers from the Qatari population, it seems evident that the manicured environs of Lusail are not aimed at them. Instead, the city seems designed to tempt more highly skilled workers from developed nations as part of the country’s preparation for the post-oil era.I meet two of Lusail’s first residents: Chaiun Chung, a communications specialist from South Korea, and his friend and neighbour Sophie Nowland, an Australian who moved to Qatar to teach. Chung was drawn to the city because of its newness, its cheapness in comparison with Doha and the surprising new architecture springing up every day – the houses in Chung and Nowland’s neighbourhood, for example, are inspired by Italian architecture. Lusail’s planned transport connections to Doha and lack of traffic are also attractive, and not just to Chung. “Two years ago, there was nobody here,” he says. “In the last year, there are more and more people.”The Qatari government hopes Lusail will position the country as a model for the Middle East in terms of sustainability, human development, economy, tourism and sport. When the city’s 80,000-seat stadium hosts the opening match and final of the 2022 football World Cup, the eyes of the world will be upon it.For now, however, only a small part of the city has been built. Just a few offices and one coffee shop are open, but already people are coming from Doha to wander around the marina at night when the weather is cooler. More will doubtless make their way to explore the new city in a few months when the metro is up and running.As the city grows, landscaping turns more and more desert sand green, and yet more land is reclaimed from the sea to be built upon. As I watch this city of the future being constructed before my eyes, I have the very strong sense that anything is possible.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f512326c666bc1c9e55cc1fc203a309f3f0f5877/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6475ffe99c7390d518250973054ecbda","title":"faith religion politics british attitudes survey","story":"In these dark times the Enlightenment itself can seem in retreat. Fact-free emotion wins over reason and the hard-earned liberalism of centuries is thrown into reverse. Donald Trump and Boris Johnson succeed by flamboyantly disregarding truth. Gwyneth Paltrow disseminates Goopy nonsense, Jeremy Hunt dabbles with homeopathy, and mystical claptrap from crystals to hopi ear candles encroach on the domain of evidence-based medicine. The frightening rise of anti-vaxxers puts at risk the gigantic progress in disease control. Are we heading back to the dark ages?No, is the answer. Breathe a sigh of relief. These strange irrational phenomena are only marginalia in the onward march of reason. The annual British Social Attitudes survey is the best mirror we have to show us an image of who we are, what we think and how we change over the decades since it began asking the same questions in 1983.For a third of state schools to be run by the religions is an affront: their subtle social selection is the draw that brings young parents (briefly) to their knees in the pews to get their children into church schools. The segregation of children by faith is getting worse – a dangerous trend in a world of populist politicians stirring up race hate. This country’s firmly secular values need to be upheld against the religious resistance to sex and relationship lessons in over-segregated schools. The right to religious freedom doesn’t supersede national education values.This visceral Brexit war between old and young, between regions and outlook, has often felt like a conflict between reason and unreason, between economic fact and emotional national identity. But the BSA report reassuringly finds that beneath the surface of our present turmoil, superstition and unreason are on the retreat, with the onward march of trust in evidence-based scientific truths. When it comes to the great climate question and whether life on Earth will survive, that augurs well. Not prayers but only human agency can save us."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09cb606e165a5195241080e8cb90046ed8e029b2/0_221_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b522b5089c54613904bc4fdb8e6c9811","title":"progressive united ireland dup","story":"It’s an odd time for the DUP. Having spent the past two years backing the government on a Brexit that a majority of Northern Irish citizens voted against, it now finds support for Irish reunification at its highest ever level in Northern Ireland, the Irish Republic and, crucially, among their supposed ideological fellow-travellers in the Conservative party. More pressingly still, MPs this week voted to extend crucial human rights to Northern Ireland, direct from Westminster, paving the way for the decriminalisation of abortion and the implementation of marriage equality, in line with the rest of the UK.How did a party as frothingly opposed to liberal social change as it is to Irish reunification end up presiding over a reality in which both are more likely than they have been in decades?Explaining any aspect of Northern Irish politics in depth is a bit like giving a friend an update on all those operations that your dog has just had – it’s obviously sad, complicated, and painful, but without ever actually being interesting, which means that the second you begin speaking, your pal is only half-listening, and merely waiting for a polite moment to change the subject.Having gained their position through inflexibility rather than political savvy, it’s not surprising that deadlock is so common. This is best evidenced by the current 913-day suspension of Stormont, following fallout from the renewable heat incentive scandal, in which the DUP was implicated in a morass of financial mismanagement somewhere between sheer incompetence and rank corruption: Sinn Féin accused the DUP of not being held accountable for the scandal, and refused to come back to the table until this occurred. Then the music stopped and Northern Irish voters were left like embarrassed partygoers, sipping lukewarm drinks and calling cabs while our married hosts accost each other with insults that have clearly been brewing for a while.It is for this reason that Sinn Féin is sanguine about accepting “direct rule” in this instance, because in the absence of a devolved parliament, people still need human rights, and both abortion rights and marriage equality are among its stated positions. It is also why the DUP is opposed to having full equal treatment under British law, because while it loves being British, for it that means things like bowler hats and mushy peas, not reproductive rights and especially not anything that gets in the way of its hateful views about gay people.And look, it’s easy to call the DUP homophobic – because it’s entirely true in every conceivable way. Founder Ian Paisley spent the 1970s attempting to “save Ulster from sodomy” and the language hasn’t been moderated much since. Ian Paisley Jr has said he is “repulsed by gay and lesbianism”. In 2008, then party leader Peter Robinson called homosexuality “an abomination”, after his wife, Iris Robinson MP, announced in the Commons that “there can be no viler act, apart from homosexuality and sodomy, than sexually abusing innocent children”. Last year Arlene Foster was praised for becoming the first DUP leader to attend an event for LGBT people but, once there, she insisted that the DUP’s campaign to deny them equal rights be “respected, if not agreed with”.And this is a point that should be emphasised, amid well-meaning commentary referring to these issues as controversial – in actual fact, few issues in Northern Ireland are less isive.It remains to be seen if Foster and her pals will end up living in a pro-choice, gay-friendly united Ireland – a Sodom and Begorrah, lifted directly from their most fervid nightmares, one that they would have accidentally helped create. Like Homer Simpson, his arm trapped in a vending machine by his refusal to let go of the snack he was attempting to pilfer, the DUP is losing the fight to block its citizens’ rights simply because it’s too stubborn to resume the very parliament it controls.It is this intransigence that has been cannily exploited by the thousands of people all over Northern Ireland who have spent decades campaigning for all of us to get the rights we deserve. It is their efforts, and their victory, we should celebrate. There’s often very little to cheer about the sickly animal that is Northern Irish politics, but this week shows there could be life in the old dog yet.• Séamas O’Reilly is a writer from Derry.

In the same week, but with only a fraction of the same ballyhoo, the Liberal Democrats will also choose a new leader. The Lib Dems’ choice is very unlikely to be prime minister. Nevertheless, the party’s new leader could be a more pivotal player in the emerging politics of the 2020s.The Lib Dems have spent most of this decade paying the electoral price for the coalition of 2010-15. In the 2015 election, the 50-year march towards the political gunfire that began under Jo Grimond was devastated. The party plummeted from 57 MPs to a mere eight. Under Tim Farron and Vince Cable, the party was no longer preparing for government as it did under leaders from David Steel to Nick Clegg, but for possible extinction.Most of this is down to Brexit. But a lot is also down to Mr Cable. The veteran former trade secretary has been a calm captain in stormy seas. He has kept the party together, overhauled its operations and been clear about the dangers of Brexit. He has seen off the potential challenge from Change UK. He has continued to work the still productive political soil of the middle ground. His reward is the current revival. But now is the right time for new leadership.Politically, little ides the two candidates for the succession. Ed Davey and Jo Swinson both served in government. Both fought their corners in the coalition. Each has had to win back a parliamentary seat they lost in 2015. Each is far more seriously committed to Europe and to prioritising the climate emergency than many in Labour and the Tories. Neither has the charisma of Paddy Ashdown or Shirley Williams. Mr Davey is sometimes a tad more tribal, while Ms Swinson is perhaps more of a pluralist.Each would thus be a plausible leader for new times. But that is where this contest has disappointed more generally. It has been polite, which is good, but it has not been visionary. The liberal centre in Britain and elsewhere – this problem is far from confined to the Lib Dems or to the UK – has not yet produced the strategic response to post-crash populisms of left and right that it should. Nor has it shown the confidence to set out a serious strategy for healing deep Brexit ides. The Lib Dem revival owes much more to Brexit than to a revived confidence in liberal democracy. The task of the next leader will be to ensure that the party confronts both of these challenges. There is more even than Brexit at stake."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3eea56d3df011efdc6be5485b2252c7e2a09d536/0_1693_3566_2139/master/3566.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=178d0f495d366960d9e7cdde506c907a","title":"government calls on ofs to clamp down on university grade inflation","story":"The surge in first-class degrees is not confined to a handful of rogue universities. Ninety-four percent of the 148 higher education providers included in the OfS analysis demonstrated a “statistically significant” but unexplained increase in the proportion of first-class degrees awarded last summer compared with 2010–11.Damian Hinds, the education secretary, described the figures as “disappointing” and warned that they risked undermining public trust in standards at English universities. “It cannot be right that some students are awarded higher grades for the same level of achievement than those from previous years.“We owe it to the hardworking students and institutions who play by the rules to stamp out this unfair practice. I expect the OfS to challenge those providers where the data suggests there are unjustified and unexplained increases in attainment, and demand evidence of the actions they are taking to stop this.”The OfS conducted a similar exercise last December and at that time issued a stark warning to universities that they could be fined or even removed from the official register if they failed to tackle spiralling grade inflation.In the past, the sector has countered accusations of grade inflation, arguing that higher education has changed in recent years, with universities putting more emphasis on the quality of teaching, and students paying high tuition fees working harder in order to get the best outcome from their investment.According to the OfS, however, even taking into account factors like entrance qualifications and student characteristics, which may influence attainment, there is still an “unexplained” difference of 13.9 percentage points compared with OfS predictions for the share of firsts in 2017–18.The regulator acknowledged that there were positive signs that the higher education sector had begun to tackle the issue, and said it would take time for change to take effect.Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the Office for Students, warned however: “Worries about grade inflation threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students. So it is essential we regain and maintain public confidence in the reliability of degree classification.”The OfS is now planning to contact universities with the highest unexplained increases in degree classifications. “We will ask them to provide further information to help us understand how they account for these increases.” said Lapworth. “In seeking this additional information, we recognise that there are factors that could explain the increases – for example, improvements in learning and teaching – that we have not been able to measure in our analysis.”Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, the umbrella organisation that represents universities, said the sector was committed to protecting its world-leading reputation. “Students deserve to have qualifications which they can take pride in, and employers and the wider public need to have confidence in the results students achieve.“This commitment was shown by the overwhelming support for the recent sector-wide statement of intent which maps out a framework for action, and we know that institutions are already taking action to review their processes and data.“It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement, and such improvements are to be celebrated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c960ac6157fda9ec03e3c3fa54df1450641f72ba/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1fa01575e409786f60d2c1ae36941892","title":"meat infected by african swine fever found in uk for first time","story":"Highly contagious virus can live for months in processed meat and would have ‘devastating implications’ if passed to live pigsAfrican swine fever has been picked up in meat seized by port authorities in Northern Ireland, the first time the ASF virus has been detected in the UK.Officials confiscated more than 300kg of illegal meat and dairy products from airport passengers’ luggage in June. Samples tested by the Agri-Food and Biosciences Institute in Belfast confirmed traces of the virus, which is highly contagious and can survive for several months in processed meat.According to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, the detection of “DNA fragments” of the virus does not pose a significant health threat to Northern Ireland’s animal health, nor does it change the country’s “disease-free status”.But Zoe Davies of the National Pig Association said the discovery highlighted just how vulnerable the UK pig herd is to ASF infection.“We have always maintained that the biggest threat to the UK pig herd is from infected meat products that are illegally brought in from infected regions that then find their way into the UK pig herd or feral boar population,” said Davies.“There’s a possibility that it’s here already, perhaps in somebody’s fridge, because our checks on most of our borders right now are not very good. The risk is high – and it’s a big concern for us as an industry.”The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently announced that it would ramp up ASF controls at ports and airports, and launch a new poster campaign targeting travellers from ASF-affected regions, with warnings about bringing meat products into the country.ASF is harmless to humans, although scientists have warned that physiological similarities between pigs and humans mean future mutations of the virus could become dangerous.Nearly 6,000 ASF outbreaks are ongoing worldwide, according to the World Organisation for Animal Health. ASF can be transmitted through direct contact with infected animals and can also spread via insects such as ticks. The virus can live for several years in frozen carcasses, so meat products are a particular concern for cross-border transmission.“If infected meat got past the authorities and into the pig herd in Northern Ireland, or anywhere else in the UK, it would have devastating implications,” said Alistair Driver, editor of Pig World.“That is why there is such a big drive at the moment to step up controls and awareness of the risks at ports and airports, and to highlight to all pig keepers the dangers of feeding meat and any waste food to pigs, which is illegal under the swill-feeding ban.”The disease has wreaked havoc since it broke out in China, which is home to the world’s largest pig herd. A third of the country’s pigs have been culled.Its slow spread across Europe has also led to panic and anxiety. The disease was detected in Belgium last year, and the Danish government is now building a wall to prevent the disease entering their country via wild boar: the pig industry is a key component of their economy. Meanwhile, a new report by the Food and Agriculture Organization says that ASF poses a “serious threat to food security”.The National Pig Association has launched an industry-wide #MuckFreeTruck campaign to remind everyone across the supply chain and hauliers about the importance of ensuring trucks are clean and not carrying disease.“We are also encouraging producers to put up clear signage on footpaths and other areas of public access close to pig units warning the public not to feed pigs,” said Davies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2390a8bc55bddc27f1318e27f82835cce94cd44a/0_19_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b464e756b53de7cecb2774b560dab2ae","title":"iran filmfarsi remains biggest secret in cinema history","story":"For many Iranians, the oft-forgotten films are a souvenir of a lost past, painting a picture of life before the 1979 revolutionShortly after the 1979 Iranian revolution, the country’s national newspapers published a joint subpoena, unique in film history. All the key stars of “filmfarsi” – a form of popular cinema that embodied the aspirations and illusions of a modernising society – were summoned to the revolutionary court. The careers of hundreds of actors and directors ended overnight. Unlike the Hollywood blacklisting of the McCarthy era, there was not even the opportunity for a mock hearing. The cinema, seen as emblematic of corruption, “westoxification” and the decadence of the ousted Pahlavi regime, was consigned to oblivion.So marked the end of one of the most thriving film industries in the Middle East, a cinema of song and dance, sex and seduction, violence and vengeance, which combined the western genres with local flavour – although always with an eye on Shia Islam, as the ultimate code to put everything in its right order. Iranian cinema was anything but limited to poetry and humanism, although both elements existed in some of the pre-revolutionary arthouse films. Millions of filmgoers cared more about a good pop song, the latest tearjerker and a car chase through the streets of Tehran.Cinema was introduced to the country as the exclusive toy of the Qajar kings. Sporadic efforts to create a national cinema were interrupted by the allied occupation of neutral Iran during the second world war. After the war, the new shah, the Swiss-educated Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, was so busy making Iran a modern “island of stability” (to quote Jimmy Carter) that cinema was abandoned in favour of social and military infrastructure.What happened, however, was that people on the ground took control of the camera, telling their own tales. They even created their own national genres such as “jaheli” films, stories of tough guys in hats from south Tehran, pulling knives in the name of honour and hooking up with local cabaret singers, eventually saving them from a life of disgrace.The term “filmfarsi” was coined to ridicule the sloppiness of these films. Today, they can be more properly judged in the broader context of Iranian mainstream cinema: genre films with popular stars village girls lured by the big city but eventually returning to the tranquillity of home – as if everybody knew from the start that the modernisation project wouldn’t last. A miniature of Iranian society, foreshadowing things to come.Not surprisingly, women were stereotyped: mothers or whores with little middle ground. Yet filmfarsi also offered them a chance to be seen. It even offered women agency and power. If the forced unveiling of women under the first Pahlavi was a crucial point in the history of Iranian women, the real unveiling, although highly fetishised, was through these movies, in which women travelled, taught, fought and settled their scores.Something rare, euphoric and mad was recorded on celluloid: the Iranian way of life after the second world war, with all its paradoxes. Even the sleaziest films became documents. If the majority of key Iranian arthouse films of the 1960s and 1970s were set in villages and rural areas (a tradition continued until after the revolution), filmfarsi was about the thriving cities, which were expanding blindly, thanks to petrodollars.Boy-meets-girl stories found an edge, as the Iranian way of life encountered a new world through American, Italian, French and Bollywood films. When Iranians loved a foreign film, they sometimes remade it. There is an Iranian version of Hitchcock’s Vertigo, as well as a feminist version of Billy Wilder’s Sabrina, in which two sisters compete for the affection of the family chauffeur. The result was often camp and only the barest traces of the original storyline remained. However, a confused and frustrating search for an identity through this bizarre process is detectable. Across roughly 1,000 films, they forged it in a remarkable way.For many Iranians today, filmfarsi is the souvenir of a lost past. For me, after spending the past four years making a film about filmfarsi, I view the films as documents of how Iranian society changed its schizophrenic nature in grabbing on to anything “modern” with one hand and rejecting it with the other.It is also the story of a tragedy, both cinematic and real. One of the turning points of the Iranian revolution, and the key moment when the bells tolled the death of cinema, was when the Islamists set fire to the Rex in south-west Iran, where people were watching the second run of The Deer – an immensely popular 1974 drama about two former classmates rebelling against the system, which tested the censors. Directed by Masoud Kimiai and starring some of popular cinema’s best-loved figures, it transformed filmfarsi into something profound and politically committed. Four hundred people burned to death in that cinema. The pain is still there. But out of its ashes arose a new Iranian cinema.Forty years after the Iranian revolution, filmfarsi, with all its joyful vibrancy and popular eclecticism, remains one of the biggest secrets of film history.• Ehsan Khoshbakht’s Filmfarsi will world premiere at Cinema Rediscovered at Bristol Watershed on 26 July"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0592ccb99a7c7998eddf64a3c9d158f48f2a0851/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a371667b78c20cfa7df771b3eee15b14","title":"the brink review steve bannon documentary far right","story":"Alison Klayman’s intriguing documentary tracks the slippery strategist following his departure from the Trump White HouseAudiences should be wary of documentaries featuring charmingly roguish, twinkly-eyed reactionary villains who play liberal film-makers for suckers. This is what happened during Errol Morris’s feeble film about Donald Rumsfeld. And Morris’s own study of media executive and White House strategist Steve Bannon, American Dharma, was considered a failure because slippery-yet-cordial Bannon wouldn’t take the bait.Bannon, himself a dabbler in film-making who managed the US video release of Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 911, knows the score. But Alison Klayman’s film does better than most, as she follows Bannon in the luxury wilderness period that followed his sacking by Donald Trump – pursuing a grisly consciousness-raising world tour of far-right media organisations, breaking bread with blandly self-pitying lite-fascists all over Europe and travelling on a handsome private jet. Who’s paying for that, you may ask? Bannon isn’t saying. And what is he on the brink of? Power? Defeat? It’s an ambiguity that is important to the American far right, so they can be excitingly on the verge of victory while nursing their trembly-lipped underdogvictim status.Bannon himself is on a permanent euphoric high from his celeb status, and uncritical media treatment, particularly among saucer-eyed Euro right-wingers. But as last year’s US midterm election results come in, his cheery manner slips and he starts shouting at people. A Brit underling fails him, and Bannon appoints his gruesome nephew Sean Bannon (Scrappy to his Scooby) as this man’s replacement in the organisation he toe-curlingly calls The Movement.What emerges from Klayman’s film is how very important Brexit Britain is as a self-vivisecting research animal in Bannon’s experimental thinking. He uses irony and satire to disarm his leftie tormentors (“What would Leni do? How would Leni cut it?” he muses out loud after watching one of his propaganda films, naturally meaning Leni Riefenstahl). Gags like these wrong-foot crybaby liberals but give a deadly serious nod and a wink to his base, as if to say, “Of course we’re extremely fascist! Isn’t it thrilling?”The heroes of this film are  journalist Paul Lewis, who politely declines to be bamboozled or alpha-dogged by Bannon, and Good Morning Britain’s Susanna Reid, who directly confronts Bannon about the deadly riot in Charlottesville. The utter creep is Bannon’s slimy Brit understrapper who takes his boss on a tour of London’s Edgware Road, traditionally and uncontroversially the home of Middle East businesses.

This is an anthro-leonine deepfake of impressive proportions, but the new Lion King gains in shock and awe while losing in character and wit. These are walking, talking animals that are realer than real and whose facialspeech patterns are eerily plausible – way past the unsatisfying oddities of Babe the pig from long ago, with moving mouths pasted on animal faces. Here once again is the story of the lion prince Simba (voiced by Donald Glover) who as a tiny cub is “presented” to his subjects in the ceremony on the phallic Pride Rock by his parents King Mufasa (in which vocal role James Earl Jones is a survivor of the original film) and Queen Sarabi (Alfre Woodard). But wicked Uncle Scar (did he have a real name before the nickname?) nurses evil designs on poor little Simba. Here the role originally played by Jeremy Irons has been given to Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is capably insinuating, but does not relish the evilness of the part in the same outrageous and enjoyable way Irons did. An evil plot and a tragedy mean Simba grows up in exile, where he must one day confront his destiny, helped by the young lioness he loves: Nala, voiced by Beyoncé.This is a virtual shot-for-shot reproduction of the original, and some credulous souls have been excitably posting side-by-side images on social media, showing the cartoon and its digital duplication. Have these people grasped that this is just an animation as well, and that director Jon Favreau has not in fact trained real animals to imitate scenes from the 1994 film? Maybe not.In some ways, I can’t blame them. This is very smooth work, adding half an hour to the original running time simply by unobtrusively plumping up each narrative part, although we get more of the backstory of Mufasa, Sarabi and Scar. We lose the quirkily eccentric Morning Report song from the pompous courtier-bird Zazu (originally Rowan Atkinson, now John Oliver) but Beyoncé’s Nala has a new song: Spirit.But we have also lost a couple of well-loved things from the first film: the ersionary “big pig” song from Pumbaa and Timon (voiced by Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner) has been junked and when grownup Simba and Nala sing their Can You Feel the Love Tonight? love song, Nala doesn’t do her startlingly sultry come-hither expression from the first film: perhaps the only purely erotic moment in the Disney canon. The new Lion King has been modernised in the sense of having more African and African-descended voice artists, and John Kani brings a lovely vocal lightness to the priestly role of Rafiki. Yet the new Lion King boldly keeps that famous stretch of dialogue from the first film in which the huntermeat-eater is presented as morally equivalent to the herbivore. Mufasa tells young Simba about all creatures being respected in a delicate balance, from the crawling ant to the leaping antelope. “But dad, don’t we eat the antelope?” asks Simba, and Mufasa replies sonorously: “Yes ... but when we die, our bodies become the grass, and antelopes eat the grass.” I always expect Simba to reply: “Erm, yeah, dad, but there’s a difference between dying of old age and getting killed and eaten in a state of terrified pain.” Simba embraces a kind of veganism in exile – but it’s the kind of immature practice that he will have to put behind him if he is to reclaim his crown.Basically, this new Lion King sticks very closely to the original version, and in that sense it’s of course watchable and enjoyable. But I missed the simplicity and vividness of the original hand-drawn images. The circle of commercial life has given birth to this all-but-indistinguishable digiclone descendant. I don’t quite feel like bowing, but respect has to be paid to a handsomely made piece of entertainment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9649cc5763b6fdb991e7e38f9c650695cc34eafc/0_650_2240_1344/master/2240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d87fd437c06b034c4b8354ab67f0ee15","title":"worst holidays in cinema ranked","story":"As Spiderman: Far From Home and Midsommar bring the well-worn trip-gone-wrong back to the big screen, here are 20 of film’s most appalling vacationsThe sequel to the film of the sitcom, The Inbetweeners 2 bravely wrestles with the question of which is more revolting, a faceful of someone else’s urine or a faceful of someone else’s faeces. Judging by all the vomiting that Will (Simon Bird) does after he receives the latter, the answer is faeces. But that’s not all the Brits abroad have to put up with in Australia. Neil (Blake Harrison) kills a dolphin, Simon (Joe Thomas) gets beaten up, and when their car runs out of fuel in the fiercely hot outback, it looks – for two whole hours – as if they will all die of dehydration.If you can forgive the less-than-PC depiction of the primitive islanders in the last reel, Buster Keaton’s most commercially successful film is also one of his most delightful. It’s not so much fun for the characters, though. Keaton stars as Rollo Treadway, a top-hatted toff who proposes to his neighbour (Kathryn McGuire). After she turns him down, he decides to go on their honeymoon cruise to Honolulu by himself, but they end up adrift together on a deserted liner. Highlight: Rollo fends off one swordfish by using another swordfish as a weapon.Any cultural study of British attitudes towards Europe should begin with an analysis of Carry on Abroad. This later, lesser entry in the series sends the regulars on a package holiday to the island of Elsbels (get it?) on the Costa Bomm (get it?). The hotel is unfinished and understaffed, the phones don’t work, sand pours from the taps, mosquitoes pour in through the windows and then, finally, the resort is washed away by a flash flood. No wonder the team opted for a British caravanning holiday three films later in Carry on Behind.By the time the middle-aged, middle-class Anna (Kathryn Worth) joins a group of friends in a rented Tuscan villa, the occupants have already split themselves into the “youngs” and the “olds”. Anna, of course, is relegated to the “olds”, but would much rather hang out with the “youngs”, the teenage Oakley (a pre-Loki Tom Hiddleston) in particular. Her discomfort may be mild compared with the physical pain suffered by some of the other holidaymakers on this list, but Joanna Hogg’s acute debut will be excruciating to anyone who has ever felt uncool and out-of-place.Actual holidays are a risky business, but virtual holidays can be just as hazardous. In Paul Verhoeven’s Total Recall, adapted from a Philip K Dick short story, We Can Remember It for You Wholesale, a construction worker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) pays to have the memories of a trip of a lifetime implanted in his brain. Unfortunately, the process reveals that he is really a secret agent with a history of Martian missions. Or maybe he really is a construction worker, and it’s the Martian missions that are all a fantasy. Either way, he won’t recall it as a relaxing break.We all know that Los Angeles is the safest place on Earth, while Paris is the most dangerous, so when 17-year-old Kim (Maggie Grace) tells her dad (Liam Neeson) that she is off to the city of light, the retired CIA agent assumes, quite rightly as it turns out, that she will be abducted by Albanian sex traffickers as soon as she steps out of Charles de Gaulle airport. You would think that poor Kim would stay in LA after that, but she heads to Istanbul in the sequel. Again, Dad’s “particular set of skills” are required.Recuperating from a throat operation, a rock star (Tilda Swinton) is napping on the beach in Pantelleria when the sun is blotted out by an aeroplane. Yes, trouble is flying her way, specifically, a hedonistic ex (Ralph Fiennes) who is hoping to seduce her, along with the ex’s daughter (Dakota Johnson), who is hoping to seduce her boyfriend (Matthias Schoenaerts). Luca Guadagnino’s sensual drama becomes a thriller when one character is drowned in a swimming pool, but before that it captures the blood-boiling annoyance of having uninvited guests butt in on your holiday.Open Water is a low-budget thriller with a chilling high concept: a scuba-ing husband and wife bob to the ocean’s surface, only to find that their shuttle boat has left them stranded, miles from the Australian coast, surrounded by sharks and jellyfish. What’s even more disturbing is that it is based on a true story, unlike the two otherwise superior films that followed in its wake: in Adrift (2006), six swimmers can’t reach the deck of a luxury yacht, and in Frozen (2010) – no relation to the cartoon – three skiers are trapped in a chair lift.A New Year’s Eve party is in full swing aboard the SS Poseidon when the ageing ship is capsized by a tsunami and the passengers experience what the pithy poster called: “Hell, upside down”. Still, what can you expect when Leslie “Naked Gun” Nielsen is your captain? All-star disaster movies may not win much critical respect, but between the lethal-looking practical effects, and the full-throated yelling by Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine et al, The Poseidon Adventure still holds water, especially compared with the CGI-heavy 2006 remake.Sometimes it’s not the holiday that’s the problem, it’s what’s going on while you’re away. In Stanley Donen’s Hitchcock-ish romp, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) is happy enough to be on a skiing trip, flirting with the handsome Peter (Cary Grant) and planning a orce. But when she gets back to her Paris apartment, she discovers that her husband has sold all of their possessions, run off with the money, got himself murdered, and set up Reggie as the target of three killers. And you thought it was grim to come home to a houseful of dead pot plants.Filmed in one breathtaking unbroken shot, an avalanche roars towards an Alpine ski resort’s restaurant terrace, where a picture-perfect family is having lunch. The husband (Johannes Kuhnke) sprints away, taking his phone and his gloves, but leaving behind his wife (Lisa Loven Kongsli) and their two children. No harm comes to anyone in Ruben Östlund’s superb Swedish comedy drama, but in that split-second of panic, the holiday is destroyed – and so is a family’s complacent image of itself. An American remake starring Will Ferrell and Julia Louis-Dreyfus is in the works.The series we might now subtitle “the crimes of Griswold” got started with this chaotic road movie, directed by Harold Ramis, written by John Hughes and starring Chevy Chase as Clark Griswold, a man who dreams of introducing his wife and children to the Walley World theme park. For a hit Hollywood comedy, National Lampoon’s Vacation is surprisingly subversive in its demolition of the archetypal all-American family holiday. And, as in so many of the films on this list, a pet dog doesn’t survive the journey.Maybe it’s not such a terrible holiday for Lenny (Charles Grodin). After all, it is while he is lounging in Miami Beach that he meets Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), a blonde goddess he imagines to be his soulmate. The only snag is that he happens to be on his honeymoon. As well as sensing that he and Kelly are not destined to live happily ever after, the viewer can’t help but feel sorry for Lenny’s bride, Lila (Jeannie Berlin). Played by the daughter of the film’s director, Elaine May, she isn’t just betrayed, she is sunburnt to a crisp and confined to her hotel room.“We’ve gone on holiday by mistake!” With that one glorious line, written by Bruce Robinson and snapped by a rain-sodden Richard E Grant, Withnail and I speaks for everyone who has ever been stuck in a dreary cottage in the middle of nowhere with no heating, no food and, at that stage, no access to the finest wines available to humanity. To their credit, Withnail (Grant) and his flatmate (Paul McGann) are resourceful enough to strangle, half-pluck and cook a chicken. But then Withnail’s Uncle Monty (Richard Griffiths) turns up, and things go from bad to worse.You have to hand it to David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne). In John Landis’s wonderful horror comedy, these two Americans eschew the tourist trail in favour of a hike on the Yorkshire moors and a pint in the Slaughtered Lamb (Brian Glover and Rik Mayall play two of the patrons). It’s just a shame that a hungry lycanthrope puts a crimp in their travel plans. Jack winds up as a decomposing ghost, and David – with a little help from Rick Baker’s game-changing prosthetic makeup – undergoes cinema’s most agonising man-to-beast transformation.Jordan Peele’s Us gave the “holiday-home invasion” subgenre a mind-boggling twist, but if any film is going to prompt you to install a security system in your lakeside getaway, it’s Michael Haneke’s Funny Games. From the moment two polite young psychopaths, Peter (Frank Giering) and Paul (Arno Frisch), knock on a family’s door and ask for eggs, the tension never slackens. Yes, Haneke’s nightmarish masterpiece is a postmodern comment of the viewer’s complicity in Hollywood screen violence. But, more importantly, it’s terrifying.Two American backpackers (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) are lured to Slovakia by the prospect of no-strings sex with the eager locals, and when they are maimed with power drills, chainsaws and blow torches instead, it’s hard to be all that upset. Critics were ided on whether Eli Roth’s Hostel was crass torture porn or a satirical caricature of American ignorance, but its gruesome vision of an exotic, treacherous Europe isn’t so different from what you can see at a cinema near you now in Midsommar or, for that matter, Spider-Man: Far From Home.Deliverance is a part of the language. Even if you haven’t seen John Boorman’s Oscar-nominated wilderness thriller, its title alone is enough to conjure up thoughts of savage mountain men, broken bones, twanging banjos and everything you else you might dread when you set off on a canoeing holiday, up to and including the phrase: “Squeal like a pig!” Ironically, despite all the unpleasantness endured by the film’s four Atlanta city-slickers (Burt Reynolds, Jon Voight, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox), Deliverance is so scenic that it turned its location, Rabun County in Georgia, into a tourism hotspot.When a petrol station attendant urges you to stay on the main road, be sure to listen. That’s the lesson we have been taught by countless backwoods-horror yarns. But Wes Craven’s The Hills Have Eyes was made long before the so-called “gas station of doom” became a much-loved and parodied trope, so we can’t blame the Carter family for ignoring the warnings and detouring into the desert. Cave-dwelling cannibals attack, the Carters fight back, and, as the trailer’s peerless tag line puts it: “The lucky ones died first.”10 best Hugh Grant films - ranked!Actors playing nightmarish versions of themselves in cinema - ranked!All Helen Mirren\u0027s 61 movies - ranked!Biopics trashed by families, friends and fans - ranked!Dog weepie movies - ranked!Emma Thompson\u0027s best films - ranked!Game of Thrones - every episode - ranked!James Bond on film – 007\u0027s best and worst movies - ranked!Judi Dench - every film - ranked!Michael Caine\u0027s best films - ranked!Movie Santa Clauses - ranked!Nicole Kidman’s top 10 films - ranked!Palme d\u0027Or winners - ranked!Purr evil: cats in movies with hidden agendas - ranked!Robert Redford\u0027s greatest screen roles - ranked!Ryan Gosling movies - ranked!Stanley Kubrick\u0027s best films - ranked!Star Wars - every film - ranked!The 10 best Glenn Close movies - ranked!The 10 best movie shark performances - ranked!The 20 best Marvel films - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The best and the worst Jennifer Lopez films - ranked!The best Shakespeare films - ranked!The Coen brothers’ films - ranked!The scariest horror films ever - ranked!Tom Cruise - top 20 movies - ranked!Top 10 Merchant Ivory films - ranked!Top 20 J-horror films - ranked!Winona Ryder\u0027s 20 best films - ranked!Worst holidays in cinema - ranked!10 best Paul Simon albums - ranked!20 greatest breakup songs ever - ranked!All 43 Spice Girls songs - ranked!All Abba\u0027s UK singles - ranked!Aphex Twin\u0027s best songs - ranked!Barry Manilow – all his greatest songs - ranked!Black Sabbath - every album - ranked!Bruce Springsteen\u0027s albums - ranked!Cher\u0027s 30 greatest songs - ranked!David Byrne – (almost) all of his albums - ranked!Elton John\u0027s 50 greatest songs - ranked!Every Mercury prize-winning album - ranked!Every one of Madonna\u0027s 78 singles - ranked!Giorgio Moroder\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Kanye West – every album - ranked!Kate Bush – every UK single - ranked!Lil Wayne\u0027s albums - ranked!Nirvana\u0027s 20 greatest songs - ranked!Queen\u0027s 50 UK singles - ranked!Stevie Wonder\u0027s albums - ranked!Taylor Swift\u0027s singles - ranked!The 20 best music documentaries - ranked!The 30 best boyband members - ranked!The best UK garage tracks - ranked!The best X Factor finalists - ranked!The greatest banned songs of all time - ranked!The greatest pop music dance crazes - ranked!The greatest Scottish indie bands - ranked!The Rolling Stones – every album - ranked!The Who: their UK singles - ranked!"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb4fa612ec37b5a99dd5650482adb85787a92e57/0_371_7313_4388/master/7313.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61847850da59218640ba97b2a66dfba0","title":"dont ask your waiter what to order and other ways to be a perfect diner","story":"It’s not just rudeness that upsets restaurant staff. Too much deference can be almost as badI had my first waitressing job in Chancery Lane, a very lawyer-heavy corner of London, in 1991. I had been hired specifically to flog dessert wine at the end of the meal, and I learned the following: if people want dessert wine, they ask for it. Getting a person who doesn’t already want it to drink tokay is like getting a baby to take an antibiotic – you would basically have to squirt it into their mouths with a syringe. I also learned every single way in which a lawyer can be rude to a waiter: the cross-examination (“Why on earth would I want dessert wine?”) the stonewall the sneering grandeur (“We’re actually in the middle of a conversation”). What is wrong with these people, I always thought. They can surely see that I’m not doing this on my own account.After that, I had a couple of waiting jobs that were OK – corporate events in museums, where everyone was wild with excitement because they were going to snog someone from HR, and you couldn’t put a foot wrong – but realised quite quickly that if you wanted to be treated like an equal, you had to work in a pub. Indeed, drinkers treat you like an equal at the beginning of the night, and by the end, they are treating you like some kind of angel. Diners, gone bad, are the opposite: you’re staff at the beginning and a serf at the end.This is at the kernel of most significant crimes against waiting staff: treating them as irritating accessories to the dining experience, like wasps. In my wide-ranging focus group (Twitter) on what waiters hate now, nearly 30 years later, it’s all in this category: clicking your fingers saying you’ve decided and then making someone stand next to you like a lemon while you actually decide not making eye contact, especially when you pass back the payment machine (the message of which is especially chilling: this transaction is over, ergo you, waiting person, have ceased to exist). Lots of people said they do a Fawlty Towers when someone’s fingers click – look under the table and say: “Is there a dog under there?”There are strategies galore for dealing with rudeness, which mostly end with a waiter spitting in your food, but the main reason you should behave properly as a diner is that you are human and so are they. You have to do more than not be rude yourself, incidentally you have to be a good ally and police rudeness on your table. I would never eat with anyone who made waiters wait for the sake of it.It may shock and appal you to learn that there are behaviours you think are harmless that waiters hate: folding crisp packets (this is more gastropub behaviour) into tiny squares and wedging them into crevices, bottle necks and suchlike ripping up napkins into tiny pieces and sprinkling them about (I have some sympathy for this – it’s the kind of thing you might do on a terrible date instead of sticking a fork into your own eye – however, don’t do it). Some of these are ways you think you’re “helping”, such as piling an extra plate on to an existing pile, or handing something to someone when they are already laden. “I’m actually trained at this,” one waiter told me. “I know exactly how many plates I can get on to each arm and in what formation.” Chuck a rogue knife into that, and you’re essentially saying: “I have no conception of the amount of skill involved in your work.”It’s annoying, however, when you overdo your respect, such as asking the waitress what she would order. There are restaurants where the staff have tasted everything, a mark of mutual respect and honour between employer and employee, but there are heaps of places where the waiters are just given a bowl of pasta at the end of a shift, and they don’t bloody know what you should order, between the chicken parfait and the asparagus. Then they have to go: “The parfait is very popular,” and you’re in this opinion no-man’s-land – does that mean it’s good or that other people are stupid? – and you cannot either take the recommendation or politely reject it.Good diner behaviour is when you treat the staff as you would a member of your family who was bringing you some food: say please and thank you say thank you like you mean it move your phone when the food arrives, and anything else that is in the way wait until they are free before you stage a fresh request apologise when you spill if you are making a complaint, unless it’s one specifically about the service, frame it as constructive bitching about a mutual acquaintance rather than an accusation.At my first waiter interaction – “Can I bring you some water?” – I always say: “Nah, I’m all right.” It establishes the following: I am not a demanding person feel free to try and flog me some dessert wine later, if you like I intend to enjoy this occasion, by which I mean, really go for it. Of course it helps that I don’t like water."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4328f3ba8f7267620069caaa4fe129e525511551/0_51_5911_3547/master/5911.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6908b189d409062df54e75c7ae422d82","title":"dream holiday rental house decent kitchen knives jay rayner","story":"They’re never sharp, the coffee mugs are too small – and as for those glass chopping boards…Being a fully paid-up member of the acutely tasteful, exquisitely nuanced, belly-obsessed bourgeoisie is a dreadful struggle, and never more so than when summer holidays approach. For with the anticipation – of long lunches on bougainvillea-scented terraces with sea views, of chilled glasses of rosé as dusk falls – comes The Fear. It is the stomach-churning fear of the, oh God, ill-equipped kitchen.This year we have rented a house in Greece, and while I have flicked endlessly through the online photographs, imagining myself inhabiting the scene, it is the pictures of the kitchen I have lingered over, in search of signs. Except there never are any, because images like this are an exercise in advanced OCD. Any clutter, any objects which might leave clues, have been tidied away. I’m delighted there’s a wine fridge, obviously. But what I really need to know is this: what are the kitchen knives like?It’s a stupid question. Kitchen knives in rentals are always crap. They are never bought to be sharp and perfectly weighted. They are bought to look like kitchen knives, not to actually be them. I therefore start making a list of the things I’ll need to take with me, to make this the dream holiday that I’ve been playing out in my mind.Firstly, there really will have to be those kitchen knives from home. And while we’re at it what about a good chopping board? Too many rentals appear to think that glass chopping boards, which produce the sound of nails down a blackboard when the blade gets through the onion, are a good idea. They aren’t. A modest non-glass one wouldn’t go amiss would it. And a cafetière. Sure, there’s a coffee machine in the pictures but it will take me days to work out how to use one of those effectively. And don’t get me started on bloody Nespresso machines and their knock-offs. The coffee always comes out lukewarm.So yes, knives, a chopping board, a cafetière. And, of course, proper sized mugs, instead of those dismal thimbles they always have. I need a bucket of coffee in the morning. I don’t want to keep going back for refills. This is about my needs, and my needs are extremely detailed. Maybe I should take a Microplane. I don’t actually own one at the moment, but perhaps now is the time to get one just so I can take it with me on holiday, along with a really good corkscrew, a proper pair of tongs and …Which is when I begin to understand the attraction of caravanning. You don’t have to take kitchen equipment with you, because the kitchen is always there. Fabulous. Which is also when the words “what have I become?” flit across my mind. If buying a caravan is the answer it must be a pretty stupid question. Where’s my sense of adventure? Where’s my spirit of improvisation?In the trailer for Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted, his new series for National Geographic, he is seen climbing trees freestyle, scaling cliff faces and driving motorbikes along needle-thin mountain paths I do hope nothing awful happens to him. He’s also seen cooking with the barest bits of kit: sticks, flints, a machete and a barely sublimated fear of male inadequacy. I think to myself: “Maybe I should be more like Gordon.”Finally, I come to my senses. Anything which makes me conclude I should imitate Ramsay is a lost cause. It’s back to plan A. I don’t need that many clothes for a good summer holiday. I don’t really need shoes or books. But believe me, I really do need some good sharp knives. It’s time to get packing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a959b3d8953cc1306c3af250a77c2671d29f497a/4_103_6196_3719/master/6196.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea8be5b76c26edce20982e22dc6a7cd6","title":"how to eat fishcakes","story":"This month, How to Eat is making the zero-waste, full-taste case for the fish cake. But with chips? Or salad? Tartare or parsley sauce? And where should you stick that lemon wedge?But surely these breadcrumbed bad boys are due a revival? Not only is potato and fish one of food’s most enduring partnerships – a combination far greater than the sum of its parts, like Jagger and Richards or Cannon \u0026amp Ball – but, as a (potentially) protein-orientated outlet for leftovers such as stale bread or fish trimmings, fishcakes dovetail neatly with 2019’s focus on zero-waste, low-carb cooking.Luckily, How to Eat – the series stipulating how best to eat Britain’s favourite dishes – is here to cut through this thicket of gastronomic idiocy, and usher the fishcake back into polite society. Minus the bean shoots.Like an inability to coexist peacefully or a love of Mr Bean, the fishcake is one of those few things that unites all peoples of the world. Except in Yorkshire, where, typically, the locals have chosen to sandwich a piece of fish between two slices of potato, batter it, deep fry it and call it a fishcake. Delicious, but maverick. Obstinate, even.For the sake of its own sanity, rather than take a deep e into everything from Thai tod mun pla-krai to Danish fiskefrikadeller, How to Eat (HTE) will restrict itself here to what is broadly understood as the soft, potato-based, British-style fish cake.A patty ranging in diameter from an ice-hockey puck to a 7in single and no thicker than the average Le Carré paperback (the internationally recognised unit of fishcake measurement). Ideally prepared in a 45:55 potato-to-fish ratio (too much fish and it will lack a smooth, soothing texture), the fishcake should be shallow-fried. Oven baking is killing the fishcake as surely as home-taping was once killing music.As importantly, the fishcake must have a crisp breadcrumb coating. Merely flouring the cakes and, particularly, chilling the mixture and frying uncoated lumps of it in a pan, is scandalous. In many ways, the fishcake is all about the crumb: that moment when you take a knife and crack its carapace with an audible snap, the sight of steam gently venting from that new fissure sharpening the appetite and waking the senses with anticipation.In terms of the fishcake’s contents, its endless flexibility, its ability to harmoniously reconcile anything from naturally smoked haddock to tinned tuna, is its greatest strength. You would not fritter away pricy, delicately flavoured scallops or white crab meat in there (would you?), but otherwise, all bets are off. Or on. The differentiations in taste and texture between mashed potato and two or three types of (smoked) fish, are what make this dish sing.If you are using fillets of cod or such (get you!), then make larger cakes so that you can retain pieces of the flaked fish in the mix, rather than reducing it to a fibrous mush. In that way, smaller cakes are better suited to tinned fish and lesser, gelatinous cuts, the texture of which it is less important to retain. Do not stuff your cakes with dense, squidgy hot-smoked salmon, which tends to be a little dry if it is allowed to dominate.Beyond potato and fish, additions to the cake mix should be no more than seasoning. For instance, a few scattered capers or spring onions, a hint of grated horseradish or lemon zest. These should be a little tweak, a spritz, a vinegary tickle at the periphery. Ultimately and indeed, at times rather blandly, your fishcakes should taste most prominently of potato and fish.Other common additions are too assertive (boiled egg is too rich, gherkins too sharp), while adding grated vegetables to the fish cakes – salmon and courgette, mackerel and beetroot – is baffling. It ends up blurring and muffling the flavour of both fish and vegetable. Serve any vegetables on the side. You want their flavours to retain a clear, inidual presence.The correct formula for perfect fishcakes is: fishcakes + sauce + one vegetable side  ultimate pleasure.The sauce (think: similar viscosity to hollandaise) is essential because, without it, your fishcake will often be too dry. You cannot pack your cake with butter or creme fraiche or it will not hold together in the pan. Frequently it needs saucing, liberally. Like the chosen vegetable – fresh and sweet, earthy, metallic, clean – the sauce should add a layer of flavour that is, at once, complementary and distinct. It is a supporting actor working diligently to elevate the star of the show, the fishcake.Within that triangle of taste there is endless possibility for variation: from a classic cod-salmon fish cake with steamed spinach and a silky, chive-flecked beurre blanc via mackerel-forward cakes served with roasted beetroot and a warm horseradish cream to tuna cakes with a loose and oily salsa verde and smoky, grilled courgettes.Indeed, it is probably easier to discuss what patently does not work with fishcakes:Mushy peas With a fishcake? That is a whole lot of clag.Parsley sauce From 1980s school canteens to the freezer aisle, an unholy pallid gunk.Lemon wedges If you feel your fishcake needs a splash of lemon, work it carefully into the mix as a seasoning, rather than leaving people to haphazardly jet-wash patches of their plate with citrus.Tartare sauce Yes, it makes sense, in its flavours. But the fish cake is a much drier beast than fish and chips, where the glossy batter lubricates each mouthful. Tartare is too thick a condiment to work here.Tomato-based sauces HTE fully concedes that in southern France or Campania, there are probably people who can combine fish, onions, fresh tomatoes, garlic and olive oil in ways that would blow its tiny mind. But sadly, HTE was born in Manchester not Marseille, and early experiences of tired, mealy frozen cod in awful, flatly under-seasoned tomato stews have left it with a deep mistrust of the fish-tomato interface.This is further compounded by the fact that, just as tartare is too thick for fishcakes, cooked tomato sauces are often too thin and watery. Sit your fishcake in a moat of tomato sauce, rather than beurre blanc or hollandaise, and its bottom will become unappetisingly soggy. See also: tomato salsas, anything with a red pepper base, in fact any (gloopy, ill-defined) cooked sauce on the whole ratatouille-piperade flavour axis.Pesto Again, too thick (unless deployed in a cream of some sort) and too, well, pesto-y. The dominant flavour of any food involving pesto is pesto – and fantastic as that often is, it feels reductive here.“Hot sauce” Not everything needs chilli heat. Fishcakes, least of all.Cold salads Not only does pairing a fishcake with a cold salad create a potentially jarring jumble of flavours, but it is one of British food’s great fallacies that eating a cold salad alongside a warm main component is a desirable situation. Much less a cold salad that, sat in a warm sauce, has wilted in the heat, collapsing into its depths. There are exceptions to that rule. The fishcake is not one of them.No. No pointless frills. No fronds. No crisscrossed chives or (making a comeback, HTE notes with dismay), ornamental pea shoots.Food writers will tell you that, cooked from scratch, this is a “casual supper”, displaying a level of pre-planning, free time and skill in the kitchen that may be beyond we mere mortals. You cannot throw fishcakes together in two minutes. With chilling time, you are talking an hour to 90 minutes of intermittent work. HTE has no problem with that, but let us not pretend that any of us are going to go the full Nigel Slater on a Tuesday lunchtime.No, despite it often being decried as a thrifty, homespun meal of offcuts, HTE would contend that making fishcakes for a midweek tea is making a relative effort to impress. Indeed, HTE would have no problem serving fishcakes at a dinner party*, as a starter. They can be as classy as you care to (and can afford to) make them.* HTE has never knowingly held a “dinner party” – a hideous concept. But that is a story for another time.Flat plate. Using vogueish wide, shallow bowls is misguided here. You need to be able to wield your knife and fork freely, rather than being impeded by any “lip”.Crisp white, cold beer, a strong cup of tea.So fish cakes, how do you eat yours?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0b36a4711db093c6d5c05b5fa3e3f683f6d1f78/0_0_2016_1344/master/2016.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=132e8f2cc09879d39739e58c40cb93fe 1760w","title":"madagascar v tunisia africa cup of nations quarter final live","story":"Algeria win the toss and choose to take the first penalty ...ET 120+3: Delort does take the freekick ... and he curls it around the wall and just wide!

Or maybe he’s going to take the free?ET 120 min: Comora es late into a tackle on Ounas, the player who was introduced for Mahrez. The defender gets a booking and Algeria get a freekick right at the edge of the area. Can they win it now and spare themselves a shootout? ET 116 min: Gradel swings in a freekick from the left.

ET 108: Ivory Coast have been the better side in extra-time. Mahrez, since you ask, was withdrawn in the 86th minute. ET 106 min: Cornet has been excellent since his introduction and has just skinned Benlamru down the left before flashing the ball across the face of goal.

Behold:ET 105 min: An Ivorian corner provokes a kinghell stramash in the Algerian box, and Zeffane clears off the line!

After a terrific second half, extra-time hasn’t yet caught fire. Both teams are wary of making a fatal mistake ... ET 2 min: Zaha, who had a decent game despite one bad miss, is withdrawn for Cornet. Meanwhile, Bounedjah was replaced by Slimani shortly after his penalty miss but is still distraught. The camera keeps panning to him in the dugout, where he is shaking his head and seemingly on the verge of tears. You’d almost want Algeria to go on and win here just to save him from further distress. Before we tuck into the main feast (see below), let’s enjoy the conclusion to the first quarter-final, which is turning out to be a corker. Algeria led through a first-half goal by Sofinae Feghouli and had a chance to increase that lead, only for Baghdad Bounedjah to smash a penalty against the crossbar. Then Jonathan Kodjia equalised for Ivory Coast and since then it’s been a thrilling, helter-skelter affair, with highlights including Riyad Mahrez having a shot cleared off the line brilliantly by Mamadou Bagayoko, and Wilfried Zaha shaking a golden chance high and wide for the Elephants. A highly entertaining game is about to reach its climax, as extra-time begins momentarily... Hello. We are gathered here today to see whether Madagascar can spring yet another wonderful surprise. The team who began this tournament ranked 108th in the world have lit up the show with a marvellous spirit, canny defending and vibrant attacking. They’ve been beautiful! Today, Tunisia stand in their way. “It doesn’t matter who we’re up against, we’re not worried about that!” blared Malgasy midfielder Lalaina “Bolida” Nomejanahary by way of preview for this match. “We approach every game with a winning mentality.” That’s the spirit! Still, let’s remind ourselves of what Tunisia (world ranking: 25) will be bringing to this party. Far more experience than Madagascar, for a start, but also some nimble tricksters and a more open disposition than is suggested by a record of four draws from four matches so far. Youssef Msakni, Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti have not been at their best so far in this tournament (and Khazri and Sliti did not start the last game) but if they get it together, they could lead Madagascar on a merry dance. Both these teams are technically slick and fond of open and enterprising games so this could be a belter. Senegal will be paying close attention because they will meet the winner in the semi-final. You, too, should tune in. It’s on!

Putting that extra money into an ISA or an investment portfolio, however, could make a real differencePutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

Taking it back on tour, she talks about her pride at its effect – and the regret that it made her life public property A few years ago, I lay in my garden on a hot summer’s day, listening to a few familiar notes of a song wafting over from next door. As it reached the chorus, I mimed along. When my neighbour played it for a third time, I was tempted to shout: “You OK?” I knew they weren’t: anyone listening constantly to kd lang’s Constant Craving, a paean to longing and desire, was surely in the throes of a deep and unrequited crush.The track, released in 1992, is the last on lang’s second album, Ingénue. The Grammy award-nominated, multi-platinum-selling album became a cultural milestone – it hoisted LGBT issues firmly into the mainstream, and subverted country music, which was then the preserve of a far smaller, more conservative audience. Ingénue is meditative and personal, its vulnerability and honesty resonating strongly.Now 57, lang is about to embark on a UK tour called Ingénue Redux, where she will play the album in its entirety. “The first time I listened back, after 25 years, was when we were rehearsing,” she says, speaking from her home in Calgary. “I thought: ‘Ugh, this is not going to be easy. It’s a dirge, it’s so slow.’” But when she had completely relearned the album: “It felt like putting on an old pair of shoes.”Each note of the record is as clean and brilliant as polished marble each instrument is given room to breathe the lyrics are clear, so there is no misunderstanding of her message. “We were sticklers for the sonic cleanliness of that album,” she says. While her first album, 1988’s Shadowland, had a much stronger country flavour, Ingénue adds a cabaret influence. But its momentous success nearly was not to be.In 1992, Kathryn Dawn Lang came out as gay during an interview with the Advocate, an LGBT magazine, while promoting the album. Some radio stations stopped playing her music she felt ostracised by the country music industry. In 1993, she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair. She had continuously played up to, and cultivated, her androgynous looks – rocking a teddy-boy quiff and often a loosely tailored suit on stage. For the magazine shoot, she appears in a barber’s chair, her tie loosened around her neck, with her face being shaved by Cindy Crawford. The image is disruptive, beautiful and poignant: it’s no longer a man’s world. “Elvis lives, and she’s beautiful,” Madonna said at the time.“I was surprised when I heard a rumour that I’d slept with Madonna,” lang chuckles. “I was completely oblivious to it.” How did she feel about being the centre of so much attention? “It’s a byproduct of showbusiness. And really, that’s one of the reasons I don’t like participating in showbusiness.”She says she spends a lot of time with her mother and partner. She cooks – “I’m a great home chef” – and is a practising Buddhist, with her own meditation room. A keen advocate for the animal rights group Peta, she has been vegetarian since she was 19. After seven studio and six collaborative albums, the allure of the music business has dimmed. “I’m excited to tour because, to me, it’s just about singing for people. But it has not ignited a deep thrust to make more music.”It must have been hard, so much of her life being public property. “I grew up with the adage that there is a wealth of purpose in being mysterious,” she says. “And I feel like I haven’t had the chance to be mysterious. My sexuality, and everything, was so much out in the open, and has been for many years. I feel exhausted by being exposed. And it’s truly not that interesting!” She tails off with a laugh.Although it might not seem interesting to her, at the time lang came out, she pretty much represented an entire section of society. The early 90s were a fallow time for famous lesbians – she quickly became a sapphic north star. As someone who was barely scraping into their teens when Ingénue was released, I was aware of lang, although I don’t think I had heard her music. Awareness of her existence allowed me to realise that there was another choice available apart from heterosexuality.Does she recognise that she opened the door for others to walk through? “Um, yeah, although I try not to take huge credit for that because it’s not a competition. It’s something bigger than all of us. I am certainly proud, but at the same time, I’m just one of many. Gay culture isn’t just one sliver of humanity – it’s a huge cross-section of people.”Pop is one of the few cultural movements where the young are ascribed more power than the old. Often, it can feel like young pop stars are given credit for things lang was doing well before they were born: playing with gender and image, blurring the lines between what it is to be masculine or feminine. There is obviously still a power in the subversion, but do they have to fight in the way that she did? A pause. “Women are still fighting, and people of colour are still fighting, and gay people are still fighting.”I mention the recent homophobic assault of two women on a London bus and how it showed that there is still a lot of work to be done. “The bottom line is that everyone wants to feel accepted, including the guys that inflicted the violence,” lang says. “They feel threatened by women who chose to be with women because society has constructed this game plan – right now, there are so many rightwing forces at work providing and fuelling hatred.”While writing Ingénue, lang hoped it would stand the test of time, and it has. In the meantime, humanity has changed LGBT rights have advanced enormously, although still not enough. Desire and vulnerability remain constants. Heartbreak makes you who you are. Feeling you don’t belong is universal – and there is a paradox in feeling “seen” by a poetic outsider.

He evolved the character in 1973, ushering in the era of Aladdin Sane.Ziggy isn’t the only visitor to outer space commemorated by Mattel this week. The company also announced a one-off Barbie doll honouring Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti – whose 199-day mission on the International Space Station in 2014 was then the longest by a woman – as part of its Dream Gap Project.

But this once-powerful businessman is now caught up in a sweeping inquiry that goes to the heart of how a nation is run. By  Mark GevisserOn 17 January this year, South Africans watched, transfixed, as video from a hidden mobile phone camera was broadcast on TV. It showed a group of men, in corporate uniforms, walking into a vault – where one of them counts out bundles of banknotes: “One, two, three, four, five … bloody Monopoly money,” he laughs through heavy breaths, “must be a million.”The man’s name is Gavin Watson, and the whistleblowers who put this video into the public domain claim it shows him counting out bribes to be paid to officials in the South African government. They have given accounts that implicate cabinet ministers, senior lawmakers and even the prosecutors tasked with investigating the corrupt practices of Watson’s logistics company, Bosasa. The video is the most dramatic evidence yet of corruption within the ruling African National Congress (ANC).But Watson is not just another fat-cat industrialist accused of trying to make a fast buck by bribing officials: his family were legendary in the anti-apartheid movement. He is the oldest of four brothers from the Eastern Cape province, white men who became heroes to the black majority when they broke apartheid laws to play rugby with black people in 1976. They joined the banned ANC and faced numerous depredations by the apartheid state, including time in jail and assassination attempts.The youngest brother, Daniel (known as Cheeky), was the most gifted wing player of his generation, who gave up a Springboks blazer for his stand against apartheid. All four brothers left their whites-only teams and went to play for the black league in their home town, Port Elizabeth, one of the only parts of the country where black people as well as white were rugby-mad. In 2012, Cheeky Watson received a state honour for his fearless contribution to non-racial sport.Watson and his brothers owned a highly successful chain of menswear shops, aimed at black buyers. As white people with resources, they provided invaluable support to their black ANC comrades in the Eastern Cape. At a time when many freedom fighters espoused a racially exclusive “black consciousness” agenda, they also helped set the ANC’s non-racial policies in motion on the sportsfield.After the ban on the ANC was lifted in 1990, the Watson brothers became powerbrokers in both politics and business. They set up companies, fronted by black owners and managers, that obtained shares in mining companies and contracts from the state. “Black economic empowerment” (or BEE) is the state’s primary means of economic redistribution, an affirmative-action plan stipulating that anyone wishing to do business with the state has to have a certain quota of black ownership and management. On paper, Gavin Watson’s company, Bosasa, was majority black-owned as such, it garnered contracts worth $140m from the state between 2000 and 2016, from prison catering to fleet management and information technology.According to the testimony of four whistleblowers, all former Bosasa executives, around $5m was paid in bribes to secure these contracts. They allege an industrial-scale operation that generated cash through money laundering and then distributed it to buy influence, secure contracts and prevent prosecution. They have described cash stuffed into Louis Vuitton handbags as gifts, or handed over in monthly instalments on the sides of highways. State officials received cars and houses free security equipment and school fees for their children – even monthly meat supplies.Jacob Zuma, the former president, has been named in testimony as allegedly receiving gifts from Watson and playing a role in stopping the prosecution of his company, which first came under investigation in 2007. And even Cyril Ramaphosa, the current president, elected on the promise that he would sweep away corruption, unwittingly accepted a donation from Watson to help him in his campaign to unseat Zuma Bosasa also paid Ramaphosa’s son Andile a consulting fee for “advisory services”.Black economic empowerment aims to give black people a greater share of an economy still overwhelmingly owned by whites. But the evidence given to the inquiry against Gavin Watson and Bosasa suggests how easily manipulated it can be: the accusation against Watson is that he and his colleagues have abused the system to line their own pockets, and have “captured” the organs of state to do so.“State capture” has become a buzzword in South Africa. It describes the way private iniduals and companies have commandeered organs of state to redirect public resources into their own hands, and have gutted those institutions responsible for protecting the country against such corruption. These include the police, the prosecution authority, the tax collection service and even parliament itself.If the whistleblowers’ evidence is correct, Bosasa was a textbook case of state capture. They presented the vault video, along with a blizzard of documents and allegations, at South Africa’s independent judicial inquiry into allegations of state capture, corruption and fraud in the public sector, chaired by the country’s deputy chief justice, Raymond Zondo. Zondo began public hearings last August, and they are expected to continue, almost daily, until the end of this year. The state capture commission, as it is known, has been described as a truth and reconciliation commission for our times. Its aim is to cleanse post-apartheid South Africa of its darkest stain, just as Desmond Tutu sought to bring about a healthy transition into the new era by exposing the apartheid years’ gross violations of human rights.The commission’s primary target is the kleptocracy that established itself around the former president Jacob Zuma, and particularly the dealings of another band of brothers, the Guptas, who allegedly ran Zuma’s government as a private piggy-bank. Zuma himself will finally appear before Zondo next week: he is scheduled to be in the witness box for five days, answering questions primarily about his relationship with the Guptas and the decisions that arose out of this. But he is expected to address the allegations about Bosasa and Gavin Watson, too.Gavin Watson has declined to make any public comment since the allegations, but his brother Valence told me: “Our constitutional rights have been trampled upon.” Valence claims that his family are victims of a “dark state” conspiracy today, just as they were under apartheid. He claims that the commission is illegal, in that it has not offered those implicated by the whistleblowers a fair hearing.Although the whistleblowers have implicated all four brothers in their testimony before the commission, only Gavin is directly linked to Bosasa. On the basis of the tax-evasion allegations put before the commission, Gavin is now being investigated by the South African Revenue Service. And in an unrelated case, a high court has found him to have “acted dishonestly and reprehensibly” in a mining deal, by taking shares allocated to a “black economic empowerment entity and appropriating them to himself and his family”.The whistleblowers’ testimony sketches one of the most troubling dynamics of post-apartheid South Africa: as some freedom fighters went into politics and others went into business, support networks morphed into patronage networks, which in turn became criminal syndicates.The Watson brothers were such celebrities in the 1980s that there was even a TV series about them in the works. In a world where rugby was “next to God”, John Pilger wrote in an introduction to a 1997 book about them, they “embodied almost everything that white South African men liked about their breed: they were physically brave … men’s men. Even their Christianity fitted the mould. But their manliness and their faith embraced a universal humanity and morality that was the antithesis of this stereotype.”Television only came to South Africa in 1975, and at the time the Watsons were making news for their stand, the country was obsessed with Dallas, the Texas oil saga that centred on the Ewing family. “They were just like the Ewings,” the former journalist Cate Turner, who fell into their orbit, said to me. “I was starstruck. The Herald had them on the front page every other day: these compelling, good-looking guys and their wives with big hair and shoulder pads.”While Cheeky managed black rugby teams and Gavin ran the family business, the other two brothers, Ronnie and Valence, became underground operatives of the ANC. Ronnie, Valence and Cheeky spent four months in jail after they were charged with burning down their grand family home in an insurance fraud. They insisted the state had framed them, and were eventually acquitted. Their chain of stores, Dan Watson American Imports, had been phenomenally successful, but they went bankrupt shortly after the trial. It took them several years, after the fall of apartheid, to re-establish themselves as BEE entrepreneurs – and to bring many of their old comrades with them, into the business world.Recently, on a visit to Port Elizabeth, I met one of their former comrades, Mike Xego, a former political prisoner who is now a businessman. He drives a Mercedes with the plates “Mr X”, a moniker he also has stitched on to a necktie that is almost as broad as his language. “You must understand, black people are fucking poor,” he exploded, when I asked him why corruption had become so rife in South Africa. “Our ambitions! We wanted to be proper human beings, with bank accounts and a tie. We thought we would be strutting up and down the streets. Then things really crumbled. It didn’t go well for most of us. We remained where we were.”South Africa was recently declared by the World Bank to be the world’s most unequal country. In the boom years after the 1994 transition away from apartheid, if you were fortunate enough to be politically connected, you could soar into the stratosphere of the very wealthy via canny partnerships with white capitalists. This was Cyril Ramaphosa’s route. But, many black people were unable to access these opportunities, writes the South African sociologist Karl von Holdt, “because of political gatekeeping or because they lacked the capital or the skills”. And so “an alternative, informal political-economic system” emerged, through which “networks of state officials, ambitious entrepreneurs and small-time operators, were rigging tenders or engaging in other kinds of fraud … to sustain or establish businesses, or simply to finance self-enrichment”. Von Holdt argues that for some South Africans, criminality has become the route to class mobility.Of course, white South Africans had accumulated their wealth through their own affirmative-action programmes – job reservation for whites – and alliances with the state. Now, post-apartheid, BEE had two distinct, legitimate arms: the private sector handed over some of its assets to players like Ramaphosa in return for political access and government work, and the state set race quotas for public sector contracts and mining licences.The entrepreneurial – white – Watson brothers, seeing how they could parlay their political networks into deals, went down both tracks. Gavin built Bosasa, a company initially founded by leaders of the ANC Women’s League, to gain a foothold in the economy through government business. His younger brothers Valence and Ronnie went into the mining sector, working with a controversial family who bankrolled the ANC Youth League, and bought up marginal goldmines that the big players were getting ready to shut down.To find partners in these ventures, the brothers dug into their political hinterland: they recruited former comrades from ANC intelligence, rugby buddies from the black leagues, Eastern Cape activists. Gavin and Valence gave a major stake in their own companies to a man everyone calls “the fifth brother”, Archie Mkele, a black rugby legend they befriended when they crossed over to the black league. Mkele was severely burned in the Watsons’ 1986 fire, and then tortured into a confession that he had torched the house for his friends as part of the alleged insurance scam in court, he refused to testify against them. The other suspect, another black rugby mate, turned state witness, but was discharged after evidence emerged that he, too, had been tortured.Bosasa’s other major black shareholder is Mkele’s ex-wife, Carol, the sole beneficiary of a “women’s investments” trust. On paper, the Mkeles are very rich indeed, but they lead modest lives in Port Elizabeth: Carol – now named Muneira Oliveria – has a mid-level management job at Bosasa Archie is a priest. The whistleblowers allege in their testimony to the inquiry that the Mkeles’ investment trusts are fronts for Gavin Watson’s own family.Several of the Watsons’ other BEE partners became part of the country’s new political elite there was a revolving door, in these first years of the new government, between political appointments and BEE entrepreneurs. “The minute you have a system where people make money just by the connections they have, rather than the work that they do, the system is ripe for abuse,” says the political economist Moeletsi Mbeki, long a staunch critic of BEE. “It’s a recipe for corruption.”But a perfect storm was brewing: the aspirations that accompanied democracy were maturing at the same time as South Africa’s post-apartheid growth spurt slowed down, and the economy slumped after the global crash of 2008. As unemployment became more severe, public-service salaries and social welfare grants had to feed an increasing number of people. And as the cost of living soared, it became harder for many people to keep a foothold in the middle class: paying off the mortgage on your home keeping your kids in private schools.Central to this political economy is the ANC itself, which makes key appointments, from a local to a national level, except in those few parts of the country where it is no longer in power. The party subsists on donations, and there have been allegations that votes for leadership positions are for sale. There are no controls over campaign financing in South Africa, and so an operation like Bosasa can work on two levels: underground, through bribery, and above board, through making high-profile donations to the party, or running and staffing – as Bosasa did – huge campaign “war rooms” for the ANC out of its head office.“It is impossible to quantify the level of corruption in South Africa,” David Lewis of Corruption Watch, the South African chapter of Transparency International, told me, “but everyone accepts a perception, which is often the only way you make a judgment, that bribery in order to procure public contracts is ubiquitous.”A young business colleague of Mike Xego’s had accompanied him to our meeting, and when “Mr X” jumped up to take a phone call, I struck up a conversation with this man. He was trying to make a go of it, he told me, bringing potatoes from farms to market in his truck, and carrying fuel back. “But the problem is capital.” He had begun his business by bidding for state tenders, and received a sub-contract helping to build a road in his home township. But as soon as he made enough money to buy his truck, he got out of there.Why did he leave if he was doing so well there, I asked, and if state contracts could build his capital base?Judge Raymond Zondo is a mild and ponderous man in his late 50s who runs his commission with a sometimes-exasperating deliberateness. After viewing the video of Gavin Watson counting out those bundles of banknotes in the vault, he asked his witness – former Bosasa executive Angelo Agrizzi – what Watson had meant by referring to the cash as “monopoly money”.Agrizzi told the judge that he had experienced a Damascene conversion after surviving a heart tumour. The Watson camp suggests, with evidence, that he was trying to blackmail Gavin Watson. Agrizzi, in turn, claims Watson was going to throw him under the bus, and so he acted pre-emptively. Certainly, Agrizzi appears to have accumulated evidence, perhaps as insurance. He kept meticulous coded records: of the transfer of orders of “chicken”, or of “bread” in and out of the “oven”, as the vault was known – in what he liked to call his “little black books”, personalised and gold-embossed from Smythson in London. Even the state capture commission’s own secretary, a senior justice department official named Khotso De Wee, was to be found in these books, and had to be put on special leave by Zondo. De Wee has denied the allegations.Two characters were inscribed every month into Agrizzi’s dirty little ledger as “Snake” and “Snail”. Agrizzi told the commission that these were Nomgcobo Jiba, the deputy national director of public prosecutions and Lawrence Mrwebi, who headed a unit of the prosecuting authority that had, in fact, been investigating Bosasa since 2010. Agrizzi’s testimony suggested why, almost a decade later, no one had yet been charged: in his account, Jiba and Mrwebi were paid off to obstruct the prosecution – and even to advise the accused on how to circumvent the charges.Both Mrwebi and Jiba have denied Agrizzi’s allegations, and claim they never received money from Bosasa. In April, they were fired by Cyril Ramaphosa, on the basis of another judicial commission that found they had brought the agency into disrepute: not over Bosasa, but other matters that had to do with protecting Jacob Zuma and his cronies from charges of corruption.Shortly after Agrizzi made his revelations before the commission in January this year, the National Prosecuting Authority snapped into gear under a new boss. Although the state capture commission offers protection from self-incrimination, prosecutors used the charge sheet that had been gathering dust at the agency to arrest Agrizzi and two other Bosasa whistleblowers, as well as two prison officials.One of Agrizzi’s co-accused is a man named Linda Mti, an ex-ANC military commander who was the head of security at the 2010 South Africa World Cup and, before that, the country’s prisons commissioner. Hard-driving and charismatic, Mti is still known by his nom de guerre, “Richman”. He likes to tell the story of how, one day in 1980, while he was working out of the neighbouring country of Lesotho, two conservatively dressed young white men were brought to see him. His mother had joked that he might live to see the day that he could tell a white man what to do, and “now I’ve got two. My whiteboys!”The men were Ronnie and Valence Watson, and they had come to Lesotho at the behest of Chris Hani – the legendary ANC leader, who was later assassinated – smuggling forged documents across the border in their big white Mercedes. Mti became their handler, and in the years that followed, the Watson boys shuttled fleeing activists across the same border, along with intelligence reports about what was happening back home. Both Mti and Hani became close personal friends of the Watsons.When, in 1987, an attempt was made on Ronnie Watson’s life in a hotel room in Botswana, it was Richman Mti who came running to his aid. Three years later, when the last white president, FW de Klerk, unexpectedly unbanned the liberation movements and Mti came back to Port Elizabeth, his hometown, he had nowhere to live. Valence Watson put him up, and he lived there for many months. Mti was elected the first ANC chair of the region the brothers became his fixers and advisers. (Mti declined to speak to me for this story.)Mti became prisons commissioner in 2001, a year after Gavin Watson bought Bosasa: the company provided catering for mine hostels, and ran two detention centres, one for illegal immigrants and one for juvenile offenders. Watson was ready to expand. His man was in place.The state had never previously outsourced its prisons contracts, but inspired by the success of British companies such as G4S and Serco, Bosasa made a pitch to Mti and another senior prison official, Patrick Gillingham, for all the catering contracts in the country’s prisons. According to testimony given to the inquiry and the charge sheet, both men conspired to award Bosasa the prison catering contracts, for which they received lucrative kickbacks, in cash and in kind.A senior career official in the apartheid-era prisons service, Gillingham would have been a strong candidate for prisons commissioner were it not for the timing of the transition to democracy, and the ANC’s affirmative-action policies: he is white. When Agrizzi was trying to explain how he, too, became corrupt while working for Bosasa, he told Zondo: “We were constantly told that we were white males and that you will not find a job anywhere out there … This was drummed into our heads.” Similar statements were made by the other whistleblowers, all white men too. I have seen a video in which Watson does, indeed, emphasise to his white staff their unemployability in a changing South Africa.And so, according to the testimony before the state capture commission, Watson played race two ways. He offered his black collaborators a quicker route to self-enrichment than might otherwise be available to them, and his white ones a solution from the impoverishment they imagined might befall them, now that black South Africans were in the ascendant.When Mike “Mr X” Xego was released from five years in jail on Robben Island in 1982, he was 22 and had no clothes his mother, a domestic worker, could not help. “Go to the Watsons!” he was told. “They will make you look good.” Even before they became rugby heroes, the brothers were renowned in Port Elizabeth’s black community for their shop, which sold the kind of American fashion beloved by urban black South Africans. Most of the customers were black, but white people shopped there too, meaning it was one of the few mixed spaces in the city, a free zone for black people, and a safe space for activists. With their resources, the Watsons did what they could, setting up a makeshift clinic in the storeroom and tending to comrades injured in protests photocopying banned literature gifting clothes to released prisoners like Xego or returned exiles like Richman Mti.Xego acquired his first wardrobe – on credit, with no interest – from the Watsons. A few weeks later, all four brothers showed up in their Mercedes at his tiny township home and sat down to tea with his mother, winning her over with the fluent Xhosa they had learned growing up on an Eastern Cape farm. They wrote off his debt.Port Elizabeth had always been the heart of the freedom struggle and it was here, after the apartheid president PW Botha declared his state of emergency in 1985, that a nationwide consumer boycott of white businesses was most successful. What to do with the Watsons, though?At first they were exempt, but the boycott leaders insisted that they needed to be included: it would be too easy for other retailers to superficially imitate the Watson packaging. Worse yet, vigilantes were enforcing the boycott with violence. If people were found breaking the boycott by coming home from the shops with detergent, for example, they would often be forced to drink it. The only way people could be safe, the leaders insisted, was if the boycott was a blanket one. Others disagreed fervently: “To us the Watsons were not whites,” their friend Max Mamase told the Australian journalist Kristin Williamson. “They were part of us. But a few key people felt the Watsons were making money out of the boycott.”This was significant because of the factionalism in the struggle. You could tarnish your competitors with the slur that they were agents or informers. Ronnie Watson in particular was the master of this game: he had a favourite Xhosa word he would hiss under his breath about anyone who disagreed with him: inywagi – the genet, a small, wily wild cat that struck its prey with lightning speed. “Black or white, we were all spies to them,” Jack told me.The brothers stayed away from the above-ground movement, which was launched in 1983 as the United Democratic Front. When the journalist Gavin Evans set up a UDF affiliate with two other white activists, “they were very threatened,” Evans told me. “They liked to be the only white activists in the village. In various ways, they spread spy rumours about all three of us.”Obviously, Gavin Watson did not clothe people like Richman Mti in the 1980s in anticipation of a future lucrative relationship: no one could have predicted, back then, how quickly apartheid would fall and a new elite would establish itself. But the testimony before the state capture commission suggests a slippery slope: from comradely support into patronage and – in some cases – corruption.In this way, the Watson brothers are reminiscent of another famous struggle family, the Shaiks. The sons of an Indian trader from Durban, the Shaik brothers were deeply committed freedom fighters, and were often detained and even tortured. They answered directly to Jacob Zuma in exile, and they provided both intelligence and resources to the movement.The ANC’s leaders – in jail or in exile – had not a penny to their name, but were expected to take their seats at the negotiating table after their release or return after 1990, and talk themselves into power. Even Nelson Mandela was dependent on the largesse of local businessmen when he came out of jail, supported primarily by a brash insurance magnate named Douw Steyn (although there was no suggestion of an illegal relationship). Richman Mti had the Watsons. And Jacob Zuma had the Shaiks.Schabir Shaik bribed Zuma to get a piece of a multibillion dollar arms deal that South Africa signed with French and German companies in the mid-1990s. Shaik went to jail in 2005, and the reason Zuma is free is because a judge accepted testimony that the charges against him were tainted by political interference. This ruling was finally overturned on appeal in 2018, and the charges were reinstated: the former South African president may yet find himself behind bars.In an image-laundering exercise, Bosasa changed its name to African Global Operations in 2016. Its headquarters are a sprawling campus in a nondescript suburb west of Johannesburg. In its heyday the campus had wildlife roaming around it, a mini golf course, the Watson Corporate University, an evangelical publishing company and a wellness centre. Since the allegations made at the state capture commission earlier this year, the company has lost most of its business and gone into liquidation: most of its staff have been retrenched and its banks have refused to do business with it. Most of the campus’ buildings are dark, and it now has an unkempt air at odds with the regimental Watson style.Gavin Watson liked to call Bosasa a “Kingdom company”: he ran it with a kind of entrepreneurial evangelism. All staff were required to wear smart uniforms, and Watson conducted prayer meetings and offered communion every morning between 6am and 8am. A popular public speaker on behavioural science who ran the wellness centre for over a decade, Denise Bjorkman, says that Bosasa was “a cultish environment” with Watson its domineering leader, and that his “control mechanisms extended into prayer”, as staff members felt compelled to attend if they wished to be in favour. “Attendees had to pray out loud as he believed that if they did so he would know what they were thinking,” Bjorkman says.In April this year, Valence Watson agreed to spend a day with me, first in the Port Elizabeth offices of his lawyers, and then showing me Royalston, the magnificent “coastal wildlife residential estate” he is developing outside the city. He is known to be the most affable of the four bluff brothers: he was good company, despite the difficult conversation.Valence explained the family ethos to me, and how it was rooted in both enterprise and Christianity. His farming parents, descendants of hardy Scots settler stock, also ran trading stores, and there were two biblical precepts that governed their lives: “Love your neighbour as yourself” and “Earn your money by the sweat of your brow”. For the Watsons, “everyone’s money was the same colour”, and the first time he realised it was different elsewhere was when he noticed a wall in the local butchers, iding black and white shoppers.Although all four brothers are implicated by the whistleblowers at the state capture commission, Valence insisted to me that they had no relationship with their brother Gavin’s company Ronnie said the same thing, in a written response to questions. (Cheeky declined to talk to me.) There is, indeed, no evidence that they were directly involved in corruption, except for Agrizzi’s allegation that he saw Valence bribing a senior parliamentarian named Cedric Frolick on behalf of Bosasa. Valence dismissed this charge to me as a lie.Still, everyone who knows the Watson family notes the way the brothers band together, particularly in times of trouble. Perhaps because of the way they were once isolated by other whites as kaffirboeties (“nigger-lovers”) and then targeted by the authorities, they tend to close ranks and keep to themselves, and in my own dealings with them – perhaps exacerbated by their current embattled status – I experienced their notorious “us-versus-the-world” paranoia.“Stratcom” is short for “Strategic Communications”, the apartheid security forces’ notorious dirty tricks department, which sought to discredit key apartheid activists. (Stratcom may have been responsible, for example, for burning down the Watson house and then manufacturing documents to make it look like an insurance scam.) When I asked Valence who might be behind such a plot, today, he suggested that Agrizzi and the whistleblowers were in cahoots with the opposition Democratic Alliance, in an attempt to discredit the ANC before the country’s May elections, in which the party was re-elected, but with its lowest majority yet.Presumably on the basis of the Bosasa allegations, Cyril Ramaphosa dropped at least one implicated cabinet minister, Nomvula Mokonyane, a close Zuma associate who was allegedly at the heart of the Bosasa syndicate, and Watson’s primary beneficiary. Mokonyane has called the allegations untrue, and announced her intention to defend herself before the commission. Ramaphosa has also apologised for the error in judgment in having accepted funds from Watson, given that Bosasa was under investigation. Still, he now finds himself under investigation too, by an antagonistic public protector (a statutory ombudsman of sorts) who believes that he wilfully misled parliament, and might even be guilty of money-laundering through his campaign fundraising.The public protector’s name is Busisiwe Mkhwebane. So aggressively has she gone after Ramaphosa and his major anti-corruption ally, the state enterprises minister Pravin Gordhan, that many South Africans believe she is doing the bidding of the Zuma kleptocrats swept from office by Ramaphosa – allegations that Mkhwebane says are “unfair” and “without basis”. Meanwhile, Zuma will appear before Zondo next week, against his will. In a letter leaked to the press, his lawyer has slammed the commission as seeking its “own truth” and wishing “to deliver our client … for public display and in order to ambush and humiliate him”.The allegations against Bosasa and Gavin Watson are by no means the only ones that have been made before Zondo, or even the most damning, in terms of “state capture”. But they are the most detailed. The way the South African authorities act on them will be a litmus test of whether they are, finally, freed from their “capture” during the dark second act – the Zuma years – of the South African democracy.• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d27f8948ea9265fb235bf8568db66bf50bd41107/0_0_3500_2333/master/3500.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=623c3a9e9590a2a69ec8b4a4eefb6158 1760w","title":"fossil of 99m year old bird with unusually long toes found","story":"Ancient bird’s foot is so distinctive palaeontologists declare it a new speciesThe fossilised remains of a bizarre, ancient bird that had middle toes longer than its lower legs have been found in a lump of amber from Myanmar.The elongated toe resembles those seen on lemurs and tree-climbing lizards, and suggests an unusual lifestyle for some of the earliest birds that lived alongside the dinosaurs, researchers said.“We have the leg of a little 99-million-year-old bird, preserved in amber, that shows a foot morphology unlike any known previously,” said Jingmai O’Connor, a vertebrate palaeontologist and co-author of the study at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.The foot was so distinctive that O’Connor and her team declared the bird, which was probably about the size of a sparrow, a new species, naming it Elektorornis chenguangi. The first part of the name translates to “amber bird”. It is the first bird species to be recognised from amber.Scientists compared the bird to the only other known species that has such disproportionately long digits: the aye-aye, a type of lemur which uses its elongated fingers to pry larvae and insects out of tree trunks. The researchers believe that Elektorornis might have used its toes for similar purposes.The bird might have spent most of its time in trees rather than in water or on the ground, the team speculate, developing its longer toes to cling to branches more easily, as seen in tree-climbing lizards.Along with its unusually long toes, the bird is thought to have sported teeth, and claws on its wings, and it may havehad primitive feathers. It lived in a mangrove forest by the sea, alongside lizards, snakes and frogs.The bird’s leg, discovered in a lump of amber from the Hukawng valley in Myanmar in 2014, was originally thought by traders to belong to a lizard, but O’Connor’s team swiftly identified it as an ancient bird’s foot.The study of the remains, published in the journal Current Biology, involved CT-scanning the amber to produce a 3D reconstruction of the foot. The model was compared with 20 other extinct bird species and 62 extant ones to fully establish its unique form.O’Connor said the fossil illustrates the “weird” lifestyle and anatomy of early birds, with the foot only the latest in a flurry of ancient animal remains found in Myanmar amber. Last year another team of scientists found the remains of an ancient proto-spider encased in amber. The spider had a tail twice as long as its body, which might have been swished from side to side to detect predators.The Chinese team now hope to study proteins and pigments in feathers found on the surface of the amber in the hope of better understanding how the bird was adapted to its environment, for example by using its feathers for camouflage.Daniel Field, a vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Cambridge, who was not involved in the study, said: “The bizarre proportions of the foot of Elektorornis emphasise how unpredictable the evolutionary history of birds has been.” He described the fossil as extremely well preserved. Without these fossils, “we would never have direct evidence of the fanciful deep evolutionary history of birds”, he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d84c95d76923fb1d7a6c647919a268d6873ec74/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c01ede9ec5323ae454f2c732781a04e","title":"poker ai wins multiplayer game for first time plurius texas holdem","story":"Pluribus wins 12-day session of Texas hold’em against some of the world’s best human players Rack up another win for the machines. An artificial intelligence called Pluribus has emerged victorious from a marathon 12-day poker session during which it played five human professionals at a time.Over 10,000 hands of no-limit Texas hold’em, the most popular form of the game, Pluribus won a virtual $48,000 (£38,000), beating five elite players who were selected each day from a pool who agreed to take on the program. All of the pros had previously won more than $1m playing the game.What counts as a beating for humanity ranks as a milestone for AI. No computer program has ever achieved superhuman performance against multiple poker players. A forerunner of Pluribus named Libratus made its name two years ago by trouncing top human players, but that program only played one-on-one.“It’s the first time AI has achieved superhuman performance in a multiplayer game,” said Tuomas Sandholm, who developed Pluribus with his PhD student Noam Brown at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. The ability to beat five players at a time in such a complex game of bluff and hidden information opened up new opportunities for AI to tackle real world problems, he said.According to Sandholm, the algorithm has potential in applications ranging from investment banking and negotiation strategies to wargaming and deciding how much US political candidates should spend advertising in various media in different states. In his laboratory, research is underway to use the algorithm in treatment plans that marshall precise populations of immune cells to fight specific diseases. The work was part-funded by the US Army Research Office.To master Texas hold’em Pluribus adopted some surprising, and distinctly non-human, strategies which have already been adopted by the professionals it played. It used wildly differing bet sizes, a strategy humans seem to find hard to do. And while humans usually avoid so-called “donk betting” – the practice of ending the first round of betting with a call and opening the next with a bet – Pluribus embraced the tactic. The received wisdom in poker is that donk betting is a weak move that rarely makes sense. Pluribus found otherwise. “I don’t understand it, but Pluribus understands it,” said Sandholm.In another computer v human challenge, the program beat two professionals, Darren Elias, who holds the record for the most World Poker Tour titles, and Chris Ferguson, who has won six World Series of Poker tournaments. The defeats came after each played 5,000 hands against five copies of the AI. “Pluribus is a very hard opponent to play against,” Ferguson said. “It’s really hard to pin him down on any kind of hand.”Artificial intelligence has already surpassed humans at games such as chess and Go, but in these games players can see the positions of all of the pieces there is no information that is hidden from them. In poker, players have only partial information and a cast of potentially bluffing opponents, making it a far tougher AI challenge.Pluribus learned poker by playing copies of itself. Starting from scratch, and playing randomly at first, the program steadily improved its performance. After eight days, it had devised a “blueprint strategy”, which it uses for the first round of betting. For subsequent rounds, Pluribus looks ahead to hone its strategy. It aims to be unpredictable to wrongfoot its opponents.The program runs on two Intel Haswell processors and uses a modest 128GB during play. In games against itself, Pluribus takes about 20 seconds to play a hand, making it twice as fast as a typical professional, the scientists write in the journal Science.Sean Ruane, one of the players who took on Pluribus, found the program a tough opponent. “In a game that will, more often than not, reward you when you exhibit mental discipline, focus, and consistency, and certainly punish you when you lack any of the three, competing for hours on end against an AI bot that obviously doesn’t have to worry about these shortcomings is a gruelling task.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b39a70e3c977fd8067a58284ca98674286256c8d/0_317_4758_2855/master/4758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00953feeb8225b3ab3ae68fc799c422d","title":"australia diamonds netball world cup 2019","story":"Australia are the top predators of the World Cup, having claimed 11 of 14 titles since 1963, but in Liverpool the hunters will find themselves in unfamiliar territory. The queens of the jungle can hear rustling in the reeds and it is the rest of the netball world planning an attack. After England last year beat the world champions in the dying moments of the Commonwealth Games final, the Australian Diamonds suddenly look beatable.There are other threats, too. South Africa are on an irresistible trajectory and the perennial bridesmaids Jamaica have arguably the world’s best bookends, with the goal shooter Jhaniele Fowler and the goalkeeper Shamera Sterling.Malawi beat the once mighty New Zealand at the Commonwealth Games but the Ferns have rebuilt under Noeline Taurua after missing a medal for the first time.All that sets up the 16-nation World Cup, which begins on Friday, as the most competitive in its 56-year history and one where, for the first time, an antipodean team are not the favourites.That mantle sits with the Tracey Neville-coached England, who not only won gold last April but also beat Australia in London in late January. England bring a mostly unchanged side into the tournament, featuring the leading lights Serena Guthrie, Geva Mentor, Helen Housby and Jo Harten.The Roses want to play down their favouritism, with the defender Eboni Usoro-Brown even trying the mental gymnastics-requiring “underdog favourites” line but England know they are expected to win and, more importantly, Australia know too.English netball has been building towards 2019 for years and it is widely suspected they “accidentally” won Commonwealth gold on the road to Liverpool, heaping yet more expectation on them. That is just fine with the Australia coach, Lisa Alexander.It is fair to say Alexander and her charges will not have forgotten the way England celebrated that three-goal win at the Copper Box, despite England being pushed all the way by what ended up being a second-string Australia.Given a swath of recent retirements, Alexander has a relatively inexperienced squad in Liverpool, with only 338 total caps: 489 fewer than England and 443 than New Zealand.While experience is not everything, in big tournaments it is often the cool-headed veterans who deliver victory, as was the case with the Australia defender Laura Geitz’s blinding performance in the 2015 World Cup final in Sydney.Only three players remain from that triumphant team: the shooters Caitlin Bassett and Caitlin Thwaites and the midcourter Paige Hadley. The rest of the Australia squad have never played in a World Cup.The nucleus of the team – the goalers Bassett, Thwaites and Steph Wood, the midcourter Liz Watson and the defenders Courtney Bruce, Jo Weston and April Brandley – were part of the losing Commonwealth team. The gamechanging shooter Gretel Tippett, the midcourters Jamie-Lee Price and Kelsey Browne and the young defender Sarah Klau have never played at a World Cup or Commonwealth Games.The fact her squad play in the best league in the world, Super Netball, gives them an edge, Alexander says. The Diamonds are happy as underdogs. “This group, because it is so different, they are hungry for the chase.”The former England international and UK Superleague coach Tamsin Greenway, who has applied to replace Neville as the England coach after the tournament, says it is the Roses’ time for World Cup gold.“When you win your first gold, the pressure lifts, so winning at the Commonwealths has put a relaxed feel into the England squad. They’ve done it. They’re quite calm,” Greenway says.For perhaps the first time Australia have nothing to lose – and that could be scary, she says. “They’re going to take it up to teams. I’m expecting a really good performance from the Aussie team. And remember, it’s not like they got smashed in that final, they lost by one goal … in the last second.”Housby, who shot that winning goal, and fellow shooter Harten, who play Super Netball, will be central to the Roses’ chances of success – and they have backup in the form of 36-year-old Rachel Dunn, who starred against Australia in January.The defenders Mentor and Layla Guscoth will strike fear into any attack line and through the midcourt, the captain, Serena Guthrie, and Chelsea Pittman will deliver pure grunt.Looking to other nations, New Zealand should not be discounted. With more than 100 caps each, Maria Folau, Casey Kopua, Laura Langman and Katrina Rore know how to win and, fuelled by the embarrassment at missing out on a medal at the Commonwealth Games, they will be no pushover.Many believe South Africa, coached by the Australian Norma Plummer, have a chance to win a medal for the first time in 25 years, on the back of many of their stars – including Karla Pretorius, Phumza Maweni, Lenize Potgieter and Bongi Msomi – playing in the best international leagues. “They are a genuine chance,” Greenway says. But it depends how the draw pans out. The Proteas are in the same group as world No 2 Jamaica.With more players than ever with top-flight experience, Jamaica could push for a podium finish in Liverpool. With Fowler at one end and Sterling at the other, it is the connection through the middle that will be the problem for the Sunny Girls.New Zealand have to get past Malawi, who are without the injured shooter Mwai Kumwenda, while Australia and England should not be troubled in the early rounds.Regardless of how the preliminary rounds play out, Australia and England should be in there when it matters. Will netball’s natural order be restored or will England roar from atop the podium, as the prey turn the tables and become the predators?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2f5c9e84f68f051cdbcdfc50052fcdcdcc199e2/0_276_4596_2758/master/4596.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=93c0eab3cbc95bb40d661c94894f55e2","title":"england australia cricket world cup semi final report","story":"England’s passage to the World Cup final was faintly ridiculous. Semi‑finals are supposed to be gritty affairs with runs dourly chiselled out in a desperate quest to get to Lord’s. In semi-finals you are supposed to win ugly. New Zealand showed the way at Old Trafford.Yet Eoin Morgan’s England took the alternative route to a final. They smashed Australia by eight wickets, chasing down a target of 224 with 17.5 overs to spare. When England were batting this game had the air of an exhibition match. Batsmen kept heaving deliveries from the mighty Mitchell Starc over the infield. Spinners were butchered into the stands. “We’ll get ’em in sixes” appeared to be the plan.England concluded after their defeat against Sri Lanka at Headingley they had been too passive at the top of the order when pursuing a modest total. This was not a charge that could be laid at their door at Edgbaston. They were minded not just to defeat the Australians but to humiliate them.Jason Roy sparkled once again, cracking a carefree 85 from 65 deliveries but it was the excellence of the bowlers earlier in the day that forged a victory that was surreal in its simplicity. Chris Woakes, who finished with three for 20 from eight overs, was justifiably the recipient of the man of the match award.Woakes’s first delivery, the first of the match after Aaron Finch had won the toss, was deceptive a gentle half‑volley was crunched through the covers for four by David Warner. This was the zenith of the Australian innings.Jofra Archer’s first delivery was also Finch’s first – and last. It was fast and straight and thudded into the left pad of the Australian captain. Kumar Dharmasena paused and then raised his finger Finch paused and sought a review, which was a futile exercise. In the next over Warner lofted a drive back over the head of the bowler. Maybe this prompted Woakes to extra effort. The next delivery bounced steeply Warner hung out his bat and edged a catch above the head of Jonny Bairstow at slip.As revealed in the , the Cricket World Cup final will be shown on free-to-air television now that England have qualified for the showpiece event against New Zealand. Eoin Morgan has backed the decision to show the Cricket World Cup final on free-to-air television, a story revealed in the . It\u0027s very cool, said England captain Eoin MOrgan. Particularly given the 2005 Ashes for me was the day cricket became cool – it was front and back page, everyone talking about it – that’s really good for the game. It’s great news it’s on free to air. The match will be screened from 9am on both Channel 4 and Sky Sports, which holds the\u0026nbsp UK broadcast rights. However, Channel 4 are also due to show the British Grand Prix on Sunday – the only live free-to-air slot for Formula One on British television this season – meaning cricket coverage will switch to More 4 for the duration of the race at Silverstone.Out came Peter Handscomb, just drafted from the Australia A squad, which has been tiptoeing anonymously around the English countryside. There was no hiding place here. He was close to being lbw to his first delivery, after which he loitered uncertainly before being bowled off the inside edge by Woakes. Australia were 14 for three and rocking.They rallied though it was a painful process, especially for Alex Carey, who had been promoted to No 5. Archer delivered a surprise bouncer, which clipped the bottom of Carey’s helmet, sending it off the batsman’s head and causing the fastener to penetrate his jaw. There was a long delay as the medics checked that Carey was not concussed before bandaging him up.Carey, once an Australian rules footballer, had no thoughts of withdrawing to the pavilion and he was soon battling away alongside Steve Smith, who was hellbent upon survival. Together they added 103 with increasing fluency. The threat of Woakes and Archer could not be matched by the other pacemen. Initially Adil Rashid was unable to trouble them much either. Then he intervened decisively.Carey attempted to clear the boundary on the leg-side, a very dangerous policy, even in the 21st century, when hitting into the wind. The ball sailed safely into the hands of the substitute fielder, James Vince, at deep mid-wicket, a simple catch but a good one in the circumstances.Now Rashid’s confidence soared. In the same over he propelled his googly though Marcus Stoinis was unaware of this and was lbw. As ever Glenn Maxwell flickered he hit Rashid for six over long-on and pulled him for four but before long Archer duped him. He tested Maxwell with a couple of bouncers, moderate ones that had too much elevation. Then Archer propelled his knuckle ball at a mere 80mph. Maxwell played too early and the ball plopped into the hands of Morgan at extra cover.Another googly from Rashid deceived Pat Cummins and then Jos Buttler, alert and athletic, contrived to run out Smith with a direct hit that travelled between the batsman’s legs before hitting the stumps. This was not going to be Australia’s day.England’s chase began conventionally enough. They had 50 after 10 overs and for a while Roy eyed up Starc and Cummins as if he was auditioning for a Test role. Then there was merry mayhem. Roy cracked Nathan Lyon’s first ball over long on for six. With his ship listing badly Finch tossed the ball to Smith, whereupon Roy hit him down the ground for three consecutive sixes. By now Roy and Bairstow had posted their fourth consecutive hundred partnership.Then Bairstow was lbw to Starc, a decision foolishly reviewed. Out came Joe Root, who hit his first three balls for four. The man on the sound system decided this was the time for Sweet Caroline and Hi Ho Silver Lining, though it was hard to see many compensations for the Australians. This was no longer a contest but a celebration.Next Roy was given out caught down the leg side by Dharmesena he asked for a review that England no longer possessed and was so stunned by the decision, a poor one, that he had to be persuaded to leave the field by the other umpire, Marais Erasmus, and Root. Very briefly England took stock. Morgan was peppered by short balls but before long the romp continued.By 5.15pm Australia had lost a World Cup semi-final for the first time. A new name will be etched upon the trophy on Sunday night."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c180612331672a1883bbc876b56d206650cd098d/0_172_4134_2480/master/4134.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=509dd5cd7d1bb58b3d012dcae3dc8586","title":"tour de france thomas makes statement but ciccone takes yellow","story":"Geraint Thomas reversed the narrative in the Tour de France, leading home the main contenders with a resurgent performance in the first summit finish of the 2019 race on the gravel road to La Planche des Belles Filles in the Vosges mountains. It was a show of strength that suggested the defence of the Welshman’s Tour title is very much alive.After overhauling a late attack from Julian Alaphilippe, the defending champion took back the time he had lost in Monday’s finish in Epernay and leapfrogged his Colombian team mate Egan Bernal in the overall standings by nine seconds to reassert himself in the Team Ineos hierarchy.Reminded that most pundits had tipped his 22-year-old team-mate to win the stage, Thomas replied: “I don’t listen to tips. I felt pretty good. I thought the steep climbs weren’t my cup of tea. I was expecting others – Nairo Quintana, Egan, Richie Porte, Adam Yates - would jump up there. It was a decent day in the end.“It is one of those climbs where you have to patient. When Alaphilippe went clear at 800 metres to go, I had the confidence to let him go and ride my own tempo and drive it all the way to the line.”Ahead of him an exhausted Giulio Ciccone, already a stage winner in this year’s Girod’Italia, took the maillot jaune from Alaphilippe’s shoulders to lead the Tourby six seconds, despite being beaten to the line for the stage win by breakaway companion Dylan Teuns of Belgium.Yet the final gruelling 500 metres proved very revealing. While Thomas, Alaphilippe and local hero Thibaut Pinot, widely seen this year as a potential winner rather than a mere contender, powered clear to the finish line, they also opened clear daylight on rivals such as Quintana, Jakob Fuglsang and Mikel Landa, who paid for his earlier attack halfway up the seven kilometre climb.Pinot, who lives about 15 kilometres from the climb, has already drawn high praise from Ineos sports director Nicolas Portal. “He and his team are impressive,” Portal said. “He’s areal contender for the overall win.”Further back, it was a bad day at the ‘Bench of the Beautiful Girls’ for several of Thomas and Bernal’s biggest rivals with riders such as Vincenzo Nibali, Porte, Fabio Aru and Romain Bardet, steadily losing touch with their hopes of a high placing in Paris.Bardet, who lost a minute to his rivals in Sunday’s team time trial, is now over two minutes behind Thomas. “I was not at the best level today which feels bitter,” the Frenchman said. “I’m still very motivated for this Tour but I have to try to understand what happened and why I was stuck like that.” However, Thomas is separated by only 35 seconds from Adam Yates, with Bernal, Pinot, Michael Woods, Rigoberto Uran, and Fuglsang all sandwiched between them. The fearsome climb, appearing for the fourth time and extended this year by a kilometre, has always been pivotal in past Tours, with the yellow jersey wearer after the stage going onto win in Paris in the 2012, 2014 and 2017 races through Bradley Wiggins,Vincenzo Nibali and Chris Froome respectively.Ciccone, winner of the King of the Mountains prize in the 2019, is however unlikely to continue that tradition. “The plan is the same,” the Italian said after the stage. “I’d like to hang onto the yellow jersey but I will work for Richie Porte.”The 160.5km stage over seven categorised climbs, including the Ballon d’Alsace, the first climb ever used in the Tour, was the first real rendezvous of this year’s race. “It was an interesting stage but I think everybody was a bit cautious because the last section with dirt was really hard and people wanted to go ‘full gas’ there,” Dan Martin said.“I lost a bit of time on the dirt section but I’m not worried. I think this Tour will be about who has the least bad day and today was definitely not a bad day for me.Friday’s seventh stage, the longest of the 2019 Tour, returns to flatter terrain as the peloton races from Belfort to Chalon-sur-Saone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfdb5385fa995f2f41f6e5d8b6a7e5d92c963f7d/290_40_3928_2356/master/3928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e62e614b44d06cf8c1398be68144290","title":"australia v england cricket world cup 2019 semi final live","story":"Chris Woakes, Jofra Archer and Jason Roy starred as England produced an awesome performance to thrash Australia by eight wickets with almost 18 overs to spare That’s it for our semi-final blog.

You have to feel for this Australian team, especially their admirable captain Aaron Finch. It’s no consolation, not to a country of serial winners, but they have come so far in the last year.England have travelled even further in the last four years. They are one win away from immortality.

Goodnight!“Sunday is the perfect chance for England to complete the circle, isn’t it?” says David Hopkins. “This New England ODI started in that terrific series against NZ and now they can top it off against them. If they do win, should Morgan’s first words to Kane be ‘thank you’?”I suppose Brendon McCullum, who was NZ captain back then, was Morgan’s biggest inspiration. It’s not just that series in 2015, either that astonishing shellacking at the World Cup a few months earlier was the moment Morgan decided enough was enough.“Evening Rob,” says Tom Hopkins. “Following on from Geoff’s commitment to get Marina Hyde on the OBO, can I request that if Rachel Gray’s date isn’t already the subject of Saturday’s Blind Date column that it be made so as a matter of urgency?”Andrew Strauss, who started all this with the appointment of Trevor Bayliss and the retention of Eoin Morgan, is chatting on Sky“I found myself getting quite emotional today. All we wanted four years ago was for England to go out and play a different style – we didn’t know where it would lead us but we thought that was England’s best chance of winning a World Cup. One more hurdle to overcome, and the only thing I’d ask of that team is: please play the same way. I know they will, and the pot of gold is there at the end of the rainbow.”“Hi Rob,” says Will. “So you want euphoric + OTT, how about this… Seriously, where do you think that performance stands in British sporting history? Taking the importance of the occasion and the quality of the opposition into account, it must be top 10? Scenes after the third consecutive six off Smith, the sound off the bat was ungodly.”I suppose it depends on how broadly you define sport.“I have a date with an Australian this evening,” says Rachel Gray. “It was of course going to be following our victory over India, then I saw it as an opportunity to appear gracious after a close defeat, but I am utterly unequipped to deal with this. How do I get through the evening without being totally insufferable?”You can’t, so the next best thing is to get so paggered on Victory Juice that you won’t remember being insufferable, which means you weren’t.Shane Warne is feeling funky He says that, if Bairstow is injured, England should open with Jos Buttler on Sunday. You know, he might be onto something. He usually is. He also wants Roy and Bairstow to open in the Test team, which, despite being an affront to 142 years of English opening batsmanship, is an increasingly persuasive idea.“Re: the earlier query about big-screen options for Sunday,” says David Hopkins. “I believe there’s a Fanzone with a big screen in Trafalgar Square. Good old Sadiq!” “I’m trying not to even think it, never mind type it, Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “There’s so much to admire about both teams heading to Lord’s on Sunday, but you know the three little words to which I refer...”“Despite England’s surge to ODI dominance over the past few years, this is the most excited I’ve ever been about England’s cricket prospects,” writes Bex. “Likeable players who dominate with their play, whatever happens in the final we’ve got the best damn side we could hope for. And WTF what that amazing Roy helicopter shot? Move aside, Maxwell, we have Royball now!”I’m still high on that innings. Nothing will ever top watching Kevin Pietersen playing one of his JFK innings, but Roy produced a helluvan homage.Jonny Bairstow may be doubtful for the final. He has a groin problem and will be assessed over the next couple of days. I suppose if he might be doubtful that means he is doubtful. “Haha, amazing!” says Richard. “Assuming we don’t have tickets for Lord’s \u0026amp fancy an experience, are there any official venues in London for enjoying the atmosphere on a big screen?”There will be, although I’m not sure where. You’re welcome!“I remember listening to the last World Cup semi-final on my Walkman in my A level Geography class,” says Nick Errington. “Mrs Sansom asked me if I could stop listening during the lesson. I explained it was either I listen quietly or leave the lesson. We agreed I could keep one ear on her and one on TMS. It was the right choice. Sometimes sport is more important. Just like today.”You must have been a very naughty boy – that game was on a Sunday. (I jest you meant the final, right?)“Is it too late,” says Adam Hirst, “to change the final venue to Edgbaston?” Anyone out there? We’ll keep the blog going for a while, so feel free to email euphoric thoughts.Jeez, England were good today. They are such merciless front-runners. “From ball two of the game,” says Joe Rooy on Sky, “we were outstanding.” That was their best display of the World Cup, by a mile, and you could argue it’s the finest performance in their ODI history. I’m probably getting carried away, but what the hell.Jofra Archer is being interviewed on Sky“I feel bad about Alex Carey. He’s coming to Sussex in a few weeks, so we’ll have something to talk about! It stopped swinging pretty early so I just went to the cross- and quarter-seam balls to get something off the wicket. It nipped more than it swung. Today was the best wicket to bowl a knuckle ball on I’ve never had that much reaction off the pitch, ever. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I’d be playing in a World Cup final.”Channel 4 has signed a deal to show the World Cup final live on free-to-air television, with the broadcaster showing Sky’s coverage from 9am onwards.However, because Channel 4 is already planning to show the Formula 1 British Grand Prix, the cricket coverage will shift to More4 from 1.15pm onwards - meaning most of the match will be tucked away on the more obscure channel.“I’d like to thank the fans – we’ve had unbelievable support. Edgbaston has always been very kind to us, but our support today has been exemplary. We took a lot of confidence from the last two group games. We set the tone from ball one, and when we got on top we made Australia pay a little bit.“Jason and Jonny are quite imposing when they get themselves in. Personally I think they’re in the form of their life. They set the tone for how we want to play and that’s important. “It’s a huge opportunity for us on Sunday. Everybody in that changing-room should take a huge amount of credit for what we’ve achieved in the last four years. Making the most of the opportunity on Sunday would be fantastic, but getting there alone is awesome.”“We were totally outplayed today. The way they set the tone with the ball in the first 10 overs was a huge part in the game. They bowled a great length, hitting the stumps a lot. Still a lot of positives to take out of the World Cup campaign from our point of view. We’ve come a long way from where we were this time last year in England.What a staggering turnaround we have witnessed from England’s ODI side. No, not the last four years I’m talking about the last two weeks. After they were hammered by Australia at Lord’s they were facing a career-defining humiliation since then they have beaten their three biggest rivals through performances of ever-increasing majesty. Chris Woakes is the Player of the Match It is now pouring down at Edgbaston. English TV department If you don’t have Sky, the highlights are on Channel 4 at 10pm tonight. And there were some serious highlights, especially when Jason Roy was batting. I hope his petulance doesn’t detract from an innings of Pietersenian genius and audacity.Here’s our match report from EdgbastonRoot ended with 49 from 46 balls, Morgan with 45 from 39. Mitchell Starc, who destroyed England at Lord’s along with Jason Behrendorff, ended with grisly figures of 9-0-70-1.Australia’s players all congratulate Root and Morgan. They usually take defeat with a lot of class, and today is no exception. There’s such a great atmosphere around Edgbaston. England owe South Africa a big thank you for this, because playing Australia at this ground was perfect. The crowd have been wonderful. We didn’t come up with a name for the ground, but it has certainly been England’s Gabbatoir today. 32.1 overs: England 226-2 (Root 49, Morgan 45) Eoin Morgan clouts Behrendorff down the ground for four to complete a glorious victory. England will play New Zealand in the World Cup final at Lord’s on Sunday!32nd over: England 222-2 (Root 49, Morgan 41) Glenn Maxwell, a proud fielder to the last, takes the game into the 33rd over with a spectacular stop at backward point.  “Hi Rob,” says Anil Haji. “Sitting at my desk reading the OBO with a smile on my face, feeling calm and positive about the final we’re going to be in. What’s wrong with this picture? If I’d tried this back in the 90s, I’d have been laughed out of the England Cricket Supporters’ Union (Pray For Rain branch).”31st over: England 216-2 (Root 44, Morgan 40) Root swats Behrendorff through midwicket for four more. I wondered about England’s ability to come from behind within a game they haven’t had to do so, unless you count when Australia were 4-0 after one ball. It’s been an awesome performance, a surgical dismantling of a superb Australian side.“I’m convinced,” says Damo, “that the umpire forgot England had used their review and took the safe (bottled it) option.”I think you might be right. Roy had certainly forgotten he signalled for a review before misplacing his rag.30th over: England 210-2 (Root 39, Morgan 40) Morgan batters Lyon to the cover boundary to take England past 200, and then Root reverse sweeps cheekily for four more. This is a pasting for the ages. Lyon, a potential matchwinner, has figures of 5-0-49-0.“So here we are,” whispers Harkarn Sumal. “Polishing off our drinks, undressing each other with our eyes the deal is sealed. We’re in the ClooneyLopez ‘Out of Sight’ zone, aren’t we? Grab your coat, Thomas Lord. You’ve pulled. See you Sunday.”29th over: England 197-2 (Root 33, Morgan 33) A brilliant slower bounce from Behrendorff hoodwinks Morgan, who waits and waits and waits and still misses his attempted pull stroke. A maiden. It’s only bloody time for a Powerade Hydration Break.“Afternoon Rob,” says Simon McMahon. “Just back from my morning walk. Don’t tell me, Australia made 350, and England are 120-5 after 25 overs in reply, right?”28th over: England 197-2 (Root 33, Morgan 33) Morgan gets down on one knee to drag Lyon round the corner for four, and makes room to bash the next delivery to the cover boundary. He has gone straight from first gear to fifth six from his first 12 balls, 27 from the next 16.“Required run rate less than two an over,” says Siraj Khan, who incidentally predicted a New Zealand victory over England at Lord’s before the semi-finals. “This can change radically if Steve Smith brings himself on.”27th over: England 186-2 (Root 32, Morgan 23) A lucky escape for Morgan, who mistimes a drive off Behrendorff’s slower ball. It teases Finch at mid-off before dropping just out of reach. Morgan is keen to get this done, and later in the over he pulls witheringly behind square for four. This has been a savage performance from England. Easy to get carried away, but given the moment (given the batsman, etc), I doubt there has been a better performance in their one-day history.“Could Umpire Dharmasena have sent his own decision to DRS with a soft ‘Out’ signal?” asks Rob Mildren.No, he’s not allowed to do that. The umpires can refer a few things – run-outs, stumpings, low catches – but they can’t go upstairs to see whether the ball has been edged unless one of the teams review.26th over: England 178-2 (Root 31, Morgan 16) Lyon returns to the attack and is reverse swept jauntily over backward point for four by Morgan.“I think the comparison of Roy to Pietersen is an unfair one,” says Chris Parker. “He’s much better than that.”Are you sure? Kevin Pietersen is, by some distance, the biggest genius I’ve had the privilege to watch play for England. (Just my opinion, etc.)25th over: England 171-2 (Root 30, Morgan 10) This is Starc’s eighth over. Root, who has quietly played a lovely little innings, flicks a low full toss to fine leg for four. He has 30 from 29 balls, and England need 53 from 25 overs.“It wasn’t ENGLAND’S fault, Rob (over 21),” says Tom Adam. “It was Bairstow’s fault – it was a ridiculous review since the only way he wasn’t out was if he’d hit it and he should have known he hadn’t. Bairstow has real form for this – he’s the Broad of batting reviews, but Broad’s manageable since he has to consult the committee of keeper and skipper. Bairstow has the power to do it himself. We should give a standing instruction to the umpires that no Bairstow signal for a review counts unless he gets the non-striker to sign it off in duplicate.”True, but there is a culture of indulgent, almost petulant reviews. I also think Roy told him to review, though I couldn’t be sure as they chucked me out of the WhatsApp group when they realised I wasn’t actually Zafar Ansari. 24th over: England 166-2 (Root 25, Morgan 10) Australia are bombing Morgan, who grits his teeth and takes one on the glove from Cummins. He is struggling with the short ball when Australia get their line right there have been a few poorly directed deliveries as well. When Cummins tries to sucker him with a fuller delivery, Morgan drives confidently over mid-off for four. Lovely shot. “What are the chances Roy will miss the final?” says Dave Brown. “He really threw his toys out the pram when given out. Is that more than just a fine?”I haven’t swotted up on the Code of Conduct in the last few decades, but I suspect it’s very unlikely. Although he was out of order, I have plenty of sympathy in the circumstances. He was playing the innings of his life, he was palpably not out, and Dharmasena’s shaky raise of the finger suggested he might have responded to the vigour of Australia’s appeal. 23rd over: England 158-2 (Root 23, Morgan 5) With Starc bowling to Morgan, Finch has placed himself in a catching position ... at long stop. Imaginary CricViz stats show his field registers 9.9 on the funkfieldometer. Starc does bounce Morgan, but it’s a bit too wide and Morgan is able to slap it over point for a one-bounce four.“Judging by the unbridled optimism of over 19,” says Ian Copestake, “I think the OBO has already been taken over by Marina Hyde.”There’s some light rain at Edgbaston, and the groundstaff are poised. England are 75 or so runs ahead on DLS.22nd over: England 153-2 (Root 22, Morgan 1) This is Australia’s last, last, last chance, which is why their best bowlers are on. If Cummins or Starc can bounce Morgan out, we might just have Mohali: The Sequel. With the required rate below three an over, Morgan is able to ignore a series of short balls. When Cummins gets his line a bit tighter, Morgan gloves the ball awkwardly at his feet. That was a beautiful delivery.21st over: England 151-2 (Root 21, Morgan 0) Thanks Geoff. While Geoff was handing over the baton, Mitchell Starc bowled six balls to Joe Root, off which four runs were scored. Now, Jason Roy. It was an unjust end to a stunning innings, but it’s England’s fault for an indulgent review earlier in the innings. They’ve done that a few times in the tournament. That innings, though. It touched the parts Kevin Pietersen used to reach, and there are few higher compliments, if any."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/429f9fbf3aaffc97b1b326bc0ee1ca0c3cab84ed/0_811_5266_3160/master/5266.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49e8e76d78b6343c7932cc46be71f478","title":"send tip campsites uk europe accessible by public transport","story":"Tell us about a great campsite in Europe, including the UK, you can reach without a carYou may have gone with the whole family to a brilliant site on a bus route or close to a railway station, or arrived at a major terminus in Europe and boarded a tram to a municipal camping ground.Of course, it’s not only the mode of transport and convenience of the location that’s important the quality of the campsite matters, too, so tell us about its setting, facilities and cafes.Send tips from all parts of the UK and Europe, including transport details, exact locations, websites and prices.Send us your tips by filling in the form below, with as much detail as you can in around 100 words.

The video and open letter from CEO Pieter Elbers asks: “Do you always have to meet face-to-face?” and “Could you take the train instead?”The campaign aims to encourage travellers and the aviation industry to consider the environmental impact of flying. It describes the “shared responsibility” of travellers and airlines to “fly more responsibly”, and says those in the industry need to “create a sustainable future for aviation”.The KLM campaign, which marks the airline’s 100th anniversary, calls on passengers to consider train travel for shorter distances and to replace face-to-face meetings with video calls. It also suggests packing lightly to reduce baggage weight so that planes uses less fuel, and to consider offsetting CO2 emissions. The airline’s carbon-offset programme (CO2zero) uses passenger contributions for reforestation projects, including a new tropical forest in Panama.However, critics have suggested that instead of asking the public to be aware of their actions, KLM, and other airlines, need to be considering solutions that lie with the industry itself. Justin Francis, founder of Responsible Travel, has called carbon-offsetting a “a dangerous distraction” from reducing emissions.“Voluntary initiatives by customers are not enough the cost of flying must increase … Responsible Travel advocates a Green Flying Duty, with the proceeds ringfenced for research and development into decarbonised aviation,” said Francis. “Carbon offsets are no substitute for carbon reduction. At the same time as telling customers to think about flying less, KLM will be telling its investors about its future growth.”The climate crisis has led France to announce the introduction of an eco-tax on tickets for all flights leaving the country. The new tax will range from €1.50 for short-haul and up to €18 for long-haul in business class. At a press conference, transport minister Élisabeth Borne, said that €180m is expected to be raised annually from 2020, which will help finance daily transport in France, notably rail.KLM has stated it is against this type of national CO2 aviation tax, because it believes Dutch passengers would travel by car to neighbouring countries, and continue to fly from there. On the company’s website, it says: “A global approach makes more sense. If the tax is implemented, we believe that it should be invested in sustainability of the aviation industry. National taxes will just go into the national coffers and won’t do anything to combat climate change.”The airline also said it would not stop promoting air travel: “We are stepping up … progress towards a sustainable future but we are a company that needs to make a profit to survive and to continue to invest in sustainable solutions. We want to still be around when we have succeeded in our efforts to make aviation sustainable.”The International Air Transport Association is backing the KLM campaign. Rafael Schvartzman, IATA’s vice-president for Europe, said: “We support it in the sense you do have a choice. In certain cases you could use the alternative.” But, he added: “The UK is an island. If you want to trade globally, you will have to count on aviation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4429d4ee72195db7768618195122343c4e1ccad/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e016035aa61823b77940edede5d011ce","title":"film stars on tv meryl streep big little lies george clooney catch 22","story":"Hollywood stars used to turn their noses up at television, but now Meryl Streep and George Clooney are stealing the show in your living room. Who might join them next?There have been plenty of surprises concerning Meryl Streep joining Big Little Lies. First, there was the Streep Scream, an earth-shattering howl that launched 1,000 memes. Second, there has been her performance as a whole: sometimes Deirdre Barlow channelling Willy Wonka sometimes a less considered Mrs Doubtfire. Yet for many watchers, the main surprise remains that we’re seeing Streep on TV at all.With her three Oscars, Streep is the queen of Hollywood’s old guard, the kind of film icon who at one time would never have done telly. She did appear in HBO’s Angels in America, but that was hardly normal TV – more theatre looking down its nose at a camera. Her appearance in Big Little Lies, a big, silly, schlocky TV series, signifies something else. Here’s a film legend accepting that, in order to stay big, the pictures have to get a little smaller.Streep’s not alone. George Clooney, who fought so hard to shrug off his role as hunky Dr Ross in ER, is back on TV in Catch-22. Sean Penn, has already starred in one series, astronaut drama The First, and will soon star in another, American Lion. Julianne Moore will head up Lisey’s Story, produced by Apple TV, hot on the heels of Julia Roberts in Amazon’s Homecoming, and Amy Adams tackling HBO’s Sharp Objects last year.It’s no surprise that movie stars are now doffing their caps to the growing cultural and financial might of TV and its associated streaming services. With Hollywood seeming ever staler, patriarchal and stuck in the same formats, TV is leading the way in writing and representation. It wasn’t exactly an abasement when Thandie Newton tackled Westworld and Line of Duty, and no one thought their auras were tarnished when Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson tried True Detective. None of this has been a sudden collapse of the defences, more a crumbling after a long siege. It’s likely Streep is appearing in Big Little Lies because season one starred Nicole Kidman, Laura Dern and Reese Witherspoon, who also produced the show. The fact that Hollywood has long struggled to provide decent roles for women over 40 has tipped many towards a medium that will engage with its large female audience.“All these talented women playing wives and girlfriends, I just had enough,” said Witherspoon in 2017. If this didn’t necessarily apply to the very top tier, it is the ecosystem above which they had been hovering anxiously. Kidman’s much-vaunted career renaissance over the last few years is, in part, due to her realising she could get even better opportunities when not working in just one medium.What’s more, the success of Big Little Lies is a reminder of the collapse of a certain type of similar mid-budget film, the “classy” drama on which many of these A-listers have built their reputations. There is a strong sense that today’s movies cater to the either blockbuster crowd – the Avengers, Pokémon – or the arthouse. Roberts, for instance, bagged her Oscar in 2001 for Steven Soderbergh’s Erin Brockovich, but would it be a film today? Surely it would be a prestigious five-parter on Netflix.It is worth bearing in mind, though, that Roberts won’t reappear in Homecoming, and the True Detective cast changes every season – nothing is more ageing, after all, than doing the same role season after season. Other, younger film stars, such as Jennifer Lawrence, are holding back from TV, too, which is strange when you consider how bumpy her recent movie career has been. Indeed, it’s tempting to think that something like her recent Red Sparrow would be much more at home on the Netflix navigation bar. Sitting next to Renée Zellweger’s WhatIf, it could even have looked reasonably sane.Right now, a one-off TV appearance gives you zeitgeist cachet – and a younger audience. TV is where “the conversation” is and you’d have to be pretty hidebound, or rich, not to care about staying relevant. Streep’s scream could be turned into memes and gifs in minutes. Would the same scream, in a cinema, create that cultural moment?Yet some stars are still resolutely holding out, among them Brad Pitt, Tom Hanks and Johnny Depp. The most glaring absentee, though, is Tom Cruise. The big daddy of Tinseltown sticks to the big screen and his Top Gun and Mission Impossible reboots. Is the small screen too small for Cruise? Given that his stardom has been worked at as assiduously as his acting, perhaps he cannot countenance being shrunk by these newer media (although younger fans are watching his movies on mobile phones). Pitt has helped produce some prestige telly (executive producer on The OA and Barry Jenkins’s forthcoming series The Underground Railroad) but hasn’t appeared on TV yet, unless you count his recurring small turn as a weatherman on his favourite comedy, The Jim Jefferies Show. This is a very old-school approach to television, treating it like a place to lark about. In 2019, to make only a cameo looks patronising. What will lure Pitt in? Surely something soon. He’s probably at a table at the Chateau Marmont right now, pondering a witty, woke six-parter on Hulu that would bump up his credibility with the kids. And if he needs a co-star, Liam Neeson doesn’t seem to be doing any telly, either."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f31bdd13dd322ce39932619e2a43c48c0edbe21/0_328_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d0967c483458f7eb040c0a1449efc5f","title":"kamala harris 2020 campaign debate","story":"Within 24 hours of the debate, her team raised more than $2m in online donations, and she moved up in the pollsKamala Harris is charming Iowa. She has more than doubled her campaign staff in New Hampshire and South Carolina. She enthused a crowd of black women at the Essence Festival with a multibillion-dollar plan to invest in black homeownership that matched concrete economic solutions with a fierce promise to right past wrongs.It is the jolt of energy that Harris’ campaign needed after months of struggling to stand out in the polls.Harris’ performance on 27 June, in the first round of debates of the 2020 presidential race, was a much-needed win. Harris walked on stage ranked fifth in the most crowded Democratic race in history. She left basking in attention, having metaphorically kneecapped the frontrunner.Within 24 hours, her team raised more than $2m in online donations, from 63,277 people – more than half of whom were donating for the first time. In the days that followed, polls put her among the group of top candidates in the race.With more than a year to the Democratic National Convention and 481 days until the 2020 presidential election, it’s still anybody’s game. Harris’ debate performance didn’t win her a domineering spot in the polls. It didn’t drown out the criticism she’s gone back and forth on key policy ideas. It didn’t obfuscate some of her controversial decisions as a California prosecutor. But she’s back in the race.Six months ago, for her campaign launch announcement in Oakland, 20,000 people swarmed downtown chanting, “Ka-ma-la! Ka-ma-la!” Local police estimated that Harris drew a crowd larger than Barack Obama did when he announced his run for president in Illinois in 2007.Harris spoke of her upbringing as a child of Indian and Jamaican parents in California, and she raised the mantle of her experience: her steady climb from career prosecutor to district attorney of San Francisco, to attorney general of California and becoming one of the state’s senators.She promised to prosecute the case against Donald Trump and fight for the one client she has fought for her entire life: the people. In her hometown of Oakland, deep in the heart of the self-fashioned resistance state, her message hit its target.“When she announced, it was life-changing,” said Kasie Barnes, a lifelong Oakland resident and mother of four. “I’ve always been familiar with her, I’ve always been proud of her successes, proud of her fight, proud of her voice. Because her voice is my voice and now that I have children, her voice is their voice.”Harris had a profile that spoke to the Democratic party’s rapidly changing base: she was a woman with a erse background, and unapologetically so. She was a trailblazer: the first woman of color to be elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California. She stood for all the things that the man in the White House did not, and against all the things that he did.She raised a jaw-dropping $1.5m in her first day. But as more and more people jumped into the race, the sheer volume of candidates began to water down the excitement that came with her launch.Until the end of June, even in her populous home state, Harris consistently polled behind the former vice-president Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders. A UC Berkeley poll had her at fourth in California in mid June, behind Senator Elizabeth Warren. Nationwide, Quinnipiac University and Politico had her polling at fifth, after Warren or the South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg.Warren had elbowed her way into the spotlight with her “I have a plan for that” attitude. Buttigieg was on magazine covers after clips of him speaking in Norwegian went viral. Yet six months into the campaign, Harris was fielding questions about whether she’d want to be Biden’s running mate.“There’s nothing Harris has done wrong. It’s just that she’s one of many,” David Latterman, a San Francisco-based political consultant, said in early June. “She’s up against heavyweights. Her whole career was in California. She’s well-known in California, but outside of California, she’s only just begun to make a name for herself.“Campaigns are not typically won in the spring of the off year” one Harris adviser told the . He pointed out that even though she trailed behind Biden and Sanders, she remained in the top five in a race of more than two dozen. “We have been putting the infrastructure in place for a push in the latter half of the year,” he said.To friends and supporters, Harris’ argued she has had her back against the wall before.At a gala celebrating the Sun-Reporter, San Francisco’s black community newspaper, around that time – an event where most attendees had known each other for decades greeted each other with full-hearted hugs encompassing the entire body, and proudly donned Kamala pins – Harris began her speech: “When I pulled those papers in November of 2002 to run for district attorney of San Francisco, there were many, many, friends and those who were not friends, that said it cannot be done, no one like you has done this before, it will be difficult, it will be hard work, you should wait your turn.”The anecdote centered on praising Amelia Ashley-Ward, the publisher of the Sun-Reporter, but the message behind it was clear: We’ve polled third, or even last, before. And look how that turned out.“In her 2010 campaign for attorney general, in the primary, I was told personally, by very influential electeds, that they did not think she could win,” said Brian Brokaw, a Sacramento-based Democratic consultant who managed Harris’ campaign during her 2010 run for California attorney general. “She proved everybody wrong.”“She thrives when her back is against the wall,” Brokaw added. “It’s like fuel for her.”Throughout the first six months of the campaign, Harris’ supporters had maintained: wait for the debates.She’ll take command of the stage in the same way she stole the spotlight while questioning Trump appointees, they promised. She’ll display that keep-them-on-their-toes moxie that kept everyone listening on their toes.“When those debates come, she is going to kill it,” her longtime friend Amelia Ashley-Ward said in May.At the 27 June Democratic debate, Harris brought on the fire even before the first commercial break. The stage had devolved into a chaos of candidates shouting at each other when Harris entered the fray: “America does not want to witness a food fight, they want to know how we’re going to put food on their table.”“She was prosecuting,” Latterman said. “Of course the line was preplanned, but it was very well-played because she was literally standing between two men yelling at each other, right over her face.”And then Harris went for the jugular. “As the only black person on this stage, I would like to speak on the issue of race,” she said, before turning her attention to Biden.“I do not believe you are a racist,” she continued, and then took him to task for his relationship with segregationist senators and his record of not supporting desegregation bussing efforts that directly benefited children like Harris.“There was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bussed to school every day,” Harris said to Biden. “That little girl was me.”Within hours of that line, her website was selling T-shirts with the face of “that little girl” splashed on the front.Harris’ questions and interjections had been among her biggest strengths in her three years in the Senate. Her exchanges with the the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh over the Russia investigation and abortion rights led to memes of her skeptical face circulating around social media. Video of the 1 May Senate judiciary committee hearing in which she flusters attorney general William Barr over the Mueller report has notched millions of views.“Every time she has one of those judiciary committee moments, her social media and her donations spike,” said Dan Schnur, a professor of political communications at UC Berkeley. “She’s a very talented prosecutor, and a very tough questioner, and Democratic primary voters are going to cheer whenever they see someone beating up on a Trump appointee.”The context behind the cheers is clear: if this is what she can do to a Trump appointee, what could she do to Trump himself? And, for many Democratic voters, kicking Donald Trump out of the White House is ultimately what the election is about.“She is someone whose toughness can’t ever be questioned,” Brokaw said. “People who are supporting her know she would not shy away from a fight against Trump, and I think a lot of people are picturing the two of them on a debate stage together.”At a Harris town hall viewing party in Rancho Cordova, California, earlier this year, the question of which candidate was most likely to beat Trump was on everyone’s mind.“She’s great in public hearings,” said Etta, a retired singer and legal assistant who asked to be identified only by her first name, over iced tea and brownies. “Trump will not be able to cut her in pieces. There’s no way.”In Oakland, the Harris town hall viewing parties fill to capacity within hours. But in the small, conservative town in central California, the five attendees, all but one of them of retirement age, were excited they had found other “people who are interested in Kamala.”“She is unflappable when she’s speaking,” added Barbara. “That’s something that we really need. I always trust her that she’s going to say the right thing, she’s going to lay it out clearly, and not stumble on her words.The question now is if the anticipation of a Trump v Harris showdown will be enough to ease some of the criticism and overcome some of the challenges the California senator has faced in recent months.She has a natural constituency among women of color, a crucial constituent in the Democratic race to the White House, but she needs to get better at telling her personal story to those voters, said Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People. Her attack at the debate and the Essence Conference was a start – “Talking about her own experiences was part of the most powerful part with her exchange with Biden,” Allison said – but she must do more.“It’s not just that because you’re a woman of color, you’re going to appeal. That’s not the case for Tulsi Gabbard, for example,” Allison said. “But if you’re a woman of color who can speak with vulnerability, authenticity and power, that will make you stand out.”In tapping into that vulnerability, however, her prosecutorial experience gets viewed through a different lens. In the age of Black Lives Matter and broadening support for criminal justice reform, someone who has worked within the system her entire career can’t exactly reinvent herself as someone now fighting against it. Harris describes herself as a “progressive prosecutor”, but has a track record endorsing policies now considered racist and ineffective as district attorney and attorney general. “Kamala Harris is a cop,” some of her critics on the left have argued, pointing at some of her decisions on issues including sex work, police reform, prosecutors’ misconduct, prisoners’ rights and truancy.Just last week, amid the celebrations over her debate performance, The Appeal, a not-for-profit media outlet focused on criminal justice reform, highlighted the wrongful conviction of Jamal Trulove under Harris’ tenure as district attorney. San Francisco ultimately agreed to pay Trulove $13.1m after a federal civil jury found that the police had coerced a witness into identifying him as the suspect. Trulove, an actor who is gaining recognition following his role in the film The Last Black Man in San Francisco, tweeted, “That Black man was me!” – a glib reference to one of Harris’ one-liners in the debate.“Every candidate’s record is going to be scrutinized in this race,” her campaign adviser shrugged. “This is not a walk in the park. This is the competition to be leader of the free world. Everybody’s record should be scrutinized.”Others have questioned Harris’ hesitancy to clarify her position on more isive policy questions in the first months of the campaign. After the CNN town hall in April, political pundits pilloried Harris for continually answering, “I think we should have that conversation.” They criticized her for taking too cautious a stance, for being too deliberate, too guarded.Even Etta, one of the women at the Rancho Cordova watch party, was quick to pipe in with a snarky aside. “Oh, cop-out answer!” she hollered, when Harris punted.Harris faced a similar criticism last week, when her answers on whether she’d support federally-mandated bussing appeared to change. Her team later explained that it was a question of nuance, not yes or no – she supported the federally-mandated bussing that allowed “that little girl” to go to elementary school in 1970, but understands that times are different now.She came out on the technical side of right in this fight, but dinged nonetheless. She was scathed even more for her position on eliminating private health insurance, an issue she had already walked back but raised her hand in favor of during the debate. She later had to clarify that she misinterpreted the question.“Where is she politically?,” asked Latterman, the San Francisco-based political consultant. “She seems to be moving to the left. More exposure is going to expose more of what her politics are, and I think to some extent, she’s still trying to figure that out on a national level.”Harris’ supporters in San Francisco argue that given the chance, she will beat Trump.After all, this is the woman who faced off with an incumbent district attorney from a storied San Francisco family, and won. This is the woman who remained steadfast for three weeks after the 2010 attorney general election while the state tallied up mail-in and provisional ballots, and won by a margin of 50,000 votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adec114e9a3ad1bfdb8da4c2c7bf54e0fc3c08be/0_79_3032_1819/master/3032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0098c2c08d0c16cb0eb413ad6255787b","title":"angela merkel sits anthems after latest shaking episode","story":"German chancellor reportedly requests change of protocol after third bout of tremblingAngela Merkel sat through the German and Danish national anthems during a ceremony welcoming Denmark’s prime minister to Berlin. The German chancellor reportedly requested the change in protocol a day after she was seen shaking in public for the third time in as many weeks.Merkel appeared calm as she and the new Danish leader, Mette Frederiksen, took seats on white upholstered chairs on the red carpet during military honours outside the chancellery in Berlin. The chancellor remained still throughout the hymns, moving only to smile and nod at her visitor.A report in the Bild newspaper suggested Merkel had asked for a change to the protocol in which the leaders would normally stand through the ceremony. A day earlier, Merkel was seen trembling while standing at the same location as she welcomed the Finnish prime minister, Antti Rinne.Afterwards, the chancellor, who intends to step down by 2021, said she was “doing fine” and indicated she believed the cause of the shaking bouts was at least partly psychological.The latest episode, which appeared to stop when Merkel moved, was thought to be less serious than previous bouts. The 64-year-old was seen moving uncontrollably during military honours for the visiting Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in blazing heat on 18 June.“I am going through a phase of processing the recent military honours with President Zelenskiy,” Merkel said on Wednesday. “This appears not to be quite finished yet, but I am making progress and will have to live with it for a while.”After the initial bout, she blamed dehydration, later claiming she recovered after a drink of water. But a week later she had a similar episode in more comfortable weather while appearing with the German president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the Bellevue Palace in Berlin.One German media report, citing government sources, suggested Merkel’s second shaking bout was triggered by the memory of the first. She was also seen shaking during military honours in humid conditions in Mexico City in 2017.Merkel’s decision to sit through the ceremony will further fuel speculation about whether the long-serving leader’s famously gruelling schedule – including frequent all-night marathon meetings – – has begun to take its toll on her health. Explanations floated in the German press range from dehydration to anxiety, overwork and stress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/520704d28944a1a46f861d2abe15fb7b341edcc5/0_74_3467_2081/master/3467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a5af60133f2d5e3a43ff1807fab94d8","title":"matteo salvinis party under investigation for alleged russian oil deal","story":"Inquiry to examine corruption claims over alleged plan to channel Russian oil funds to Salvini partyItalian prosecutors have begun an investigation after claims saying Matteo Salvini’s far-right party, the League, sought funds via a Russian oil deal.Prosecutors in Milan have opened an inquiry into possible charges of international corruption in the case. The inquiry follows an investigation by L’Espresso magazine (reported by the  in February) which alleged there was an arrangement by Russian representatives, close to Vladmir Putin’s government, to sell 3m tons of diesel fuel to an Italian oil company.The inquiry was launched by magistrates in February but its existence was announced only on Thursday.Milan’s chief prosecutor, Francesco Greco, told ANSA news agency: “We are carrying out investigations to understand if there are crimes or not.”According to L’Espresso, on 18 October 2018 a member of Salvini’s entourage, Gianluca Savoini, met two Italians and three Russians in Moscow’s hotel pol to discuss a deal that would ert profits to the League before the European electoral campaign in May.It alleged that such a deal would represent “a breach of Italian electoral law, which bans political parties from accepting large foreign donations’’.Reached by the  in February, Savoini, described as the League’s emissary in Moscow, in an email declined to comment on the “fake news”.The League has denied the reports in L’Espresso and Buzzfeed, and on Wednesday Salvini threatened legal action. “I have already sued for libel in the past, I’ll do it again today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,’’ he said.Although L’Espresso admitted it had no evidence that the deal was ever executed, the claims raised questions about the relationship between the Kremlin and the anti-immigrant party, which is in a coalition government with the anti-establishment Five Star Movement.Giovanni Tizian, a journalist from L’Espresso, said: “We have documented that the meeting between Savoini and the Russians at the pole hotel in Moscow is just the outcome of a series of meetings held in June and July 2018 where Savoini was pushing for a deal with the Russians.” Tizian, along with the investigative journalist Stefano Vergine, co-authored a book entitled The Black Book of the League.Opposition parties described the claims as worrying and urged immediate explanation. “Rubles from Russia to the League? Salvini has to immediately clarify to parliament,” said Nicola Zingaretti, the centre-left Democratic party’s leader."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab6c893f94df9d0fe317d208a94fc99eac6078ea/0_98_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70440b2c0138cb81abc89e2d956764c6","title":"saudi arabia planning to relax male guardianship laws","story":"Strict rules governing women’s lives could be changed according to Saudi newspaperSaudi Arabia could be planning to relax the country’s strict male ship laws to allow women to leave the country without needing permission from a male relative, according to reports.Travel restrictions for women over the age of 18 are due to be lifted this year, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, quoting Saudi officials familiar with the matter. The planned changes would also lift restrictions on international travel for men under the age of 21 without the consent of designated male family members.Potential reforms to travel rules for women were also mentioned in Saudi Arabia’s Okaz newspaper on Tuesday.Such a move would have a radical impact on life in the conservative kingdom, where human rights organisations say the male ship system makes women second-class citizens.Saudi women still need the permission of a male relative to make major life decisions, including marriage, orce and obtaining a passport. The system also makes it difficult for women to seek help for domestic and sexual violence issues or win child custody cases.The kingdom’s ship laws have been under renewed scrutiny this year after a series of young Saudi women fled the country seeking asylum. In January, 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Mutlaq al-Qunun made headlines after escaping alleged abuse at the hands of her family and barricading herself in a hotel room in Thailand. She was eventually given refugee status in Canada.The reported changes to travel rules are understood to be recommended by a government committee set up in 2017 to review the country’s often ad hoc implementation of ship laws.“There is no question that the leadership, the government and the people want to see this system changed,” a Saudi royal with knowledge of the planned changes told the Journal. “The current discussion is about how to make this happen as soon as possible without causing a stir.”The impetus to reform the travel rules had come “from the top”, another senior adviser said.The Saudi interior ministry, through which such changes would have to be implemented, did not immediately respond to the ’s request for comment.The reported lifting of travel restrictions was met with a mixture of optimism and caution by Saudi women’s rights activists and human rights organisations on Thursday.Bin Salman, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, has implemented sweeping social and economic reforms designed to wean the country off its dependence on oil revenue since he was appointed heir to the throne in 2017.A royal decree ended the kingdom’s long-standing ban on women driving in 2018 and women no longer need their ’s permission to get a job, enroll at university or undergo surgery.However, the move towards greater freedom for women has been accompanied by a crackdown on dozens of women’s rights activists, many of whom remain in prison where their families allege they have been tortured.“If confirmed, the news marks a small and long-overdue concession to domestic and international calls on the kingdom to improve its record on women’s rights,” said Taif al-Khudary, a legal officer at the Gulf-focused legal advocacy NGO MENA Rights Group. “If the Saudi authorities were truly committed to women’s rights they would release and drop all charges against the women activists, who have been persecuted precisely for advocating for the male ship system to be abolished. The report today must not be used as an excuse to ease international pressure on Saudi Arabia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/228a909806ae47acc2105e120e0feb782c8a9d2e/802_632_3721_2233/master/3721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c5b21f3e1fd95c093af0c0f4727ba170","title":"hong kongs lennon walls in pictures","story":"Hong Kongers have displayed a characteristically riotous embrace of political graffiti in the form of Post-it notes documenting their anger and hope, during their huge anti-government rallies.

Photograph: Michelle DevanePA WireThe Government has been soundly defeated on a vote on the Mercusor trade deal in the Dáil.The motion condemned the trade agreement, recently agreed between the EU and four South American countries, as “a bad deal for Ireland and for the planet” and mandated the Government to oppose the deal at the Council of Ministers in the future.It also demanded that the Government “consider this motion as binding on this and future governments” and said the Government must use “all legal and political means available to frustrate and thwart the deal”.It also said the Government should “nominate a suitably competent person to defend Ireland’s interests as the next EU Commissioner.”Current European Commissioner Phil Hogan - who the Government decided this week to nominate for another term - has been criticised for his support for the deal.On Wednesday, up to 1,000 beef farmers demonstrated against the deal outside Leinster House.The vote was postponed from Wednesday in line with the practice of holding most Dáil votes on a Thursday.Although the Government suffered a heavy defeat, it does not regard the vote as binding, and will not affect Government policy, which is to examine the details of the deal before forming a view on whether to oppose it.Tabling the motion on Wednesday, Sinn Féin TD Brian Stanley said his party “believes the EU-Mercosur trade deal is bad for Ireland, farmers and the environment. “We want the Government to stand up for Irish interests and reject this disastrous trade deal,” he said. “We cannot stand over a trade deal which undermines completely Ireland’s climate change targets and the Paris Agreement. We cannot support a deal which requires and facilitates the destruction of the Amazon rainforest. We cannot support a deal that sells out Irish beef farmers and accelerates a race to the bottom in the beef industry on beef quality and workers’ rights,” Mr Stanley said.BullockA large number of opposition TDs from all parties and independents spoke against the deal. However, Minister for Enterprise Heather Humphreys said that many TDs were “happy to jump on a bandwagon to score a cheap political point. “The truth, however, is that some of them would not know a bee from a bull’s foot or the difference between a bull and a bullock,” she said.Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed, who has also been an opponent of the deal and said the Government would seek to frustrate its intensions, said the motion was meaningless.“It will not make one iota of a difference legally as to whether a deal, which is not on the table now, ultimately becomes a reality. It is a meaningless vote,” he said.The Government says that the deal agreed two weeks ago must now be translated into a legal text, after which it will be voted on by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. It says it will use that period to influence the final text to protect the Irish beef industry. However, there is widespread opposition to the deal among the farming organisations and considerable unease among rural Fine Gael TDs. The Irish Farmer’s Association welcomed the outcome of the vote. IFA president Joe Healy said it sends a “very strong message” to the Government that Ireland must reject the deal.

Earlier this week at a private meeting, Mr Coveney accused Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt of having an “utterly disingenuous debate” on Brexit in their contest to become British prime minister.Mr Coveney described the contenders as “people who should know better”.On Thursday, he told the Dáil that “the commitment of the Government throughout the Brexit process to prevent a hard border remains the highest priority”.Mr Coveney said this summer, commentary would be dominated by Brexit and the build up to September and October and the challenges of dealing with a potential no-deal scenario.He said he would be available through the Dáil recess to brief opposition TDs or address any queries they might have to “ensure that unity of purpose created in this House around Brexit can be sustained and strengthened” in the difficult time ahead.Former Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams expressed concern that the Government’s action plan highlighted a risk the UK government might initiate a move to direct rule in Northern Ireland. He called for confirmation that the Government was “implacably opposed” to such a move and would use all international forums if the British attempted this.In replay, Minister of State for European Affairs Helen McEntee said that “we have always said - the Tánaiste, Taoiseach and myself as Minister - that that would not be something we would ever accept”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green corridor\u0026#39 to streamline tourism to ChernobylRobot defeats world\u0026#39s top poker players in breakthrough for Artificial IntelligenceGermany classifies Identitarian group as Right-wing extremistsHarvey Weinstein hires third legal team as \u0026#39dream team\u0026#39 of lawyers fade awayMissing Texan man eaten by his own dogsIntelligence sharing with the US will be harmed if UK uses Huawei in 5G network, says former head of  Homeland Security Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39ease\u0026#39 male ship law restricting women\u0026#39s travelRecord numbers struggle to see GP - and most can\u0026#39t see the one they want Gordon Ramsay’s new restaurant will be dark and dim as designer says it’s a restaurant not an Instagram photography studioSeven in ten students who get less than DDD at A-level graduate from university with top degrees, report findsTop French chef demands removal from \u0026#39incompetent\u0026#39 Michelin guide after it wrongly said he put cheddar in souffléComment: We can\u0026#39t succeed at Brexit without reigning in our chaotic Foreign OfficeTory leadership latest: Boris Johnson would win leadership contest by a landslide, poll showsSupermarkets accused of charging customers more for plastic free canned goods in multipacks Bentley unveils self-driving concept car that will tell if you\u0026#39re in a bad mood and feed youUnited Nations to launch probe into Philippine drugs warFacelifts make men seem more likeable and trustworthy, says studyBaby whales and their mothers whisper to evade predatorsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel seen shaking third time welcomes finnish pm","story":"Angela Merkel has insisted she is very well after she was seen shaking at a public occasion for the third time in recent weeks on Wednesday.The veteran Chancellor can be seen shaking at a ceremony to welcome the Finnish prime minister to Berlin in a short video clip circulating on social media.After shaking for a few seconds she gestures to Finnish leader Antti Rinne and then walks away without showing any signs of distress.Reuters has also reported that Mrs Merkel started to shake during the meeting in Berlin.Speaking to journalists afterwards, Mrs Merkel said: I feel very well, there is no need to worry. She added: I think me saying I am fine should be acceptable.Mrs Merkel held her arms during a shaking episode in Berlin last monthMrs Merkel has carried on with her scheduled appointments since the incident, and no official explanation has been offered.The German leader’s first shaking fit came on June 18 when she welcomed the Ukrainian president to Berlin.

He was detained in China for several weeks in 2016, and recalled being told to memorise answers that were later filmed in the presence of a dozen state security officers, with the lead interrogator directing retakes, asking him to change his phrasing, tone and posture.Another came from British private investigator Peter Humphrey, who said he was drugged, strapped to an iron chair, and locked in a cage while being filmed and forced to confess to crimes.In total, he was jailed in China for two years, along with his American wife.  Angela Gui, the daughter of abducted Swedish bookseller Gui Minhai, who now studies at the University of Cambridge, also filed complaints on behalf of her father’s forced confessions.He continues to be held by Chinese police after being kidnapped in 2015. A similar one was received from Lam Wing-kee, another kidnapped Hong Kong bookseller.The Ofcom investigation comes at a time when CGTN has invested heavily in the UK and abroad, boasting 10,000 employees and 70 bureaus around the world. CGTN’s new European broadcast centre is in West London’s Chiswick Park.A plethora of job ads have been posted recruiting journalists to fulfil the organisation’s aim “to provide objective, balanced, and impartial news and current affairs content, reporting the news from a Chinese perspective.”Activists have called for the Chinese state media outlet to be stripped from UK airwaves, saying it doesn’t report balanced stories. Chinese leaders themselves have before described CGTN and other state media outlets as the “eyes, ears, tongue and throat of the Communist Party.”“Ofcom is carrying out independent investigations into fairness and privacy complaints about programmes broadcast on CCTV News and CGTN,” the regulator said in a statement.“We’ve had no contact with CGTN or anyone connected with the broadcaster on these investigations, other than through our transparent, established procedures.”There’s no problem in hiring a former Ofcom board member or employee “in principle,” said Trevor Barnes, an independent broadcast compliance consultant, provided that person “has been on an appropriate period of ‘gardening leave’ after quitting Ofcom and does not impart any confidential information.”Ofcom has revoked only a few licenses in the regulator’s 16-year history.In 2012, Iranian state broadcaster PressTV, which was also accused of airing forced confessions, was stripped of its broadcast license after Ofcom found its practice of running editorial oversight from Tehran breached broadcasting license rules.Ofcom revoked a license for Iman FM in 2017 after the radio station broadcast hours of lecture by an alleged al-Qaeda cleric, finding it was not “fit and proper.”The regulator also revoked the license for Ausaf last year, an Urdu language channel, ahead of its UK launch, and has also taken adult pay channels off air.  Mr Pollard and CGTN didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green corridor\u0026#39 to streamline tourism to ChernobylRobot defeats world\u0026#39s top poker players in breakthrough for Artificial IntelligenceGermany classifies Identitarian group as Right-wing extremistsHarvey Weinstein hires third legal team as \u0026#39dream team\u0026#39 of lawyers fade awayMissing Texan man eaten by his own dogsIntelligence sharing with the US will be harmed if UK uses Huawei in 5G network, says former head of  Homeland Security Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39ease\u0026#39 male ship law restricting women\u0026#39s travelRecord numbers struggle to see GP -

There must be no tolerance for these extremists.”The UK has reportedly banned Identitarian leader in Austria Martin Sellner from ever entering the country citing a risk to public security.A picture taken on July 27, 2016 shows the local leader of the Identitarian Movement (IBOe) far right group, Martin Sellner speaking during a rally organised by IBOe in Vienna, AustriaAustrian police are currently investigating the 30 year old over suspected links to the terror attack on mosques in Christchurch that left 51 people dead.While the organisation is most prominent on mainland Europe they also have a branch in the UK and Ireland.German Green party parliamentary leader Konstantin von Notz welcomed the BfV’s decision, telling broadcaster ARD that the Identitarians play “a central role” in the increased propensity to violence of the far-Right.“The cooperation between the Identitarian movement and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), even in our parliament, is now a real problem for the AfD,” Mr von Notz continued.The populist AfD have publicly distanced themselves for the extremist group, but a newspaper revealed earlier this year that a leading Identitarian figure was working for them in the Bundestag.The move against the organisation comes on the same day that a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation found 52 percent of Germans see Islam as a threat to their country. Views on Islam were in stark contrast to those on other religions. Fewer than one in six respondents thought of Christianity, Judaism or Buddhism as a danger with at least two thirds seeing these religions as an enrichment for society.Around 13 percent of Germans also want to stop all Muslim migration to their country, the study showed.Although our study shows quite widespread scepticism of Islam, it is not necessarily synonymous with Islamophobia, study author Yasemin el-Menouar cautioned.Many people express reservations about Islam, but do not derive from this political demands or anti-democratic views.”“Evidently, many people currently see Islam more as a political ideology than a religion and therefore exclude it from religious tolerance.Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green corridor\u0026#39 to streamline tourism to ChernobylRobot defeats world\u0026#39s top poker players in breakthrough for Artificial IntelligenceHarvey Weinstein hires third legal team as \u0026#39dream team\u0026#39 of lawyers fade awayMissing Texan man eaten by his own dogsIntelligence sharing with the US will be harmed if UK uses Huawei in 5G network, says former head of  Homeland Security Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39ease\u0026#39 male ship law restricting women\u0026#39s travelRecord numbers struggle to see GP - and most can\u0026#39t see the one they want Gordon Ramsay’s new restaurant will be dark and dim as designer says it’s a restaurant not an Instagram photography studioSeven in ten students who get less than DDD at A-level graduate from university with top degrees, report findsTop French chef demands removal from \u0026#39incompetent\u0026#39 Michelin guide after it wrongly said he put cheddar in souffléComment: We can\u0026#39t succeed at Brexit without reigning in our chaotic Foreign OfficeTory leadership latest: Boris Johnson would win leadership contest by a landslide, poll showsSupermarkets accused of charging customers more for plastic free canned goods in multipacks Bentley unveils self-driving concept car that will tell if you\u0026#39re in a bad mood and feed youUnited Nations to launch probe into Philippine drugs warFacelifts make men seem more likeable and trustworthy, says studyBaby whales and their mothers whisper to evade predatorsComment: This time it\u0026#39s different – why anti-Semitism could finally sink LabourWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/04/04/TELEMMGLPICT000178641282_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"harvey weinstein hires third legal team dream team lawyers fade","story":"Harvey Weinstein, leaving the courthouse in ManhattanHarvey Weinstein was described as being “impossible to work with” by his legal team, it was claimed on Thursday, as the film producer was granted judicial approval to replace his lawyers once again - meaning he is now onto his third legal team with only two months to go until his trial.Weinstein, 67, appeared in court in Manhattan to ask Judge James Burke to approve his new legal team, following the departure in January of high-profile lawyer Ben Brafman, and the exit this month of Florida defence lawyer Jose Baez and Harvard University law professor Ronald Sullivan.Mr Sullivan, the first African American faculty dean of a Harvard undergraduate house, found out in mid May that his contract at Winthrop House would not be extended after his term ended on June 30, as the university bowed to months of pressure from students.At the end of May he announced his intention to step down from the Weinstein case, saying it conflicted with his teaching schedule.Harvey Weinstein with his former lawyer Ben Brafman, who quit the case in JanuaryMr Baez told Judge Burke in a letter last month that his relationship with Weinstein had broken down.“Mr Weinstein has engaged in behavior that makes this representation unreasonably difficult to carry out effectively and has insisted upon taking actions with which I have fundamental disagreements,” he wrote.Adam Citron, former assistant district attorney in Westchester County and now Senior Counsel at Davidoff Hutcher \u0026amp Citron LLP, said Weinstein was “obviously a difficult person to deal with”.“He’s used to being in control, and is ignoring the advice of his counsel,” he told The .“It’s actually quite common to come across this when dealing with successful, A-type people. A lot of our job is client management.”Mr Citron said Weinstein’s strategy of winning the battle in the court of public opinion – something Mr Brafman in particular disagreed with – was at risk of backfiring.“I think this is damaging to him,” he said. “It doesn’t help his public persona if he’s firing lawyer after lawyer.”Harvey Weinstein was charged in May 2018Another source told The Daily Beast website: “He thinks he’s making a movie. He’s just trying to put together the perfect cast and it’s not working. It’s not a movie. He is impossible to work with.”Jeremy Saland, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office told the site that having a “constant revolving door” of lawyers isn’t good for Weinstein’s case.“Every time you change counsel, you run the risk that something will be missed or misinterpreted,” he said.“That never comes out to the benefit of the accused.“The lack of continuity demonstrates that he may be a difficult client, he’s unwilling to heed the advice and strategy of his counsel, or there’s financial troubles. It seems to me it’s one or a combination of those issues.”Weinstein is now represented by two new Chicago-based lawyers, Donna Rotunno and Damon Cheronis, who have two months to ready their case before the September 9 trial date.Weinstein is charged in New York with sexually assaulting two women, in July 2006 and March 2013. He has pleaded not guilty to the five charges against him, which include rape, and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.Ms Rotunno argues that the #MeToo movement, spurred by revelations about Weinstein’s alleged behaviour is overblown, and that women are “responsible for the choices they make.”She said she chose to represent Weinstein and believes the evidence is “very favourable” toward him.Gloria Allred, the famed womens’ rights lawyer who is representing two of Weinstein’s 70 accusers, said after Thursday’s pretrial hearing that she agrees women are responsible for their own choices.But, she added: “When will Mr Weinstein be held responsible for his?”Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green corridor\u0026#39 to streamline tourism to ChernobylRobot defeats world\u0026#39s top poker players in breakthrough for Artificial IntelligenceGermany classifies Identitarian group as Right-wing extremistsMissing Texan man eaten by his own dogsIntelligence sharing with the US will be harmed if UK uses Huawei in 5G network, says former head of  Homeland Security Saudi Arabia to \u0026#39ease\u0026#39 male ship law restricting women\u0026#39s travelRecord numbers struggle to see GP -

It is also a steep drop from 65 per cent in 2012, although researchers said changes in the way the survey was carried out meant the figures were not directly comparable.Rising numbers turned to A\u0026ampE when their GP practices was closed the figures show.In total, 36.6 per cent ended up at casualty wards in such circumstances, a rise from 32.9 per cent in 2016. Meanwhile, the number of patients facing long waits in A\u0026ampE has soared. In June 2012 just two patients waited 12 hours on a trolley.  Last month, the figure was 471, the data from NHS England shows. In the last 12 months alone, the figure has risen by 376 per cent. The data also shows  4.4 million on waiting lists - a rise of 300,000 in a year, up from 2.6 million in 2012. Labour said the figures were “staggering”.The disclosures, in the height of summer, prompted concern about how the NHS will cope this winter, especially if Britain experiences the levels of flu recently seen during Australia’s winter.Health officials promised to review access to GPs, in order to tackle waiting times.Dr Nikita Kanani, acting director of primary care for NHS England, said: “We will look at making improvements to pre-bookable and same day GP appointments, reviewing patient feedback on face-to-face and online consultations, delivering greater choice and access to appropriate care for patients.”From 2021, all patients will also have a new right to access their general practice through video consultations.The BMA urged ministers to change tax rules on pensions to persuade more doctors to stay in post. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said GPs needed more funding, in order to meet demand. “Patients are finding it increasingly difficult to access the services they need, when they need them, and this must be addressed as a matter of urgency.”She said the long waits were putting patient safety at risk. Helen Buckingham, director of strategy at the Nuffield Trust, said: Our work shows that England is experiencing the first prolonged fall in GPs per person in 50 years, and today\u0027s GP Patient Survey shows the relentless impact this is having on patients.Measures of how easy it is to get an appointment are sliding across the board: fewer than a third of people who hoped to be seen on the same day actually experienced this.For the first time, less than half of people who have a preferred GP say that they are actually able to make an appointment to see them.”Over the past decade, the number of GPs taking early retirement has more than doubled, with 616 such cases last year. It came as the cap on how much savers can amass without being taxed fell from £1.8m in 2012 to £1 million.On Monday Boris Johnson pledged to “fix” the pension crisis, saying he had repeatedly raised thie issue with the Chancellor. The BMA’s chairman yesterday yesterday wrote to both leadership candidates, urging them to take urgent action. In particular the union called for changes to address rules which mean doctors can face marginal tax rates of more than 90 per cent for earnings over £110,000 a year - including any rise in the value of their pensions. In the letter, Dr Chaand Nagpaul said there was “worrying” evidence that the pensions stand-off is damaging patient care, and said more than 60 per cent of consultants were planning early retirement.Towns and villages are facing longer journeys to their nearest GPThe hospital figures represent NHS performance at the start of summer. Senior medics raised fears that health services will be unable to cope if the UK is hit badly by “Australian flu”.Data from Australia  shows 135,952 laboratory-confirmed cases of flu across the country so far this year -compared to a five-year average of 17,349 such cases by this stage in the year. So far the number of deaths is almost three times that for the whole of the flu season last year.Jonathan Ashworth, shadow health and social care secretary, said: “Patients will find it staggering that this summer A\u0026ampE performance so far has actually been worse than it was in the run up to Christmas.“This is an NHS in a year round crisis thanks to years of cutbacks and understaffing,” he said. Jessica Morris, research analyst at the Nuffield Trust, said the number of patients facing long trolley waits this June was higher even than in December last year. In terms of performance, summer is becoming the new winter,” she warned. A spokesman for NHS England said: Hospitals are reporting continuing staffing and bed pressures.Local areas across the NHS are now reviewing the extra staffing and capital investment in facilities and diagnostics they will need for the next five years, ahead of national decisions on these later this year.Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to

navy fends iranian seizure british oil tanker persian","story":"The type 23 frigate HMS Montrose reportedly aimed its guns on the Iranians and told them to move awayThe British government raised its security warning for shipping in Iranian waters to its highest level as the Royal Navy was forced to fend off the attempted obstruction of a British oil tanker by Iranian Revolutionary Guards.British flagged ships were notified at the beginning of this week that Iranian waters were considered a level three, or “critical” security environment, the  understands.The security alert, which amounts to advice to avoid Iranian waters where possible and would have been accompanied by advice on specific precautions to take, came after Iran threatened “reciprocal” action for the recent seizure of an Iranian tanker by the Royal Navy near Gibraltar.  That action appeared to come on Wednesday, when the British Heritage, owned by BP Shipping and registered to the Isle of Man, was approached by three Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps boats as it sailed through Persian Gulf towards the Strait of Hormuz.The Iranians ordered the vessel to stop in nearby Iranian territorial waters, according to the Ministry of Defence, but withdrew after HMS Montrose, a Royal Navy frigate which had been escorting the tanker, aimed its guns on the Iranians and warned them to move away.A Ministry of Defence spokesperson said: “Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.“HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away. The tanker is believed to have been in waters disputed by Iran and the United Arab Emirates when the incident took placeA US aircraft flying overhead filmed the incident, but the footage had not been released by late Thursday evening. The incident is the most serious involving a British ship since the current crisis in the Gulf began and will raise fears that Britain could get dragged into a brewing military confrontation between the United States and Iran in the Gulf.Iran warned last week that it might seize a British oil tanker after Royal Marines boarded and detained the Grace 1, a super tanker carrying two million tons of Iranian oil, as it passed through Gibralatan waters last Thursday.British and Gibraltan authorities say they suspect the ship of running oil to Syria, in breach of EU sanctions, and have denied the move was targeted at Iran.  Police in Gibraltar said on Thursday that they have arrested and interviewed under caution the Grace 1\u0027s captain and chief officer on suspicion of breaching EU sanctions on Syria, in a move likely to further inflame tensions.Neither man has yet been charged. Iran\u0027s revolutionary guard denied attempting to seize the British Heritage, but a senior commander also warned that Britain would strongly regret detaining the Grace 1 .If the enemy had made the smallest assessment they wouldn\u0027t have done this act, said Rear-Admiral Ali Fadavi on Thursday. Our reciprocal action will be announced.  Iran earlier described the seizure of Grace 1 as an act of piracy and accused Britain of bowing to US pressure to hinder its attempts to export oil under the terms of the 2015 nuclear deal.Gulf of OmanMohsen Rezaei, a general in the Revolutionary Guard Corps and an advisor to Iran’s supreme leader, on Friday warned Iran might go after a British tanker.  And President Hassan Rouhani called the seizure of the vessel mean and wrong during a Cabinet meeting on Wednesday.He warned London: You are an initiator of insecurity and you will understand its repercussions, without elaborating.Oil companies have warned that continued disruption around the Strait of Hormuz, which handles up to a third of the world\u0027s seaborne oil exports, could have a dramatic impact on petrol prices.There are usually between 15 and 30 British flagged ships operating in the vicinity of the strait at any given day, more than the Royal Navy can realistically provide escorts for.Besides HMS Montrose, a type 23 frigate, the Royal Navy has four minesweepers and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Cardigan Bay in the region.  Britain is also a member of a 33-nation Combined Maritime Force with a mandate to protect shipping in the Western Indian Ocean from piracy and terrorism.The United States has said it wants a new international force to guarantee freedom of navigation in the Persian gulf, although it has yet to lay out those plans in detail.Last month Donald Trump called of military strikes against the Islamic Republic after it shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz.Tensions in the Persian Gulf have risen dramatically since Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal in May 2018 and imposed a series of punishing sanctions on the Islamic Republic, including measures designed to prevent it exporting oil.Britain, France, and Germany have defended the deal, including Iran\u0027s right to export oil,  but Iran has complained the European powers have done too little to help it continue to trade.It began to violate the deal\u0027s restrictions on uranium enrichment in protest last week.A spokesman for BP, which operates the British Heritage tanker, said: Our top priority is the safety and security of our crews and vessels.

There was no immediate comment from the Saudi government.The decision, which has not been officially announced but is reported to have been made “at the top”, comes after several high-profile cases of Saudi women requesting asylum abroad having fled their families.Saudi women\u0026#39s rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul was arrested last year after campaigning for the abolishment of male ship lawsMale ship laws related to women’s right to marry, work, leave prison and a number of other rights, however, would still be in place.The issue of male ship is extremely sensitive in the kingdom, where traditional, tribal families view what they consider to be the protection of women as a man\u0027s duty.Women, even as adults, can be prevented from doing anything from travelling, marrying, renting, and working without permission.There is even a government app that helps alert male s if female relatives try to check in at any of the kingdom’s airports.Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s had promised a tranche of reforms aimed at liberalising and opening up the country to the world.The royal court announced a decision to allow women to drive after a decades-long ban in late 2017. But before the new law came into force the following June, more than a dozen women\u0027s rights activists who had campaigned for the right to drive and against ship system were arrested.Saudi Arabia\u0026#39s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends a plenary session on the second day of the G20 Leader\u0026#39s Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina.A number are still being held more than a year on, raising questions as to the seriousness of Prince Mohammed’s vision for the kingdom.Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, drew worldwide attention when she barricaded herself in an airport hotel room in Bangkok in January after fleeing her family during a trip to Kuwait.Her social media pleas on Twitter prompted quick action by the UNHCR and she was granted asylum in Canada.Miss Qunun\u0027s successful escape inspired others to copy her and a number of other women fled abroad to seek asylum, including Maha al-Subaie, 28, and Wafa al-Subaie, 25, who claimed from Georgia that they were being badly treated by their father. Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun arrives at Toronto Pearson International AirportSaudi observers say that dismantling the law and customs will not be easy, particularly in more rural, conservative areas outside cosmopolitan cities such as Riyadh and Jeddah. Even loosening the rules on foreign travel could fuel disapproval if it leads to many women leaving the country.“Saudi has promised to end ship system over the past decade at least a few times at the UN Human Rights Council sessions,” tweeted Sarah Leah Whitson, executive director of the Middle East and North Africa ision at Human Rights Watch. “But it has only done it in dribs and drabs. But this will be a big deal if promise is kept.“Keep in mind, the women who have struggled and sacrificed for years to end the male ship system remain jailed and face long prison sentences for no reason than having demanded what the government has now promised to do.”Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green corridor\u0026#39 to

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Britain\u0026#39s worst female paedophile to be released from prisonUkraine announces \u0026#39green

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Firing people is expensive and disruptive so companies only move when they have to, when\u0026nbspthings have clearly entered a downward\u0026nbspspiral.But recruitment behaves a little differently. One way employers respond if they see troubles ahead is by delaying it. They put off making decisions and let things ride until they have a clearer idea of the outlook. If that’s what is starting to happen, the results of companies like Michael Page are where you’ll see it first. \u0026nbspOn the face of it, the latest set of numbers look rather good. The company touted a record quarter with 16 countries growing by 10 per cent or more. Despite this, the share price resembled the final part of a rollercoaster on its\u0026nbsprelease, the sharp e just before everyone gets off and reaches for the sick bag (in the case of the parents).\u0026nbspTough crowd? Not really. The market is less interested in Michael Page’s successful past than it is in what’s coming. The company was punished because it warned that its profits will likely be at the lower end of the market’s expectations as a result of “the current macroeconomic conditions”.\u0026nbspIn English, Michael\u0026nbspPage\u0026nbspis telling us that it’s worried about the global economy slowing and hitting hiring. The signs of that were all over the trading statement.\u0026nbspThe economy is a small boat tossed by the waves of political madnessThe £183m British Airways fine is a game-changer for consumersOcado’s tech gobbledygook has investors in a tizzy Having added more than 600 fee-earners in the first quarter of the year, its\u0026nbspnumbers fell by 122 in the second. Growth in gross profits from temporary hires was much faster than that from permanent placements. If you’re worried about the future but you have a gap, it makes sense to fill it with a\u0026nbsptemp, particularly in places where firing is difficult and expensive (such as France).For those of us living in the Brexit-battered UK, the situation looks worse. This country is the only one of the markets that Michael\u0026nbspPage breaks out to show a decline in gross profits.\u0026nbspIts numbers don’t give a picture of the entire UK labour force, but they still don’t bode at all well for the future. They chime with the Employment Index put out by business adviser BDO at the start of the week. It fell to its lowest level in a year, moving partner Peter Hemington to opine that “the glory years of rising UK employment figures could be coming to an end”.\u0026nbspSo that canary? It’s starting to struggle for breath as the global economy catches a chill. But in Britain it’s on the floor of its cage, gasping.\u0026nbspWe’re just starting to feel\u0026nbspthe whirlwind of the Brexiteers’ folly. Boris Johnson banging on about optimism and believing in Britain won’t come as much comfort if the hiring delays, or even recruitment freezes, Brexit is causing start to turn into widespread redundancy programmes.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They succeeded by offering a lot of value to consumers first and foremost, but also to marketers.Before them, if a firm wanted a consumer to read (F) something, buy (A) something, install (A) something, watch (N) something, or search (G) for something, there were not many other options.But thanks to a new generation of companies, marketers are about to have a lot more options.\u0026nbspPrediction #1: Every company that has a direct relationship with users and access to data will eventually get into advertising.When you reach consumers and you have access to data, you’ll eventually realise the value in monetising that audience beyond your core product – with ads.Advertising is a $600bn-plus-a-year business, and the “marketing market” is even greater than that as it includes all the activities necessary to bring a product or service all the way to the consumer. So a piece of it, even if it’s a small one, is too tempting to pass up.\u0026nbspTake Amazon as an example. It expanded into advertising only around three years ago and has since become the third-largest advertising company in the US, with $18bn in revenue from the business stream. Even Apple, which for all intents and purposes is not an advertising company, is expected to generate $2bn in search ads in the app store by 2020. \u0026nbspThe only reason a company would choose not to enter the advertising business is if it doesn’t reach enough consumers or if it doesn’t have its own data.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 26Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.126 Project Scarlett to succeed Xbox OneMicrosoft announced Project Scarlett, the successor to the Xbox One, at E3 2019.

E-commerce companies like Wayfair and Boxed built alternative marketplaces for groups of like-minded customers. Brands such as mattress maker Casper or Dollar Shave Club pioneered new subscription models based around brand story and community, disrupting Sleepy’s and P\u0026ampG’s Gillette, respectively. These companies’ most valuable asset is always their customer relationships (and data) whether they stay private, go public or get acquired.\u0026nbspThis new generation of post-FAANG-era companies is here to stay.\u0026nbspRising stars like Pinterest and Airbnb will continue to thrive, creating new user-friendly online spaces that are compelling in their own right. Activity on these owned-and-operated mobile apps and websites generates hugely valuable troves of first-party data, which can then be used to improve user experience, strengthen customer relationships and convert users into advocates. This virtuous cycle offers a more sustainable and differentiated growth strategy for the rising generation of consumer brands.And in the end, everybody will tap into the advertising market, offering various businesses the option to be promoted natively within their environment.\u0026nbspLast prediction: I’m optimistic about the future of advertisers, and this trajectory is great for consumers.\u0026nbspThese new and emerging companies are evidence that a new era has arrived. While no one can afford to wean themselves entirely off any single major platform, the recent IPOs and those still to come prove there is a huge wave of new companies that will give advertisers more choice.\u0026nbspBoth established and emerging brands will continue to advertise across FAANG, but with more advertising channels in their arsenal. I’m optimistic as there will be less concentration, more value for money and more access to the data advertisers need to succeed.\u0026nbspThis is particularly great for consumers because if advertisers have choices outside of FAANG, their advertising costs will decrease and their product prices won’t have to increase in response.\u0026nbspThese are exciting times for any company or investor looking to engage consumers. We are about to see a whole new crop of marketing companies, and this is great for all of us.\u0026nbspAdam Singolda\u0026nbspis the founder and chief executive of Taboola.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumLarry the cat sits in the street, at Downing Street in LondonBut it goes further and questions the very practice of passing platform\u0026nbspfees onto investors.“If a platform offers superior service to advisers, increasing operational efficiencies, is it fair that customers should pay for these very indirect benefits?” AFH asks in the report.In another quirk of the current system, adviser platforms are chosen by advisers but are paid for by consumers, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pointed out in a report published in March.AFH suggests that financial advisory firms should absorb the cost of platform fees and do so without increasing other charges to make up for the expense.“Unlike ongoing adviser charges and active fund management, which seek to add direct value for clients, platform costs are a dead weight and only subtract from performance,” the firm says.The FCA stopped short of making the same recommendation in its report on investment platforms.AFH also found broader uncertainty about fees among a quarter of investors: 8 per cent of those surveyed were confused about what they pay for, an equal share didn’t understand the fees they pay, and another 8 per cent weren’t even aware they pay any fees.The share of perplexed investors was matched almost exactly by the 26 per cent of advisers who said they had always felt uncomfortable talking about fees and charges.\u0026nbsp“Perhaps they feel they can’t justify their expense or there are simply too many charges to explain,” AFH says.\u0026nbspThe research is based on two online surveys carried out in November, involving 221 financial advisers in the UK and 1,026 British adults with over £100,000 in personal savings who have seen a financial adviser.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And experts say the weaker pound since the EU referendum could have made Britain even more attractive as it is a cheaper place to study.Were the fears of vice-chancellors and academics about the Brexit vote unfounded? It seems too early to say.It is likely that some European applicants will be trying to get into the British system before tuition fees go up and they are no longer entitled to student loans.EU students starting at English universities this year are still eligible for domestic tuition fees, which are £9,250 a year, and student loans. They will also retain these benefits for courses starting in 2020.EU students in England will pay same tuition fees year after BrexitHowever, the fee status and financial support offered to students from Europe could change for the worse in the years after the UK exits the EU, which would make studying in Britain less appealing.European students could be deterred from applying to a UK university if they are made to pay tuition fees of up to £18,000 a year – which international students from outside the EU currently pay.Leaders of universities across the country will breathe a collective sigh of relief at the Ucas data showing that non-UK students still want to study in Britain. But is it just the calm before the storm?\u0026nbspThe Russell Group,\u0026nbspcomprising the most selective universities in the UK, has already seen a drop in the number of EU students enrolling in its institutions. Numbers fell for the first time in five years, figures show.And the situation could get worse with a no-deal Brexit as research funding would be up in the air and greater uncertainty could put off EU students from studying at UK universities.So while the positive trend in the Ucas report is welcome, the full impact of Brexit is yet to be seen.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

The early modern humans in Greece were replaced by Neanderthals. It was not one exodus out of Africa but lots of small ones.”Scientists rethink human evolution after discovery of ancient tools ‘Neanderthal-like’ teeth reveal early human evolution in EuropeEarly human evolution was ‘multi-ethnic and multicultural’The research, published in the journal\u0026nbspNature, supports the hypothesis that early modern humans spread out of Africa, where they evolved multiple times.This group was probably wiped out by environmental factors – which could have included climatic events and pressure from Neanderthals.Reconstructions of the Apidima 1 cranium revealed a high and rounded shape – a unique feature of modern humans which contrasts sharply with Neanderthals.Researchers conducted numerous comparisons with different human fossils, using\u0026nbspa highly accurate radiometric dating method to determine their age. They also used virtual reconstructions of the damaged parts of the skulls to discover more about the origins of the fossils.\u0026nbspThis discovery is the latest piece in the jigsaw of human evolution which is continually changing in light of new research.Out of Africa\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility\u0027. Clark Mindock reports from the Canyon of Heroes in ManhattanClick to followThe Independent USWith confetti and ticker tape landing on the shoulders of champions and their fans along the Canyon of Heroes in downtown Manhattan, Emma Morrone saw something bigger than the elite players returning to the United States after their World Cup win in France.In the floats that carried the likes of Megan Rapinoe, Alex Morgan, and Julie Ertz,\u0026nbspalongside the rest of the world championship squad,\u0026nbspthe 17-year-old football player –\u0026nbspor “soccer player” as she, and those around her, would call it here in the US –\u0026nbspsaid she saw role models, not just passing stars.And, the New Jersey high school senior said that she hopes she sees the future in those women who have inspired a nation with their athleticism, and spurred a conversation about equity and rights in America and abroad.“We look up to them, and how they play, and take from their game, learn from their moves,” Ms Morrone said, referring to herself and her two teammates who had made the trek from New Jersey on Wednesday morning, 17-year-old Caitlin Scully and 18-year-old Alex Pardo.That is, they are learning moves from them both on and off the pitch. They see what the US Women’s National Team has done to promote pay equality, an issue that persists for the women in spite of their clear strengths compared to the US men’s team. They see how the players have spoken about and promoted a general sense that one must stand up to bigotry, in general.They want to learn those moves, too.“I think they’re really amazing,” Ms Pardo added. “They make me want to be a better player, and make me want to become involved. When your role model speaks up, it makes you want to speak up.”It wouldn’t be long until Rapinoe herself spoke up once again, hoping to inspire fans like those three teens. On the steps of New York’s City Hall, the co-captain of the world champion team extolled fans to lead in their own lives, and to take on the challenges of making the world a better place.“We have to be better. We have to love more, hate less. We have to listen more, and talk less. We have to know that this is everybody’s responsibility,” Rapinoe said with circular sunglasses reminiscent of John Lennon, and purple hair.She continued, saying that their supporters are more than just fans of a sport who “tune in every four years”.“You interact with your community every single day,” she said. “How do you make your community better?”Rapinoe: US women’s captain sends powerful message to Trump over LGBT+ rightsRapinoe saying ‘I deserve this’ while holding a trophy and a bottle of champagne is a serious moodWith their 2-0 victory over the Netherlands last week, and the run of wins leading up to that world cup victory, the US women’s team has catapulted themselves into the forefront of a national conversation, and the players have proven eager to embrace their platformThey’re currently engaged in that fight for pay equity, with a class action lawsuit including all of the players suing the US Soccer Federation, saying they get paid less than the men’s national team and receive less support, even though they consistently outperform those same men.The proof of that is pretty clear: This year’s World Cup win is the second straight for the American women, while the men’s team didn’t even make it into the same tournament last year. That’s not even accounting for the hard dollars, with women’s games bringing in $50.8m in game revenue between 2016 and 2018, compared to $49.9m for men during that period. The pay structure is complicated, but the women have argued in their lawsuit that there are a range of inequities, including the argument that if they played 20 “friendlies” (where bonuses would not apply), they would earn a maximum of $99,000 while men max out at $263,320 for the same play.That fight, and their representation of the US in France, has brought them some enemies and friends in high places. Senators Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris –\u0026nbsptwo presidential candidates, whose merchandise could be seen repped by fans along the parade route on Wednesday – have both praised them. Donald Trump has gotten into fights with them on Twitter.Rapinoe says US Women’s team accept Chuck Schumer’s invite to congress but ‘don’t want to go to the White House’Elizabeth Redwine was among the mothers to line up to catch a glimpse of the champions, and had brought her 11-year-old daughter Lila, and her two friends Ella and Emily.Ms Redwine had picked up a piece of paper from the trash on her way in, and used her lipstick to write a message of solidarity: Equal pay for superior work, her sign read.“I want them to one day be paid as much as their brothers,” she said of the three girls she had brought to see the historic occasion, all three of them athletes.Maggie Gannon, a 24-year-old teacher who moved to New York City from Ohio from Wisconsin on Tuesday, said she chose to start her first full day in the city at the parade because the team is “bringing a voice for young girls and the marginalised”.She said that the chants of “equal pay” that were heard both in Manhattan on Wednesday and in France last week have resonated throughout the country.“We were sitting in a Buffalo Wild Wings in Ohio, chanting with them,” Ms Gannon said, recalling watching the World Cup final.Joanne Shea, a 33-year-old actor, had come with her 18-month-old daughter Maeve, and said that the US women’s team had restored a sense of national pride at a time when she said there are slim pickings.“There’s not been a whole heck of a lot to celebrate lately when it comes to national pride,” Ms Shea said.But, noting that there have been some positive signs in the past few years. In the 2018 midterms, for instance, more women ran for and were elected into Congress than ever before. And, now, the country is taking cues from, and talking about, and obsessing over the women’s World Cup champions that have become the standard bearers of a host of equality issues.“This team has really been a symbol of that,” Ms Shea said. “I think since 2016, women have really been leading the fight.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iranian boats in the Gulf have for years harassed US and other ships moving out of the waterway, drawing too close\u0026nbspin what American officials often dismissed as annoyances.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“Why do you commit such acts?” he said. “You should instead allow navigation to be safe.”On Thursday, Mr\u0026nbspZarif\u0026nbsprejected the claims that Iran had sought to seize the ship. “They make such claims to create tension, yet these claims are worthless and they have made many such claims,” he told reporters, according to the semi-official\u0026nbspISNA\u0026nbspnews agency. “They say such things to cover up their own weaknesses.”Russia, which has increasingly asserted itself in the Middle East as a broker and spoiler, called for restraint and “unconditional” freedom of navigation following the incident, but refused to endorse either the UK or Iranian version of events. President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency the Kremlin had “registered the information that such an incident has allegedly taken place, and we have also registered the statement by Iranian representatives that this information does not correspond\u0026nbspto reality”.Asked whether the UK planned to step up its military presence in the region to enhance protection to shipping, a Downing Street spokesman said: “We have a long-standing maritime presence in the Gulf. We are continuously monitoring the security situation there and are committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law.”\u0026nbspPressed on whether the UK saw Wednesday’s incident as a response to the seizure of\u0026nbspGrace I, the spokesman said: “I’m not going to speculate on Iran’s motivations. Our position from last week stands. We’ve been very clear that\u0026nbspGrace I\u0026nbspis a Syria sanctions issue, rather than an Iran issue.”Media reports suggested that British-flagged ships in the Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsphad now been put on “heightened security” following new guidance from the Department for Transport.A spokesperson from the department told The Independent that they were unable to comment on the reports.The alleged confrontation in the Gulf took place as the US reportedly demanded at a closed-door meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)\u0026nbspin Vienna that the world take action against Iran for breaching its commitments under the nuclear deal, even as Washington itself had withdrawn from the agreement at the behest of Beltway Iran hawks, Israel, and Gulf Arab monarchs.\u0026nbspAccording to statements by\u0026nbspIranian and Russian officials, US officials failed to gain traction at the IAEA as much of the world remains committed to upholding it despite relatively minor breaches by Iran that Tehran describes as responses for the failure to remove impediments to trade with the Islamic Republic.\u0026nbspUS terminates support for anti-Iran project that ‘smeared US citizens’Iran nuclear deal at threat over UK seizure of oil tanker in GibraltarBP tanker ‘shelters off Saudi Arabia amid fears Iran could seize it’Iran announces new breach of 2015 nuclear dealIran will increase uranium enrichment to ‘any amount we want’Tehran has offered to return to the agreement, but the US president has rejected the deal, arguing it was too generous to Iran and did not address its involvement in regional conflicts.In May, the US dispatched an aircraft carrier, bombers and fighter jets to the Gulf in response to alleged Iranian threats.The US has also accused Iran of being involved in the bombing of oil tankers in the Gulf and said it shot down an American drone in international airspace.Iran has denied any involvement in the attacks on the tankers and said the drone had veered into its airspace.Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The nuclear threat once again seems real.“Relations between the great powers have been going from bad to worse for several years now. The advocates for arms build-up and the military-industrial complex are rubbing their hands.“We must break out of this situation. We need to resume political dialogue aiming at joint decisions and joint action.”HBO and Sky Atlantics Chernobyl featured Gorbachev in its first episode.The first episode sees the leader of the Soviet Union take part in a meeting where it is decided to hush up the tragic events.Gorbachev is played by David Dencik, who has appeared in a number of other big-name TV and film projects.Dencik is from Sweden, making him one of a number of the Chernobyl cast members who are actually Scandinavian playing Russians and Ukrainians in the HBO and Sky co-production.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

that time.He decided his birthday festivities would be combined with a military parade known as the Trooping the Colour, which was held in spring.Since then, the tradition for two separate birthdays happens today.Queen Elizabeth II was born on April  but her second birthday date changes every year.It is usually held on a Saturday in June, often the second one, for convenience.The “official” birthday is still celebrated by the Trooping the Colour procession.Her Majesty is joined by other members of the Royal Family at the parade, which moves between Buckingham Palace, The Mall and Horseguards’ Parade.She also makes a public appearance on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.This year her official birthday took place on June .The Queen is , making her the oldest monarch to have

series has urged tourists to show respect.Chernobyl is a ghost city in the restricted Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, where a power plant explosion claimed the lives of dozens of people  years ago.At least  people died following exposure to radiation, but the World Health Organisation has estimated that thousands of people could eventually be exposed to fatal radiation.Chernobyl is situated in northern Kieve Oblast in Ukraine, near the border with Belarus.The site and the nearby city of Pripyat were evacuated on April , ,  hours after the most disastrous nuclear accident in history.Pripyat, a city of , people and far closer to the power plant than Chernobyl itself, was built in the s as a home for the power plant workers.The city and surrounding area have been largely deserted ever since - although an estimated , tourists visited in .The site and Pripyat have been safe for tourists to visit since .Visitors have to be screened before they enter the Exclusion Zone and are told not to touch anything within the cordon.There are around  villages in the Exclusion Zone - the -mile radius around the power plant.Ukraines president announced on Wednesday that it was planning to launch a plan to turn the abandoned ghost town into an official tourist site.President Volodymyr Zelensky said that he wanted to open up the site in a bid to improve the areas reputation.There will be new walking trails and better mobile phone reception in the area as part of the plans, according to the BBC, which means the tourists who visit will be able to get close to the haunting sights of the disaster zone and post what they see straight onto social media.Filming restrictions at the site will also be lted, meaning that people could potentially live stream their experience.And there will also be waterways and checkpoints to safe guard visitors.According to President Volodymyr Zelensky, the country will also be introducing a new ticketing system, which they hope would reduce the corruption in the area.Previously, tourists could only visit the site with a guide - or enter illegally - and there were occasions where local police would need to be bribed.Scientists, ecologists, and historians will also be given better access to the site.Holiday companies offer packages that give an official tour of the Exclusion Zone.The ghost town also includes a school that features in Call of Duty - an abandoned Ferris wheel and homes frantically deserted when evacuation began.The eerie site has since become a lewd hotspot for Instagram influencers to capture the perfect selfie in light of the recent gripping Sky Original series Chernobyl, which aired in May-June  on Sky Atlantic.Social media influencers have come in droves to visit the ghostly wreckage -  one was seen posing half naked in a G-string and a hazmet suit.The shows writer, Craig Mazine, said its wonderful that a wave of people had visited.But he urged visitors to remember that a terrible tragedy occurred there.Comport yourselves with respect for all who suffered and sacriced, he wrote on Twitter."},{"url":null,"title":"sun readers debate boris hunt live","story":"The two final contenders to be

Equality, dignity and the right of self-determination for millions of women across the Middle East is at stake.Princess Haya is the sixth we of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum – Prime Minister and ruler of Dubai.The -year-old is the younger half-sister of King Abdullah II of Jordan.She was educated at Oxford University, and represented Jordan at the Sydney Olympics in , in showjumping.In , Princess Haya married Sheikh Mohammed – who founded Britains biggest racing stables, Godolphin.According to her official website, sport has been a dominant part of le for Princess Haya since childhood.Having experienced the power of sport in her own le, she works tirelessly to give others, especially young girls, a similar experience.Showjumping remains a strong passion, with the royal being a former president of the International Equestrian Federation, and a member of the International Olympic Committee.Her website explains that she has been motivated by the belief that sport improves lives, empowers women and breaks down barriers between people and nations.Apart from being involved in humanitarian work, Princess Haya is also the vice-president of the Royal Windsor Horse Show and, up until recently, was regularly photographed at this and other major events on the racing calendar.In an interview with Emirates Woman three years ago, Princess Haya said that she always wanted to be a journalist as shes passionate about newspapers and magazines.She spoke glowingly about her two children, daughter Sheikha Al Jalila, and son Sheikh Zayed, who apparently loves the desert and everything that papa does.The Sheikh is said to have asked authorities in Berlin tothe princess, son Zayed, seven, and daughter Al Jalila, , to the UAE.But they have refused and security officials are said to be protecting her.This has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Germany and the UAE.Since Princess Haya disappeared, Sheikh Mohammed has denounced his we in a rant on Instagram, accusing her of “betrayal”, adding: “Go to whom you get busy with!!!!! ”"},{"url":null,"title":"next leader prioritise veterans end witch hunts","story":"Those who serve our country should never be forgotten. But too often, especially as the memory of wars in Afghanistan and Iraq fades, they have been shunted down the policy pecking order.Previous Governments have, to their credit, taken steps in the right direction. But their activities have often been piecemeal or lacking in an overall direction.Giving the money from interest rate-rigging fines to armed forces charities is a good example.A promise of nearly £bn, but a promise that hasn’t been delivered as fully as it should have been, with Ministers even dipping into the pot to cover shortfalls in their own budgets.We need a sea change — and that’s why we’ve partnered with Help for Heroes and Combat Stress to demand a Cabinet Minister takes the reins on this vital issue under a Johnson or Hunt Government.And that Minister mustn’t just be there to turn up for photo ops at far-flung bases. They must drive through a firmer commitment to the Military Covenant and, vitally, work with the Attorney General to end the persecution of veterans from former conflicts.Everybody who has served has put their le on the line for us — and their families have sacriced plenty, too.Time to deliver.EVERY time you think they can’t sink any lower, Labour’s leadership finds a way.This once great party is now run by a rabble of apologists for anti-Semitism, Marxists and bullies.They think nothing of spending their members’ cash on expensive law firms in an attempt to throttle the free press.And when it comes to policy, their combination of two-faced doublespeak on Brexit and a cripplingly expensive nationalisation programme would send the UK economy into a nosee it might never recover from.Yet still there are decent MPs on those Labour backbenches who think the tide will turn, that evenCorbyn was to enter Downing Street he could somehow be managed. Codswallop.It’s put up or shut up time for them.BOTH Tory candidates to be next PM have promised to deliver Brexit, deal or no deal.It’s the only hope the party has of remaining relevant.So when they take office, they have a mandate to deliver their promises in the leadership contest. Including those on the European Union.That means those Tory MPs who are still dead-set on crippling the Government’s Exit strategy by stopping a clean break are not just turning their noses up at their own members.They’re risking the future of the party.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Not a regular port of call because I’m a Good Morning Britain devotee thanks, in no small part, to the Great Sussex Doughnut hole, Piers Morgan, who took one look at its saccharine sweet format, back in , and thought: “Sod that for roasting politicians and a few home truths.”His tabloid instincts didn’t let him down. Its predecessor GMTV used to be such an easy ride Gordon Brown actually offered its host Fiona Phillips a Government job.These days, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and PM-in-waiting Boris Johnson are both too spineless to go anywhere near the GMB studio.BBC pay was the big story last week, though, so I had to desert ship for Breakfast, where I immediately discovered no one’s paid quite enough to work a five-day week and a squad rotation system is at play.Thursday and Friday it was the horribly mismatched Charlie “errr” Stayt and Naga Munchetty, who are both on £, but have so little on-screen chemistry they make Piers’ and Susanna’s squabbling sound more like Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin — Je t’aime . . . moi non plus, Chunk.Star pairing, however, are the undoubtedly talented and likeable Dan Walkerand Louise Minchinwho can actually bear to look at her co-host and almost won me over with Wednesday’s first link of the day. “Day three of Wimbledon and Carolisn’t looking quite so lovely.”No. And you should see her at the end of the fortnight, Louise.It’s not the clumsiness or the lack of chemistry, though, that make Breakfast feel like you’re stuck with Saturday Superstore when Tiswas is on the other side. It’s the content, which is a marathon BBC right-on whinge.So you seem to get a “gender equality row” , followed by environmental armageddon and an “NHS funding crisis”, every day.Three hours of that and, I promise, you’ll feel like you’ve been embalmed by pulped copies of .Ironically, the show also doesn’t seem to like anyone with a large salary and, on Wednesday, Tesco’s Dave Lewis was being asked by Steph McGovernhe was: “comfortable getting paid what you do”.The brass neck it took to include that segment is quite something when you consider it had absolutely nothing to say about its own scandalously huge wage bill on Wednesday.They even tried to gloss over it during the paper review when the story flashed up on the front page of every newspaper, although Dan Walker did admit: “Lots of people contacting us on that. We always appreciate your feedback.”I hope, then, that Dan Walker appreciates me saying his show’s hypocrisy is every bit as nauseating as the BBC’s excess, ’cos no autocue reader should be paid anything more than £, when pensioners are having to pay for their licence.AndBBC staffers don’t like that figure  Well, they’re free to offer their talents to the private sector and I’ll be sure to tip Naga Munchetty heavily when she arrives with my Deliveroo order, as I really liked the pointed question she posed about a nuisance barnyard animal, on Friday’s paper review.“Is anyone interested in a noisy cock ”To my own surprise and horror, I am.

Not all the viewers, obviously.Just those few hundred who’ve got Ofcom on speed-dial and are forever accusing someone of “gaslighting” or claiming someone  needs to be removed “for their own safety”.Clearly no one’s explained to these cretins it’s an ITV dating show, not Channel ’s Dispatches, and objecting to jealousy or lust not only misses the show’s entire point, it threatens to ruin the meagre pleasures of watching Love Island.For me, last week, that mainly involved trying to catch a single glimpse of George the builder, a blond Essex vacuum, who’d been looking like the sparest part inLove Island history, until “partner” Lucie and Maura pulled him and Marvin aside for a Sunday night chat. Can he fix it Maura: “I’ve tried, she’s tried. There’s no point in prolonging this bulls**t. That’s it.”No he can’t.Top Gear jumping on the rainbow flag-waving bandwagon with the emptiest Pride gesture of all time.People who say “challenging behaviour” when they mean “disruptive little turd”.Snowflake Love Island fans complaining about absolutely everything.Loose Woman Janet Street-Porter constantly name-dropping all her famous friends .And the Norwich City fan, on Channel ’s Drag SOS, who thought the way to stand out from the Carrow Road crowd was wearing a tutu and wig, when ten fingers and two eyes really would’ve done it.EASTENDERS had a real opportunity recently.Louise Mitchell was locked in a shipping container, bound for Odessa, in the Ukraine, with plenty of space for the rest of the deadwood, Denise, Hunter, Kim, Denny, Bobby, Honey, Sonia, Bernie, Robbie and Adam, who could all have been as quickly for- gotten as Ben Mitchell’s forgotten he’s deaf.Instead, some imbecile left a mobile phone inside the container, she escaped and the moment was gone for ever.

But I had no idea how sneeringly “modern feudal” the whole circus was about to become.What a dismal little VIP gathering Archie’s christening has turned out to be. A PR disaster.Harry and Meghan insisted on conducting the whole thing in secret, refusing even to reveal who his godparents were.I don’t even care who they are —they are Robbie Williams or that plastic Canadian friend of Meghan’s who looks like a Love Island reject, I’d rather not know.But why make such a snitty point of it unless he’s trolling the very people who admire him It seems so unjoyful — the opposite of what a christening is meant to be.I know what his arguments are. He wants a “normal” le for Archie. He hates the Press and the paparazzi.But the truth is the royals get a huge amount of privacy. They have far more privacy than the average citizen.They are not snapped while picking their noses at a newsagent. They are not filmed going on holiday. No one knows where they go on holiday or even where they are when they are not performing their duties.No one sells stories on their private lives or punts pictures. No one takes pictures or follows them at all, because no newspaper would carry the images.Eventhey are spotted by someone, they have huge security teams, paid for by us, to keep us at bay.The royals do not want privacy, they want a private le in public, and no one has the right to that.In spite of this, Harry appears to have gone what I would describe as the full Hugh Grant. Last week it turned out that the actor has become so obsessed with the idea that the paps were following him he confronted an Italian official who was innocently filming rubbish dumped in the street.Everywhere Harry looks, he sees people who want to take advantage of him, which is not true and leads to this sad irascibility in which he forgets what is kind and decent —  and who is paying the bill.What has become of him  If you scan Meghan and Harry’s Instagram feed, you will see how distant the “people’s prince” has turned out. There is no shortage of cloying information on how much he “cares” about alpacas and Mothering Sunday and advancing his sanctimonious “monthly social awareness approach” on mental health or climate change. But it is extra-ordinary how detached from reality the whole thing feels — it is a syrupy, fantasist’s medley of posturing sub-Beyoncean baloney about animals in “gap yah” locations.But does he really care about any of this stuff It is almost ashe has picked a selection of vague, non-committal subjects specically engineered to give no idea what he is thinking, like Leonardo DiCaprio.The overall effect is truly insincere.While it is clear Harry loves the royal tradition of virtue-signalling, it is obvious he does not enjoy being a royal at all. In fact, he dislikes being royal so much, he has waved through this shell of a person called “Prince Harry” operated by an American marketing droid who writes about “sharing” Harry’s “environmental POV”.There are half a million likes for a snap of the prince looking bored.Meghan has similarly vanished.If she had her way, it would not even be a christening, but a naming ceremony with fire pit curators and celebrity mixologists and D-list actresses as earth parents .She is so embarrassing I wonderedit was the godparents who had actually begged for privacy — you can just imagine Beyonce weighing up whether a second-tier royal christening was cool enough for her to openly acknowledge it.And so we have it: A royal christening in a building we paid for, conducted by a bishop whose salary we help foot, featuring royals whose lives we bankroll, in clothes we have paid for, sitting on seats we bought, waited on by staff we fund, with celebs who are not even sure they want to put their name to it.And they think they can say, “Oh, we’re not telling you anything about it” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After months of dithering, he has finally come out for Remain.From now on, Labour is to be an unashamedly pro-EU movement, dedicated to overturning the  referendum result. Once the voice of the oppressed working class, Labour is now to be the mouthpiece of the Europhile political class.Yesterday, having succumbed to relentless pressure from his anti-Brexit MPs, Corbyn announced that Labour will campaign to stay in the European Union and vote against any deal negotiated by the next Conservative Prime Minister.It is a historic decision, one that graphically shows how Labour has lost both its political compass and its moral authority.The move represents a profound betrayal in every sense — of true democracy, of Labour’s traditions, of its heartland voters and of the cause of national freedom. Corbyn has also savagely betrayed his own values, for he has always been a Eurosceptic who regarded the EU as a barrier to national rights.Now he has emerged as just another identikit member of the chattering, snobbish metropolitan elite, which holds sovereignty and patriotism in contempt.Recently there were reports that when Corbyn was considering a change of stance, his tough Chief of Staff Karie Murphy shouted at him: “We’re not doing that. We’re not selling out our class.” But that is exactly what Corbyn has done.In the process, he has torn up Labour’s democratic credentials and made a mockery of the party’s manesto commitment in the  General Election to “respect the referendum result”.Now Corbyn has shown those words were empty. Labour can no longer pretend it has any belief in the ballot box or any faith in voters.The party was created in  to represent working people in their struggle against the political establishment. Central to the party was a belief in national, democratic sovereignty and a profound hostility to imperialism.That helps to explain why, for decades, Labour was so suspicious of the project for European integration. Clement Attlee refused to have anything to do with the European Coal and Steel Community, the forerunner of the Brussels empire, while his successor Hugh Gaitskell warned that Common Market membership would mean: “The end of , years of history.” In , under Michael Foot, the party openly campaigned for withdrawal from the European Community.But all that soon changed. Under Neil Kinnock, the party — regularly beaten in general elections — began to see Brussels as a vehicle for the introduction of socialism into Britain without the need for support from voters. Labour’s rampant European enthusiasm was born, and quickly entrenched by Tony Blair.It was a development that dismayed me.Through much of the s and s I was a Labour activist in Jeremy Corbyn’s Islington North constituency and I shared his views on Brussels.Indeed, his Euro-scepticism was the only thing I admired about him. But I could not stomach Blair’s servile devotion to Brussels. Disillusioned, I left Labour in .Now Labour’s capture by the pro-EU ideologues is complete. “Labour’s hearts are Remain and our values are Remain,” declared the Deputy Leader Tom Watson recently. The party that once campaigned against imperialism now wants us to be subsumed in the EU’s federalist empire.This shameful step has been dressed up as a political necessity because Labour is haemorrhaging political support, down to just  per cent in one recent opinion poll. But Labour is in decline not because of its stance on Europe, but because of the uselessness and extremism of Corbyn’s neo-Marxist leadership.In fact, by alienating Labour’s voters in the predominantly pro-Leave heartlands of the North and the Midlands, Corbyn’s decision is likely to backfire disastrously.It is estimated that more than four million people who backed Brexit in the  referendum voted Labour in the  General Election. Just as importantly, around  per cent of all Labour constituencies had majorities for Leave in the referendum. In fact, many of the most fervent pro-Brexit seats in  are Labour-held — places such as Ruth Smeeth’s Stoke-on-Trent North, Gloria De Piero’s Ashfield in Nottingham and Melanie Onn’s Great Grimsby, all where virtually  per cent supported Leave.All these seats, and scores of others with slim Labour majorities, will be at risk due to Corbyn’s new policy. Nor will there be any chance of Labour winning any pro-Leave Tory marginals, which are necessary for a Commons majority.The dangers were highlighted in May’s European elections, where Nigel Farage’s Brexit party beat Labour in a string of traditional heartland seats including Hartlepool, Redcar and Bolsover.As the Labour Brexit campaigner Brendan Chilton put it recently: “A pro-Remain policy would be an electoral disaster for the Labour Party on an unprecedented scale. If this were to happen, Labour may never recover.”Well, it has happened. But the sense of betrayal goes far deeper than electoral calculations. This week Labour has dramatically shown where its priorities lie — not with the traditional working class, but with the sneering elitists of the affluent, pro-EU middle class.Tragically, this once proud movement has become a pale imitation of the Liberal Democrats in all their EU worship and disdain for national pride. Instead of embracing its industrial communities, Labour has retreated into its metropolitan enclaves.And this twist has thrown up a bizarre reversal of roles — Corbyn, the eternal rebel, is now the pathetic stooge of the pro-EU establishment, while Boris Johnson, the likely Tory victor, is the real warrior for British justice and liberty. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So why risk losing the already fragile goodwill of the public by treating them asthey’re tiresome selfie-hunters  It’s like those celebrities who put a “no photos” hand up when you haven’t even got your camera out.Or the ones who tell journalists the most anodyne fact about themselves, then add: “But don’t quote me on that.” As .It reminds me of the time when I found myself as a “plus one” at the wedding of a Z-list celebrity who had flogged his nuptials to Hello! magazine.Post-ceremony, the guests were left hanging around as the happy couple did their contracted, painfully proooootracted photoshoot, so I sauntered off to the shade of the nearest tree to make a phone call. Within seconds, the groom appeared at my side and hissed: “If you’re filing copy on this, I will have you removed.”I was simply calling home to say goodnight to my five-year-old. Harry and Meghan’s disproportionate defensiveness over their son’s christening smacks of a similar celebrity narcissism.The reality, one fears, is that this whole “privacy please” charade is yet another example where the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are blurring the lines between “royal” and “celebrity”. Being the latter means you pay for everything yourself.But being royal means you have -hour police protection funded by us, transport and living expenses funded by us, a £.million refurbishment of your house funded by us and your child is deemed important enough to be baptised by the Archbishop of Canterbury.And inyou perform the occasional public duty and follow the royal traditions that have sustained the Monarchy for hundreds of years.One of those traditions being the inclusion of godparent names in the royal register. So omitting them from the official court circularis bordering on the non-constitutional.And when the tourist magnet of tradition, pomp and ceremony is pretty much all the Royal Family has left as a bargaining chip with the already hard-pressed taxpayers who fund them, that’s a bold, some might say reckless, move.A recent poll asked, “do the Sussexes have the right to keep godparents’ names secret”, and  per cent said “yes”,  per cent “no”, and  per cent “don’t know”.Don’t know, or don’t care  And therein lies the rub.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate. In a really grim kind of way.GRIM viewing, wasn’t it  That leadership debate.Smirky Hunt trying to convince everyone he has charisma and stands a chance of winning. And our next Prime Minister, Bozo, incapable of giving a straight answer to anything.Can you imagine asking Boris the time “Well, ha ha, I think that’s a very interesting question. And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone. Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders. You can read about how Brexit was betrayed in my new book, The Great Betrayal, out next week.It’s a sorry story and it should make you angry. Mind you, it’s also quite funny,you have a warped sense of humour.THIS is Geronimo the alpaca.

But nine out of ten of Britain’s .million veterans don’t know about it.So The Sun has teamed up with the Ministry of Defence-backed ­initiative as part of our vital Never Forget Them campaign.We want all veterans to get a better deal when shopping or paying for services — including meals out, travel and even holidays — not just the , who have signed up.And we are calling on more businesses — of any size — to swell the ranks of the , firms offering money off.It comes after The Sun this week demanded our next Prime Minister back our three-part Veterans’ Pledge:Julia Cooper, , landlady of The Don bar, a hub for many veterans, in Stockton-on-Tees, Co Durham, said: “I can’t thank The Sun enough for standing up for former servicemen and women.“Many of the men who come here served in Northern Ireland and they live in fear of being arrested and charged for serving their country.”Key to the Defence Discount Service scheme is the Defence Privilege Card, which veterans can use in stores and at businesses large and small and get up to a third off. Discounts can be found online and via an app.George Rogerson, , who served seven years in the Gloucestershire Regiment, including three tours in Northern Ireland, hailed the scheme as “a recognition of service to the country”.The former Lance Corporal, who was mentioned in dispatches after saving the le of his wounded­ commander under sniper fire in Belfast, has used the discount card since .George, from Chirk, Clwyd, said: “Veterans like me did our bit for your country and I use my card virtually every week and save money. I don’t regard it as charity.When I show my card and get discount, it’s like a recognition of my service to the country and a ‘thank you’. I’ve lost count of the hundreds of pounds I have saved over the years.”Another veteran saved £ on his phone alone from EE. Yet virtually none of the veterans The Sun spoke to yesterday in The Don had heard of the scheme.Among them was Pete Gaines, , of Sedgefield, who served  years with the Royal Artillery. Pete, who has not worked since a heart attack at , vowed: “I am going to sign up and save myself money.”Or visit Google Play or the Apple App Store and download the Defence Discount Service app.The app allows members to search for discounts in their local area as well as browse discounts on the move.It is FREE to join butyou want the Defence Privilege card, which you can carry in your wallet, there is an admin fee of £., which lasts for five years.Tony Walls, , from Thornaby on Tees, was another in The Don keen to join in.An ex Corporal who served  years with the Pioneer Corps, leaving in , he thought the scheme was only for those still serving.He said: “I had heard of this scheme but I didn’t think it was for me. I am certainly going to check it out.”The scheme means veterans and serving Armed Forces can enjoy discounts ranging from ten per cent off to, in some cases,  per cent discount on thousands of everyday items.It is not just giants such as Starbucks, National Express, Jet holidays, Enterprise Rent A Car, Halfords and KFC that take part. Thousands of small businesses are also on the list of , firms — such as bridal shop Willoughby  Wolf, in Marlborough, Wilts.Victoria and Spencer Wolf only opened the shop last September but signed up to the DDS scheme because former Warrant Officer Spencer, , serv­ed  years in the Royal Signals.Victoria, , said: “We benefitted from the scheme with discounts on things like cinema tickets and when we became business owners we wanted to pass that benefit on to other veterans.”Already they have given discounts totalling around £ to serving soldiers or former servicemen and women.Victoria added: “The first thing I ask our brides-to-be is do they have a brother, husband, father or close ­relative who has served or is serving  I point them in the right direction. Spencer spent over  years serving this country. Being able to pass on some benefit is really important to us.”The Sun is urging more companies to sign up. And the message is already getting through.Last night food giant Iceland confirmed it is considering giving discounts to veterans.And Cadbury World in Birmingham said it offers a  per cent discount for the military, who can bring up to six people with them on a booking. They just need a form of military ID or be a member of the Defence Discount Service.We will pass them to the Defence Discount Service so your firm can help those who served and boost your business by gaining loyal new customers.The more companies that get involved the more we can help our ­veterans.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Their action was very silly and they will certainly regret it. Our reciprocal action will be announced.Confirming the Montrose standoff yesterday, a Government spokesperson urged Iran to de-escalate the situation in the region. The Government spokesman said: Contrary to international law, three Iranian vessels attempted to impede the passage of a commercial vessel, British Heritage, through the Strait of Hormuz.HMS Montrose was forced to position herself between the Iranian vessels and British Heritage and issue verbal warnings to the Iranian vessels, which then turned away.We are concerned by this action and continue to urge the Iranian authorities to de-escalate the situation in the region.Iran later accused weak Britain of lying about the incident in a bid to inflame tensions in the region.Tehrans foreign minister Mohammad Jawad Zar appeared to deny the Islamic Republics boats were being confrontational.He said: They make a claim to create a tension that these claims are not worthwhile, and raised many claims.Mr Zar also said England was attempting to cover their weaknesswhile blasting America for engaging in economic terrorism referring to the sanctions imposed on Tehran by Washington.Initial reports from the US said that five Iranian vessels had harassed the tanker.Responding to the reports, US Central Command spokesman Cpt Bill Urban said: Threats to international freedom of navigation require an international solution.The world economy depends on the free flow of commerce, and it is incumbent on all nations to protect and preserve this linchpin of global prosperity.UK defence officials have previously confirmed that the Montrose had been deployed to the region to perform a maritime security role.A spokesman for Theresa May said the Prime Minister is concerned about the incident in the Gulf and called for a deescalation.The British Heritage ship - operated by BP - earlier made an “abrupt” u-turn and ed to the safety of Saudi Arabia’s coastline on Sunday.It had been heading to Iraq’s Basrah terminal when satellite trackers showed it changing course.Tensions continue to rise between Iran and the West after the Islamic Republic last week announced it was upping its uranium enrichment programme.Tehran plans to increase its production beyond the limits imposed by the  Iran Nuclear Deal - which the US walked away from earlier this year.US President Donald Trump said the deal had been too soft - but it was still supported by other western backers including the UK.Following Irans announcement, Trump vowed on Wednesday that sanctions on Iran would soon be increased, substantially!Last month, President Trump called off a planned airstrike on Iranian military targets at the last minute in retaliation for the shooting down of an unmanned US drone.Iran had earlier been blamed for a series of devastating sea mine attacks on US-linked oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz."},{"url":null,"title":"four bed house incredible secret bar inside","story":"The £k property in trendy Hackney comes with a private garden and a bespoke fitted kitchen -

A text I got even said: “I’m the MP, you don’t get to tell me what to do.” And I was bombarded with rude messagesI left work too early.I was sent halfway across London to sort out an issue with their travel documents.Another time I was scolded for bringing the wrong shoes to a meeting.They once screamed at me because I hadn’t spotted something silly someone had put online about them and got it deleted within minutes.One thing that was particularly toxic was that staff members were pitted against each other - they would tell me they were about to fire my colleagues, or tell my colleagues they were about to fire me.They fabricated stories about us and told them to other people in the team - just to sow discord among us.Whenever someone left the room they would speak loudly about their ability, their looks, their weight. They would snarl, slam doors, give you dirty looks, tut, roll their eyes.But the irony was - they knew how to turn on the charm when they needed it, which made you doubt it all. They would buy us presents sometimes and compliment us.Even though they were so vile, the more awful they were to me, the more I wanted to try and impress them, and prove them wrong. You never knew when they would turn - that was scary.Only by naming and shaming will we see repercussions for bullying and harassment in Parliament - but I still don’t feel comfortable doing that.That could only comewe had a culture of openly talking about our experiences without the victims fearing they would lose their professional standing.I would still feel reluctant to name the MP who bullied me publicly, evenI stayed anonymous - I fear it would come back to me.It makes me so angry that despite reports like this, there will be MPs who will get away scot free, because no one knows who they are apart from the people involved.Offering training courses isn’t enough, especially when they aren’t mandatory. The MPs who have gone on that training are the MPs who least need it.There needs to be policies put in place to protect staff from being bullied and harassed in Parliament.Each MP can run their office as and how they see fit at the moment, it’s so poorly regulated.There should be really serious repercussions for MPs found to be bullying or harassing staff. Whether that’s being suspended, having the whip removed, or limiting their ability to employ staff until they understand how to treat staff and not bully and harass them.After I left, I spent a lot of time thinking maybe it’s just me and I am clearly so bad at my job anybody would have that reaction.This report has vindicated that I have been bullied and there is a systematic problem here.But it’s incredibly distressing to read it back, it brought it back what I and my colleagues had gone through.I do still struggle with confidence in the workplace even now, years on.And the MPs today who are blathering on about the report on Twitter, who are beating their chests and saying how dreadful it all is You can almost guarantee they are doing some bullying themselves.

So when it came to applying for disability benefit, they struggled in a world of websites and online forms. That was when Nick Leaman came to the rescue. The advisor with Bristol-based financial education charity Talking Money came to their house, and took care of everything. “Nick is a hero to us,” says Emlyn, . “He comes over and immediately puts you at ease. He knows exactly what to say and is so knowledgeable. “I am from the old school, and to understand something I need it in my hand. I don’t even know how to switch a computer on. But everything is online these days. I can’t even print out a form.  We are just relieved that Nick came over and explained everything to us and help us out.” Nick’s help was invaluable for the couple, who are both disabled and struggle to get out, and were falling behind on their rent. Nick’s work with Talking Money involves helping people who find themselves victims of fraud or who may be struggling with debts and don’t know where to turn. And the financially qualied advisor helps people access the benefits they are entitled to, with free specialist advice and ongoing support when they need it most. Over the last year the charity has received more than , enquiries and helped more than , people with advice and casework.They have also secured £.m for vulnerable low-income households by identying and applying for additional benefits they’re entitled to, including appealing negative decisions around housing benefit, sickness and disability benefits and Universal Credit .The majority of Nick’s work is through face to face consultations in Bristol and the surrounding area.  And he says many of his older clients struggle with the internet. “Older people are missing out because they can’t navigate online. I do feel compassion for them. They suffer from a lack of knowledge and access to information. Many of the best deals are online too so they miss out in that way too.” But the majority of people Nick helps are of working age. “It used to be the case that they had racked up huge credit card debts. But it has changed. The issues are now that they are struggling to pay rent and utility bills because they just don’t have the funds. Often they are in work, but they don’t get given enough hours or just not being paid enough. Or it might be the case they are facing financial crises because of unexpected le changes, such as relationship break-up, redundancy and bereavement. “It is also scary how much fraud is out there and how many people get scammed. Fraudsters are getting increasingly confident and can be so convincing. I had one lady who received a text saying she owed thousands to HMRC. It was a con, but she almost fell for it and was going to pay even though she was barely able to afford her rent. The problem is thatyou are desperate you are more likely to fall for scams like this because you just don’t think sensibly.” Despite the enormous demand on him, Nick loves his work. “It can be stressful but it is also really fulfilling because you are here to help people.  Evenyou can improve their lives just a little, that can make a huge dference to them.

Donna Bettiss, , was devastated after James Routledge, , suddenly ended things last month after a seven-year relationship . Sheaposs now listed her £, Sophia Tolli aposMonteapos sleeveless tulle and sequin gown on Facebook for £ as it remains a constant reminder of what had happened.Their pal Paige Hannington, , had offered wedding advice over cocktails after she tied the knot some months before. But during a work trip recently, James and Paige drunkenly confessed they both werenapost happy in their relationships. James called off his wedding and began dating Paige weeks later.    Donna, from Horsham, West Sussex, said: I really liked Paige, she helped me so much [with the wedding] so I feel completely betrayed. I was distraught that someone I knew and trusted and was discussing such an important time in my le with, could do that to me. However the way I feel now is very paranoid to discuss how amazing my relationship is with any other woman. She totally destroyed my confidence. When James decided she was who he wanted there was nothing I could do but let him go. I didnapost cause them any problems or try to stop them progressing. I even saw them on a night out but I just left them to it. I wasnapost going to make their night out with their friends awkward so I kept my distance and kept my friends away from saying anything to them.  The day I let James go was the day I realised he no longer loved me and I couldnapost force someone to love me or stay with me, that would be selfish. “The dress has been at my uncle’s house until recently, but now it’s hanging in my wardrobe. “I can’t keep it, there are too many bad memories. I desperately need it goneI want to move forward and rebuild my le. “Having it hanging there is a constant reminder of what happened. “I originally listed it for £, on eBay but there was no interest in the dress, so then I listed it for £ on Facebook and wrote what my partner had done. “Since I wrote that I’ve received lots of positive messages.”  The advert reads: “Open to offers, never worn. Wedding was cancelled due to [redacted] fiancé. “Desperately need gone, cost me £, had it a year and it’s a constant reminder. “Sophia Tolli dress size  never altered.” Donna and James met in March  at a nightclub in Horsham, West Sussex, and the following day Donna searched for him on social media and sent him a message. Six months later loved-up Donna moved in with James who then proposed and presented her with a diamond cluster engagement ring. Donna said: “I instantly fell for him and we soon spent every single day together. After a couple of months he told me how in love with me he was. “We were both really, really happy and so madly in love - head over heels - I wanted to spend the rest of my le with him.”  The pair were happily engaged and bought a two-bed end-of-terrace house where they lived together with Donna’s cat Sammie. Bride-to-be Donna excitedly booked four-star Nutfield Priory in Redhill, Surrey, as the April  wedding venue and picked her dream wedding gown, bridesmaid dresses and busied herself making hand-crafted decorations. As Donna immersed herself in wedding planning, newly-married Paige regularly offered her wedding planning advice over cocktails. Donna said: “The whole time from June up until November was wedding planning. “Paige and I would meet up for a cocktail and she would give me stuff for my wedding. “She even gave me her spreadsheets which were a massive help. “We also did a lot of over text and Facebook and she would tag me in dferent things. In September Donna picked up her designer wedding dress and said the gown, which hugged her curves, made her feel like royalty. Donna said: “When I went to pick up the dress with my mum and tried it on I said ‘mum I feel like a princess’. “I felt so pretty and elegant and it struck me that I really was getting married and wanted to spend the rest of my le with him. “Mum was crying and other people in the shop were welling up too.”  However two months later, in November , Donna was stunned when James delivered the bombshell news that he didn’t love her anymore and the wedding was off. Donna said: “When he told me he didn’t love me anymore and that we weren’t going ahead with the wedding I was broken. “I collapsed to the floor and cried my eyes out. “I went for a walk to get away from the house to process what had happened - the James I had loved had gone. “When I came back to the house, he told me there was nothing to talk about. I had no option but to leave. “I rang a friend who told me to pack a bag and go to her house straight away. I was up all night crying my eyes out. Devastated Donna fled to her friend’s house as she processed what happened. Donna said: I didnapost go to work, I didn’t eat, sleep or talk. I didn’t do anything. My friend said she’d never seen anything like it. “I just went completely numb and sat in the same spot for four days.” Newly-single Donna eventually moved back in with her parents and lost three stone in weight due to the stress of the break up and not eating properly. Since the break-up Donna has slowly started to rebuild her le and met her current partner -year-old data analyst Nick Pashley four months ago. Donna said: “Last October I started to rebuild my le - I changed job and have been focusing on my wellbeing. “I met someone new on Bumble called Nick - he’s my rock. “If Nick was to say ‘let’s get married’ I don’t think I could go through it again as the experience has turned me into a commitment-phobe. “I’ve only just got my dress back as it’s been hanging up at my uncle’s house. “Now it’s in my wardrobe, the fact I know it’s here, I need it gone so I can move forward. It was really expensive but there are too many bad memories attached to it. “I put it up for sale on eBay but had no interest, since sharing it on Facebook I’ve had lots of people sending me positive messages of support, which has been nice.” Donna has yet to sell the dress but hopes a bargain-hunting bride will get the chance to enjoy the dress on her special day. Donna said: “It’s a really beautul dress and will make someone’s day. “The a-line dress draws you in at the waist and then it flares out and covers everything up, it makes you look like you have the tiniest waist.” James said: I paid for pretty much everything for the wedding. Donna paid for some small craft items to make personalised champagne flutes, but I paid for the big stuff. “Her dad contributed £ towards it but was reimbursed once the wedding was called off. Paige, a photographer, said: “Donna has never attempted to contact me to try to have it out. “It would be hard to hear that James and I are incredibly happy. “We’re in a fantastic situation and I’m aware Donna is in a new relationship. I personally wish her happiness. I was married to another person. I worked with James and we had been friends for three years and we went away, with other people, on a work trip and we got chatting.

A major advocate for helping children access outdoor space to improve their development, Kate told how “nature can play a pivotal role in helping children grow up to become happy, healthy adults”. The campaign ‘Backyard Nature’ - fronted by group of children from Anfield, Liverpool - will encourage and support children to spend a million hours outdoors to learn about their environment and take action to safeguard the planet. A new poll suggests that % of parents are concerned about future environmental challenges faced by their children, and the limited amount of time their children spend outdoors.    The Duchess said: “Spending time in nature can play a pivotal role in helping children grow up to become happy, healthy adults. “The great outdoors provides an open playground for children to have fun and learn le-long skills – from balance and coordination to empathy and creativity – with their friends, their parents, their carers, or their family members. “I hope the Backyard Nature campaign inspires children, families and communities to get outside and engage with nature, wherever they live.” Mum-of-three Kate, , was seen having fun on Wednesday supporting her husband William at a charity polo match against his brother Harry’s team.    The royal couple’s children, Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, four, and Prince Louis, one, all played together in the adjoining fields, even playing with their new cousin Archie, Harry and Meghan’s newborn son.Young people, and their parents or carers, can sign-up online to become “Backyard Nature s” for their area through the website backyardnature.orgOnce joined, users can find their local patch using a map highlighting green spaces, download DIY guides and also find conservation events happening nearby. The campaign, funded by the Iceland Foods Charitable Foundation, was inspired by the Eco Emeralds, a group of young environmentalists from All Saints Catholic Primary School in Anfield, Liverpool.   The youngsters aged seven to  contacted Iceland’s managing director Richard Walker via Twitter and were invited to the supermarket firm’s head office to present their ideas, leading to the development of the campaign.Mr Walker said: “The nation is waking up to the immediate challenge facing us - far bigger than any of the other issues being discussed in the media at the moment, the environmental crisis has huge implications for us all. “The Eco Emeralds share my belief that the next generation needs to connect with nature and become conservation activists, and their commitment to motivating and enabling others to do this is truly inspiring. “I strongly believe that children need to know nature in order to want to protect it, and this campaign is about supporting them to do just that.

And Mr Clinton, who was traveling with his young daughters, exclusively told : These people were clearly, clearly drunk but Ryanair were serving more alcohol.They were having shorts, vodka and tins of Heineken up to two hours into the flight.

We are very worried as we are ing to the UK this Saturday and the same people will also be ing. A young couple are also ing and the lady is six months pregnant - she could not leave her seat to go to the toilet for fear of the feral animals jostling around her, the father-of-two added. All around the departure gate, revellers were spilling alcoholic drinks, jumping over chairs, screaming, shouting and swearing. Despite all this, all passengers were allowed to board. The pre-flight safety briefing was impossible to be heard by me, my neighbouring passengers at the rear and also my daughters near the front.    Numerous warnings throughout the flight did not calm down the - feral revellers and the aircraft taxied. It should never have taken off. Then, it should have ed to Manchester. There were some arrests but there should have been  at least. The chemist, from north Wales, alleges Ryanair continued to serve booze on the flight - contrary to initial claims none was sold. He added: They were having a party in the aisles.  They were shouting, swearing and there were other passengers - young and old - stunned all around them. Iaposd never seen anything like it before. It was just something . Mr Clinton believes some members of the group were from Manchester and others were from Scotland. The dad continued: One of the loudest was one guy who was just shouting aposManchester, Manchesterapos down my ear all the time. Others were shouting that too so I guess some of them were from there.  This lady near me, who must have been between  and , looked terried. There was potential anger in these people. I was worried for my girls. We are meant to be on holiday but are truly terried. As for the vomiting, we could smell it. It was horric.

One wrote: Why canapost she hold the baby properly after two months  It looks weird. Clearly the nanny looks after him most of the time. Another added: She is clearly struggling and not yet familiar with the best way to hold a baby that is covered by a blanket. Her hand position is also awkwardly placed.But now several parenting experts have come to the defence of the Duchess of Sussex. Speaking to Today, Dr. Jen Trachtenberg a certied pediatrician, proclaimed Meghan was doing nothing wrong.   She said: There is no one right way to hold a baby. You want to make sure the baby is secure and thataposs exactly what Meghan was doing. Sheaposs holding him tightly with two arms. Heaposs not crying and heaposs not uncomfortable. Dr. David L.

Sophie Butler, , was embarrassed and felt guilty when the doctors told her as she, like most other people, has always associated it with the brave men and women who serve in the armed forces. However the anxiety condition can occur after any form of extremely frightening or distressing event. She nearly died and lost her daughter Sydney during her first birth, and suffered horrendous fourth-degree tears during her second. She was then told during her third pregnancy that she had a blood clot that could have been fatal. She had flashbacks to her time in hospital, combining all of the traumatic experiences into one horric memory.Speaking during the Birth Trauma Association aposs awareness week, Sophie has shared her horrying journey and how she finally broke down and got the help she desperately needed after six long years in the dark.   She told : I was questioning myself. I was a bit embarrassed. I felt like I was taking something away from Army veterans. I was like, I donapost deserve to be diagnosed with this. I havenapost fought in a war or witnessed the things they have. But I just felt so relieved that finally after six years everything made sense. It wasnapost my fault. It was out of my control. My counsellor compared it to a car accident. Iaposve realised that I can talk about it. I just thought, why have I been putting up with it for so long. Sophie, who works in TV, and her husband Sam, , are proud parents to Sydney, six, Sadie, two, and -month-old Sonny.    Each of the births was extremely dficult physically and emotionally, to the point that sheaposs referred to Manchesteraposs St Maryaposs Hospital as Scary Maryaposs up until just a few months ago. Sydney - September  When Sophieaposs waters broke she was told to stay at home until her contractions got closer together however she then noticed the water was becoming a brown, greeny colour so she went in. When she was examined the nurses told her she was only cm dilated by the baby had pooed inside of her. They both looked alarmed. I just remember my heart sinking. That was the first part of it. Thataposs when everything started to go wrong. I just remember going into the toilet and thinking this isnapost supposed to happen. She was then taken by ambulance to St Maryaposs hospital in Manchester.  When she arrived they thought it would still be a while so they told Sam to go and get food, but when he was good things started to move quickly. Despite being cm dilated and trying to push nothing was happening, and then a doctor realised the baby was breech and in distress. Sophie had to be rushed down to theatre. Everyone was looking at her as she was wheeled down the corridor and into theatre with everyone looking at her and finally given an epidural. I just remember seeing my dad standing in the corridor, he just looked so panicked. Iaposve never seen my dad look so scared. However Sydney didnapost cry at first and had to be rubbed very vigorously before she made a sound.  It was so strange. It was like an out of body experience. It felt like years until we heard her cry. It probably wasnapost that long but it felt like it. It just seemed so touch and go. When they gave her to me I couldnapost top looking at her and wonderingshe was okay. I felt really scared when she was in my arms, I thought I had lost her. I thought I was going to lose her again. I had my guard up I think. She spent two nights in hospital before ing home to start their lives as a family. While it was an exciting time, looking back now Sophie knows that she was depressed. But she put on a brave face and didnapost tell anyone how she was feeling. Sadie - July  Because of what happened with Sydney, Sophie didnapost want a cesarean when she was expecting her second child. I felt like I had been robbed of it. I was ready to push Sydney out but I couldnapost. She went into labour at a sports day and before long her contractions were very close together. However she was still only cm dilated . The pain was incredible. It was coming on really quickly, I couldnapost deal with it.    However there werenapost any beds free so she had to sit in the waiting room. She was given some painkillers that actually made her fall asleep and stopped the contractions. That was really bad. They needed to get the baby out. I just have a memory of my mum in the corner crying. She was in a state of confusion which meant she wouldnapost open her legs and the doctors had to hold her down to try and deliver the baby. The baby had her hands on her head which meant delivery was going to be even more dficult than normal anyway, and doctors had decided they needed to cut Sophie to get her out. I just remember seeing these scissors and thinking there is no way youaposre cutting me with them. I donapost know where it came from but I got the biggest push Iaposve ever done in my le. I had been pushing for so long I had nothing left, but I just saw the scissors and thought aposnoapos.  Little Sadie came out with the huge push, but Sophie suffered a huge rip right back to her bottom. She had fourth degree tears which meant that after a very quick cuddle with her baby she had to be taken into theatre. I was back in that room. I just thought how am I back here  I just remember lots of people. I had had enough and I just passed out, I couldnapost do it. The second traumatic birth brought back horrible memories of Sydneyaposs birth and she struggled to cope with the flashbacks.  If anyone asked me about the birth I couldnapost talk about it. I just tried to ignore it. I didnapost tell anyone. I was petried of anyone going down there. My mood swings were really up and down, I just tried to ignore it. I didnapost want any reminders of it. Sonny -  In November when she was about five months pregnant, Sophie developed a cough and before long was coughing up blood. Doctors thought she had norovisus. Iaposve never felt as bad as I felt. On Christmas Day I was crying because I felt so poorly. On Boxing Day they went to a walk in centre where she was given antibiotics but it carried on, and shortly afterwards she coughed so badly that something popped in her back. I thought I had broken a rib from coughing so hard. I couldnapost move.  She was taken to hospital by ambulance but it was so busy that she had to wait on a stretcher for  hours until a bed became free. She claims she was given little information by the hospital, but was finally told she had a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot on her lung. She was sent for lots of tests and scans which left her feeling really nauseous and she was vomiting. They just said youaposve got a blood clot and it can be fatal. Just matter of fact. It was awful. I still find that really dficult to think about. Iaposve got my two girls, I couldnapost die and leave them. She was given drugs to thin the blood which started to work, but they made her birth with Sonny even more dangerous and she opted for a cesarean to reduce the risks. Thankfully his arrival into the world was straightforward and they were delighted to have a little boy to add to their family.  But in the weeks after he was born Sophie started to feel really down. After I had Sonny I felt really angry, like why did I have to go through all of that  I felt like I had a really short straw. A lot of my friends are having babies and they just seemed to push them out and have a great time and I didnapost. I was bitter as well, I didnapost want to be but I just was.

Researchers who carried out a detailed study also found knowing a new episode of your favourite show is online and cruising through green traffic lights on the drive to the office are likely to make our day. Lugging a basket of shopping to the till and finding no queue, bumping into a friend out of the blue and giving money to charity also made the list. And despite the benefits of modern technology, nothing beats the good old days as we all still get a thrill from receiving a letter or card in the post. The study of , adults was commissioned to launch BPmeaposs new rewards loyalty programme.    The scheme gives customers the chance to enjoy the ‘feel good factor’, with points earned on fuel and shop purchases - and redeemable from as little as £. Samantha Clarke, happiness consultant, aposchangemakerapos and spokesperson for BPme, said: “BP’s Feel Good Index shows that it is the little things that go a long way to boosting our wellbeing and mindset. “In a world where we are becoming increasingly isolated with technology, the Feel Good Index shows that small moments and human interaction help to boost our happiness and can make everyday a little better. “Happiness isn’t derived from ‘things’ and money, but through those light touches of connection such as giving or receiving compliments, smiling or holding the door open for someone. “There’s always a ripple effect to making every day brighter, so a small win for staff or a customer can then ripple out to those around you. Some of leaposs more simple pleasures also featured on the list, such as indulging in a chocolate bar, the sound of birds chirping and turning up the volume to a song which takes you back. The aposFeel Good Indexapos also includes having a cup of tea made for you and showing off a new outfit. The research, conducted by OnePoll, found the sun poking its head out of the clouds, enjoying a delicious treat and patting a pooch are often the cause of these spells of sudden joy.    The research also found nearly a third said Friday is the best day of the working week, so it comes as no surprise a glass of wine or beer after a long day also featured on the list. As a result, one fth of Brits hit ‘peak’ happiness on Friday, with nearly halfexperiencing that ‘Friday feeling’. And regardless of what day of the week it is, the research also found Britsapos mood is at its peak between pm and pm every day.  But these peaks and troughs come to us frequently, and by am on a weekend Brits reach the same ‘level’ of happiness as they do at pm on a weekday. It also emerged during a typical weekday adults up and down the country hit a ‘dip’ in mood at am, as the morning alarm chimes to signal another day. These early starts leave a nation of sleepy heads, as half of Brits admitted they are often too tired to be in their best mood.

His departure became inevitable after Boris Johnson threw him under Donald Trump’s presidential limo. When a foreign leader belittles your PM and starts dictating who serves as your ambassador, you stand up to them. Mr Johnson shamed the nation with his craven response. Sir Kim was a pawn in a much bigger game. He was targeted as he was viewed by Brexiteers as sympathetic to the EU and an obstacle to a more slavish ambassador in Washington.  In their desperation to secure a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, the Brexiteers destroyed the career of a most respected diplomat and humiliated the UK on the world stage. They have dragged us away from Europe and want to place us at the mercy of a president who should be served with an ASBO. The next humiliation would be a trade deal that lets US firms export their chlorinated chicken and batter down the doors of our NHS. So much for seizing back control. Pension scam Thousands of women have been penalised by the change in the retirement age. Now they are being punished yet again for taking time out of work to raise a family or look after an elderly relative. A report says women have £, less in pension pots than men.  The shortfall is compounded by the fact they often earn less than their male counterparts and are more likely to be in part-time jobs. Auto-enrolment is helping bridge the gap, but more must be done to help women remain in work. That means providing better childcare and social care.

Liz Travis, , was on holiday in Halkidiki with her family when they got caught up in the extreme weather in Greece which has seen six people killed and more than  injured. The grandma described her family crouching on the floor of a taxi with their heads down, guarding her two year-old grandson as the storm lashed outside. She described fearing the car would turn over as it rocked, with tree branches hitting the vehicle on their way back to Halkidiki after visiting a nearby village. Liz said they were shaking, thought they would die, and said she began praying in fear despite not being religious. The sales negotiator from Bishopstoke claims they even saw a car appearing to slip over the edge of a clf and admitted she woke up from a nightmare this morning following the traumatic scenes they saw. Have you been caught up in the storms in Greece  Email webnews@mirror    Speaking to Mirror, Liz said: We thought we were going to die, it was horrendous. Iaposm not even religious but I started praying. I was doing cross signals across my chest. She added: We saw a power cable come down on the motorway. We saw a car slip over the edge of a clf, we just canapost believe it. The Greeks said theyaposve never experienced anything like it. I woke up this morning having had a nightmare and shouted aposget the car off the clfapos. I have been traumatised.  Liz and her family went on an evening excursion to nearby village Afytos, about  minutes from their hotel. As there were seven of them, they had arranged for two taxis to pick them up at pm last night. Liz was in the car with her husband James Travis, , her -year-old daughter Sian Yates and grandson Finley Yates, two. In the taxi behind were Sianaposs husband Jamie Yates and his parents. As soon as they got in the cars, thunder and lightening hit and all the lights went out in Afytos amid a power cut. Within two minutes on the road, golf ball size hail stones began falling and the taxi driver desperately searched for a safe space to hide.  Liz told: The taxi driver said aposIaposve got to pull over, there are stones coming out of the skyapos. She said aposIaposve got to find a safe place to parkapos. In minutes there were golf balls of hell coming out of the sky hitting the car. We couldnapost see where we were going, cars were putting their hazards on. We were only going a few miles per hour as the taxi driver couldnapost see, she was crawling. We found a driveway and pulled into it - five minutes into the journey. The gates were swinging back and forth. The car was rocking and we thought we were going to turn over. Tree branches were hitting us, we could hear the sound of the water gushing. When they stopped in a driveway, Liz said they all sheltered on the floor of the car. She told: We were all crouching on the floor of the car. We got Finley out of his car seat and positioned him between me and my daughter and we were guarding him. Finley thought it was a game. We were all shaking. We all had our heads down incase the windows smashed. Water was leaking through the roof of the other taxi. We couldnapost see the other taxi behind but the taxi driver rang through to the other driver so we could speak to them.  The family were on the driveway for about half an hour before they slowly made their way back to the hotel when the hail stopped. At the hotel they were wrapped in towels by kind hotel staff who looked after them as they were shaking and shocked, but luckily all the family members made it back safely. Describing the aftermath, Liz said the metal poles on umbrellas by the pool were bent in half, gazebos were blown over on the beach. Another holidaymaker, Bethany Cooper, was also affected by the storm in Halkidiki. She told : We were sat on a beach front restaurant in Hanioti when it all happened.  She said it was very sudden, adding we currently have no electricity or water in the hotel.  Bethany said: We were eating at a restaurant on the beach front, and the power went off which we thought nothing of and everything was calm.Suddenly, a storm hit and there were chairs and items from the tables flying around.Everyone ran to get inside.could hear people screaming and children crying - and people were trying to barricade the doors closed.Today we cannot get any power or running water.

It was just bittersweet with the way it ended with relegation.“But it’s weird because going to Dundee was a good and bad experience for me.“It was good because I was playing regularly and I think it rounded off my football education and has made me stronger coming back to Aberdeen.“But it was bad because unfortunately Dundee were relegated.“Before the move we spoke about going away and playing regularly.“I went to Dundee and did that and I was part of the team. We were all pulling in the same direction trying to keep the club up.“Unfortunately we just weren’t able to do that.“From being at Dundee I’m used to playing more games and coming back here there’s a dferent kind of pressure. You’re expected to win every week and be at the top of the table.“At Dundee it was a relegation fight, but the games were just as important in terms of trying to stay in the league.“I think I’ve come back a better player with more experience and I’m hungry and ready to go.“If I’m picked hopefully I can force my way back into the team and keep myself in the team. The most important thing for me is trying to nail down a spot in the team and make it my own.“The pressure on us here is what you want as a footballer. It’s a case of channelling it in the right way to get results.”Tonight’s game will be the start of Aberdeen’s sixth straight European campaign under gaffer McInnes.In the previous five the Dons have fallen at the third qualying round stage on four occasions and the second qualying round last year.The Reds’ target once again in the Europa League is to reach the group stages.To achieve that they will have to come through four qualying ties.It’s a tall order, but Wright hopes this evening’s opener against RoPS can be the start of the journey to the groups and added: “We have to aim for the group stages and just take it game by game and tie by tie to try to get there.“Our focus is on RoPS and we’ll take it from there.“We know that they like to play a bit, but hopefully we can have the majority of the ball at Pittodrie and get on top of them and get after them.“The onus is on us to get forward because we’re playing in front of our fans and that’s something we’re looking forward to.”With a potentially challenging trip to Lapland awaiting the Dons next week Wright believes it is import to take a lead into the second leg.He said: “We recognise it will be dficult going over to Finland with the plastic pitch and the conditions.“Realistically we would love to get a win at home, but we won’t panicwe don’t.“We know the onus is on us to attack, but realistically it’s important we keep a clean sheet – that is perhaps the most important thing for us.“If we keep a clean sheet it gives us a  because the tie is over two legs.“We’ve been in Europe for a few years now so we’re experienced and know what we need to do.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.41873089-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.41873089-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.41873089-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/07/2.41873089-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"mcinnes and docherty agree new dons deals","story":"Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes and assistant Tony Docherty have agreed new contracts to keep them at Pittodrie until .The pair joined the Dons in March  and have held the Reds to the League Cup in  as well as qualying for the Europa League six seasons in a row.Pittodrie chairman Stewart Milne said: “I think everyone recognises what Derek has achieved during his time at the club and I am delighted he has agreed to extend his time at Pittodrie, making him our longest serving manager since Sir Alex Ferguson.“The board and I strongly believe that with Derek leading this club we have a real  for further success, and I am confident the team he has rebuilt over the summer will continue to see us competing for trophies, keeping the pressure at the top of the league, and hopefully a strong run in Europe.“Derek also played a critical role in enabling us to secure consent for Kingsford and it will be a real milestone for the club to see him take his first training session in our first owned and dedicated training facility in our -year history.“I look forward to continuing our work together as we strive to deliver success for our great club.”McInnes added: “I am delighted we have been able to agree new contracts with the club.#The staff, players and I are committed to trying to deliver success and build upon all we have achieved in the past six years.“With the opening of our new training campus at Kingsford on the horizon I am excited about the prospect of training professionally in a modern facility, something which should be in keeping with the ambitious club we are.“It’s no secret that I love working for this club and I will strive to continue to try and create those special moments for our supporters.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"monsters and magic come to lochgilphead booksigning","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead#s Argyll Book Centre is holding a book signing with Lari Don.The Secret of the Kelpie author will be in the indie book shop on Saturday June  to read her new book to eager ears and talk to readers about their favourite folk tales and inventing monsters.After a quick break, Lari willto read excerpts from her spellbinding Spellchasers trilogy to inspire you to imagine magical adventures of your own and tell one of your favourite myths.Born in Chile, Lari Don was brought up in Scotland where she has worked in politics and for the BBC.

collaboration between the Westminster and Holyrood Governments and local authorities in the region.It is hoped that the investment will create more than , jobs within the Borderlands region.Infrastructure Secretary Michael Matheson said: ldquoI am delighted we have reached this important milestone in signing Heads of Terms for the Borderlands Deal.ldquoSuccessful delivery of the deal will create jobs, protect existing ones and extend the benefits of economic growth to even more communities across Scotland.ldquoAlongside the establishment of a new enterprise agency for the south of Scotland, and activities of the South of Scotland Economic Partnership, the Scottish Governmentrsquos pound million investment will deliver signicant and lasting benefits right across the region.A full cross border feasibility study in to bringing the Borders Railway to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle also forms part of the deal.Transport agencies either side of the Border will work on a cross-border study for the A corridor as well as exploring an integrated transport system.The package of investment will also include broadband and mobile signal investment designed to bring the region up to UK wide levels of connectivity and a Borderlands Energy Investment Company to generate cheaper energy for the region and help the Borderlands become the first carbon neutral region in the UK.A pound million Mountain Bike Innovation Centre in the Tweed Valley aims to establish a world-class destination for research, development and tourism around mountain biking.John Lamont, MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, said: ldquoThis is fantastic news for the Borders ndash this deal is packed full of projects which will boost the Borders economy.ldquoFor too long, the Border at Berwick has been viewed as this line which prevents collaboration.ldquoIt is great to see this deal ignoring this Border and looking at how the whole region can be better served, and the economy better supported.ldquoEvery penny of this pound million investment is set to benefit the whole Borderlands region by bringing in thousands of jobs, millions more visitors and improving connectivity.ldquoI am particularly pleased that the Borders Railway extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell

visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive

It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"homophobic-selkirk-man-ordered-to-pay-compensation-to-couple","story":"A LABOURER from Selkirk has admitted hurling homophobic abuse towards two men.Then a month later Andrew Gillie approached both and told themthey didnt drop charges he would kill them.The -year-old of Buccleuch Road, pleaded guilty at the towns sherf court to behaving in a threatening or abusive manner and making abusive and homophobic comments in Yarrow Terrace, Selkirk, on August .He also admitted a charge of threatening the two men in Bridge Street, Selkirk, on September .Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser said the first incident happened at .pm when the two men, who are in a relationship with each other, became aware of Gillie and a female standing on a pavement.Gillie made a homophobic comment about one of the men.Mr Fraser said: \"He is fed up being targeted about his sexuality and was alarmed at what had taken place.\"The fiscal said Gillie had been cautioned and charged over that but came across the two men at about .pm on September  when they were walking their dog.Mr Fraser said: \"He said you better drop the charges or I will kill you.

Apart from the cones on the street, we never had any issues with bad parking or disturbance from people attending the event.ldquoI could hear some music on the evenings but I liked the atmosphere and it certainly wasnrsquot a nuisance. We did attend the family ride on the Sunday, and while there was plenty of mud, I thought theyrsquod done a great job creating such a big event in its first year in Innerleithen.With the proposed plans to redevelop the old mill to create the Mountain Bike Innovation Centre, Tom added: ldquoI think its exciting times to be a resident in Innerleithen and I hope events like these continue to grow and do well here.ldquoI remember when Innerleithen was a poor cousin to Peebles and Glentress as an MTB and tourist destination, and I think itrsquos the hard work of local people who have brought Innerleithen to the fore. Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race.

We are all engaging more online, but the conversations are getting shorter and colder.ldquoThese conversations would be more positive and productivewe could host them in a social context.ldquoWhatrsquos needed is a lsquoFaceFaceBookrsquo where the digital world is used to increase the physical interaction.They have suggested that a large screen cover the back of the building behind the stage that could act as a cinema screen, a digital backdrop to a theatre show and a space for presentations and gaming competitions.Although it is only in the very early stages of planning, the concept was well received by the community council, with member Ferhan Ashiq saying that he was ldquovery impressed with the bold and innovative idea.The community council has the option to either lease or buy the Town Hall from East Lothian Council, and this decision has not been officially made yet but will be the next step that is taken, discussing a business plan and the terms of the transfer with the local authority.The approach is laid out in the strategy, which states that the community council will ldquoreview the best practice from where and arrange research visits to similar facilities.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : amIt#s the penultimate day of competition at the NatWest International Island Games in Gibraltar and Orkney#s athletes are again in action in a multitude of sports.

I anticipate resistance that they inevitably face, not only politically, but the spite and anger aimed at women’s general visbility, played out in online readers’ comments, social media posts, and antagonistic media framings that dfer remarkably little in their intent to shame and belittle. Headlines and captions can be subtly hostile from the off, drawing on words with gendered, demeaning stereotypes: cat fight, slapped down.Recently though a few particular stars have shown up their critics by pressing on regardless, refusing to linger at stumbling blocks of self-justication demanded of them. They know they won’t win over those holding retrograde views of women and so don’t even bother, instead publicly laughing them off and continuing. It’s a defiance that makes their detractors appear all the more irrelevant, and relies on media savvy and knowing their true audience is looking on.For all social media can focus the lens of hatred, it’s also where contemporary stars across sport, politics, and entertainment communicate with audiences directly, and the audience with one another. When the USA national women’s football team get a hard time from many quarters, their strategy in dealing with it is knowing others are taking inspiration. Like our team in Scotland rising to new prominence, these footballers have won many new fans nationwide. A strong contingent among that are the women and LGBT communities who see them winning and being defiant in the face of familiar attack on the world stage, and, crucially, having a good time while they’re at it. You can join the party or stay under the bridge shouting at women moving on by.: How artists can defeat the politics of hate – Laura Waddell: Donald Trump cleared  Don’t be so sure – Laura WaddellTimes may be slow to change in many quarters, but a palpable new buoyancy comes from the groundswell of support and celebration social media has made visible, cheering on successes but also that defiance itself. We share everything online, sometimes ill-advisedly, but small pockets also share experiences and feelings, building community. Seeing, for example, Megan Rapinoe celebrate after a goal collectively feels good not only for football fans but for the queer people and feminists among them who have grouped together in mutual admiration and recognition. Rapinoe celebrating with theatrical flair in her now trademark arms-wide pose, a visual ta-da, a bow without the bend, is also a win for self-expression and cultural acceptance, all the more so for doing it in spite of detractors and during Pride Month’s spirit of celebration and protest. The momentum of the Women’s World Cup has gathered speed like a cork popping, the potency of representation mixed in with the adrenaline of high-level sports. For decades, sports audiences and commentators have taken men who smash tennis racquets and scream at referees in their stride. Only during the Women’s World Cup can I remember public discussion, facilitated by media phone-ins, about whether the winners have expressed their delight too confidently, their arms spread too widely. If they can’t stop them, they’ll police their tone. Think pieces have sprung up like mushroom spores about whether celebrating visibly is arrogant. Career controversialists have lined up to stick the boot in. In short, the resistance is ancient: to women taking up too much space, expressing their bodies too freely, moving without shame, and being confident in themselves in public. If John Knox were alive today, he’d be on a sofa, gesticulating about Megan Rapinoe.It was inevitable the thin-skinned Trump would bristle at these women, representing many things his Administration opposes, and particularly Rapinoe, with her history of ‘taking the knee’ in protest during the American national anthem. After the President tweeted “Megan should WIN before she TALKS,” the team responded by criticising Trump’s exclusionary policies, racism, and homophobia. When a Fox team covering the World Cup final from a bar went live, patrons began chanting “F*** Trump”.As much as it has felt radical to see women’s sports celebrated in the mainstream worldwide, and for those sports stars to harness the moment as a protest, it has also felt radical to see women’s happiness on the big screens.Visual symbols matter, and few politicians have made use of them as well as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, known by her initials and Twitter handle AOC, with her innate understanding of digital media and intent to turn celebrity into action. She’s shown up, with remarkable ease, attempted smears on her character that however weak, might have caused a less digitally reactive politician to flounder. When a video of her dancing in college was dragged into the public eye, its youthful frivolity used in an attempt to damage serious credibility, she put it in its place with a short clip released on Twitter dancing outside her office. She’s also taken viewers on storytelling journeys while questioning in Congress. A five-minute video of her talking about corruption went viral, despite being full of official ins and outs, because she framed it as a “lightning round” game, playing the role of dodgy dealer trying to game the system in order to show up those who have.AOC’s ease on camera helps. But while there’s a long road ahead of her, and recent polling has shown she might need to invest more time in her constituency to retain support, Ocasio-Cortez’s savvy should serve her well. She’s used media attention to shine a light on political causes, knowing press who’ve snfed her out as a rising star will follow where she goes, whether laudatory or critical. Her recent trip to migrant camps on the US-Mexico border forces others to bear witness.Although we know from the meagre information released by human rights associations and charities that conditions are horric in these camps, now openly being referred to as concentration camps by AOC and others, the tide of public opinion has typically relied on visual prompts when it comes to human rights.Several years ago Amnesty International published a report into digital abuse and its impact on freedom of expression, marking it as a factor in dissuading women from speaking publicly. Hostility takes its toll and not everyone is equipped to rise above it. But the new wave of women stars who very visibly press on in spite of their critics is a strong and impactful message about ignoring, not placating, those stuck in the past, and doing it for each other.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Mr. Herbinson, a member of the th Royal Irish Rles Association paid tribute at the last resting place of his great uncle Sgt Robert Herbinson who was killed in action on August ,  in the Ypres Salient.Sgt. Herbinson had survived the slaughter of the first day on the Somme where he had performed gallantly under fire and subsequently moved with the remainder of the thDivision to the British sector in Belgium. The th RIR Association were on their annual pilgrimage to the WW battlefields, taking part in the July  ceremonies on the Somme before visiting other sites. Editor’s note: Robert Herbinson was born at Clonavon, Ballymena and is buried at Ration Farm Cemetery Annexe, Ploegsteert, Belgium and commemorated in Wellington Street Presbyterian Church. Ballymena Observer, September ,  - Miss Herbinson,  Hill Street, Ballymena, has been informed that her brother, Sergeant R. Herbison th Royal Irish Rleswas killed in action on Sunday, August th. Sergeant Herbinson was, prior to joining the colours, an employee in the Phoenix Weaving Factory, Ballymena.He was a member of the Ulster Volunteer Force and of Ballykeel LOL . His brother, Lance Corporal James Herbinson, Royal Irish Fusiliers, is serving at the front. A letter received from the Rev. A. Gibson, Chaplain to the Central Antrims, states that Sgt. Herbinson was killed while out on duty in no-mans land. He states:He was a most excellent soldier and a very good NCO and the regiment will miss him very much. He had done very fine work when the battalion went into action on st July and I have heard from his officers how nobly he did his duty that day. He was buried in a little cemetery near the firing line.Lt. W.B. Stuartwrote: Dear Miss Herbinson, I cannot tell you with what regret it is hat I am writing to tell you of the death of your brother. He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless. I was present at the funeral and he has been laid in a British cemetery just behind the firing line so there will be no dficulty in locating the grave after the war.

Indeed, and purely coincidentally, Ken left Uganda just before Amin’s reign of terror began.He was -years-old and looking after a region the size of Northern Ireland.He moved to Kenya and worked there for six years with Sir Alexander Gibb and Partner, a London based consultancy: “I was involved in the construction of hundreds of kilometres of roads.

I met Canon Noble Hamilton who took me under his wing.”Canon Hamilton encouraged Rev Quinn to go for ordination and the two became firm friends: “Probably because of our mutual love of rugby.” Of the other rectors at Seapatrick he also fondly remembered John Scott and his we Laura: “He was here about  years and we got on extremely well, we are lelong friends.”Having been commissioned as lay reader in , Rev Quinn was ordained as auxiliary minister at Sepatrick Parish in , one of the firstappointments to the new auxiliary role within the Church of Ireland.During his retirement sermon on Sunday he said he and his we loved Banbridge and had no intention of leaving the town.”He went on: “When one passes three score years and ten one tends to look back rather than forward.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast is uks sixth happiest city new research shows","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The country’s privacy laws are very strict on such personal information.Mrs Merkel, who turns  next week, also has kept up a full schedule lately, attending a Group of  summit in Japan and a marathon European Union summit. On Sunday, she is due to attend France’s annual national day military parade.At a news conference after Thursday’s meeting with Ms Frederiksen, Mrs Merkel sidestepped a German reporter’s question as to whether she has consulted her doctors and,so, what the results were.“You can assume that, firstly, I am aware of the responsibility of my office and act accordingly, also as far as my health is concerned,” she replied. “And secondly, you can assume that I also have a great personal interest in being healthy and taking care of my health.”Asked what her upcoming th birthday means to her, a smiling Mrs Merkel said that “it means you’re not getting younger, but perhaps more experienced. Everything has its good side”.All three incidents in which Mrs Merkel’s whole body shook in public took place as she stood still without talking, and ended immediately once she started walking. Mrs Merkel also has shown no signs of shaking or unsteadiness while standing and talking in parliament or, as at Thursday’s news conference, behind a lectern.The recent string of incidents has prompted some concern in German media — relatively mild by many other countries’ standards, but somewhat unusual for Germany — about Mrs Merkel’s health but is not dominating news coverage in the country.Fellow politicians of all stripes have largely steered clear of the matter or,they have addressed it at all, expressed support for Mrs Merkel’s handling of it.Simone Peter, a former leader of the opposition Greens, tweeted on Thursday of Mrs Merkel listening to the anthems in a chair: “That’s completely OK, and the Danish prime minister has the empathy and courtesy to show solidarity.”“Everyone should do that and recognise that a mega-stressful job can also leave its mark,” she added.Mrs Merkel, who has led Germany since November , said last year that she will not seek a fth term as chancellor and will not seek any other political job after her current term ends in .She gave up the leadership of her centre-right party after a pair of poor state election performances that followed a rocky start to her fourth-term government."},{"url":null,"title":"council bank holiday leisure centre opening arrangements","story":"Derry City and Strabane District Council have released details about opening arrangements at local authority owned leisure centres for tomorrows Bank Holiday .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshThey are as follows: Bishops Field Open Brandywell Closed Brooke Park Open City Baths Open Foyle Arena Closed Templemore Sports Complex Open Riversdale LC Closed Melvin SC Closed and Derg Valley Closed."},{"url":null,"title":"derry halloween royal mails stamp approval citys main carnival","story":"Royal Mail has given its ‘stamp of approval’ for Derry’s globally renowned Halloween Carnival by releasing a new stamp celebrating the annual event.The Derry based stamp was released last weekand is amongst eight highly colourful stamps released to capture the essence of well-known festivals and events across the UK.Many thousands of people take to Derry’s streets every October for the annual Halloween parade and fireworks display and to see the city’s famed walls come alive with ghouls, fire and musical performances.Last year’s festival, dubbed the Return of the Ancients, had a budget of almost £,.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhilip Parker, from Royal Mail, said: \"Communities throughout the UK have been coming together for centuries to share distinctive traditions and mark key dates of the year.\"These customs continue to evolve, and our new stamps celebrate their ersity and the communities that maintain them.\"There are an estimated . million stamp collectors and gt givers in the UK, according to Royal Mail."},{"url":null,"title":"operation motorman findings seamus bradley inquest made public next month","story":"The Inquest findings into one of the most controversial killings of the Troubles in Derry will be made public next month, the Derry News can reveal.Seamus Bradley was shot dead in highly disputed circumstances by the British Army during Operation Motorman in the early hours of July , .The Coroners Service for Northern Ireland has now confirmed that the findings of the Inquest will be announced by Judge Patrick Kinney on August  at Laganside Court in Belfast. The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news.

His cousin Christopher Hegarty was also struck in the head by a round fired by the same soldier but survived the shooting. Soldier B, the man responsible for both incidents will also face a charge of wounding with intent in relation to Christopher Hegarty.The decision to prosecute the soldier represented the reversal of a decision taken in  not to prefer charges against the former British serviceman. That decision was however overturned after a Divisional Court ruling last year.Previous decisions not to prosecute in the Hegarty case were taken in  after the original Inquest and again in  following a review of the case by the former Historical Enquiries Team.Announcing the decision in relation to the Hegarty case, Director of the PPS Stephen Herron said: “I have given careful consideration to all of the available evidence. This has included material obtained in the course of the initial investigation by a later investigation carried out by the Historical Enquiries Team material generated by Inquest proceedings and a number of forensic reports-the most recent of which was provided after the Court ruling in .“I have concluded that the evidence which can be presented at court is sufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of conviction and the Evidential Test for Prosecution is met.”Nine people also died in Claudy on July ,  as three car bombs tore through the heart of the County Derry village.CAPTION: -year-old Seamus Bradley who was killed by the British Army on July , . "},{"url":null,"title":"last call hunt champions businesses powys","story":"Powys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured is Cllr Rosemarie Harris .Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Pictured front left to right, Cllr Martin WealeCeri StephensBeverley Blt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsPowys Business Awards Launch Event  at County Hall, Llandrindod Wells last Tltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtuesday th June ltspan classtruncate-full-screengt..Picture by Phil Blagg..PB--.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsBiz awards logo\" Last chance to enter county’s premier business awardsITVrsquos Coast  Country TV presenter Andrew Price will be presenting thiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgts yearrsquos Powysltspan classtruncate-full-screengt Business Awards.lt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":"http://www.countytimes.co.uk/ource srcset=/resources/images/10119854.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"uknewsnational","story":"Get involved with the news in your community Send your stories and photos now  d  document.getElementsByClassName.style.display  blockLoading...Most popular         ,Promoted stories       Loading...Most popular Contact UsNewslettersNewsquest PrintingAdvertiseArchiveSite MapAnnouncementsLeapExchange and MartTerms  ConditionsPrivacy PolicyCookie PolicyManage ConsentTerms of AdvertisingContributor TermsDiversity StatementIpsoregulatedThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

He crossed the finish line in ., in sixth place overall, but first U-, a real eye-catching performance out of  finishersMeanwhile, Dee was not letting the side down as he again proved best in his age group, clocking yet another sub  time, his clocking of . was also good enough for overall seventh out of the  finishers.Ford kNewcastle was the venue for a nearer home race on Friday night and several East Down men and women took advantage of the opportunity to warm up for the action in Delamont the next day.Gordy Graham took third place overall in . a mere  seconds behind winner, Newcastlersquos David OrsquoFlaherty, while Catherine OrsquoConnor was second female in . to Gordyrsquos cousin, Laura Graham, who won in .. Paul Lloyd was st in . and Donal Smith placed th in  minutes on the button, out of a total of  runners.DelamontAs Van Morrison once said: ldquoMy momma told me therersquod be days like this,Thus was described East Downrsquos fantastic day out in Delamont on Saturday in the  X k relays, a new and exciting event organised by the Daye Brothers aka Atlas Running, which required teams of five runners each, with each one running a klap as the hot and hilly trails and paths around Delamont were described.At one point we thought we wouldnrsquot have enough runners to fill three teams so to get four teams of five representing East Down was pretty damn impressive.Some pretty impressive performances from the East Down gang as well with victories for the menrsquos A team and the mixed team and third in the all female team.Massive well done to all involved especially the team captain, Deirdre Weatherall who rallied the troops with carrots and sticks and a promise of ice creams, that did not materialise.All agreed that she did a fine job of getting  names in the hat and in the right place at the right time. It was great to see also that several relative newcomers to the club, Gillian and Gerard Grant, Donal Smith, Michael Morrissey and Alison Graham are happy to get involved with some of the older hands and the younger ones to enjoy the delights that a team relay can bring.Performances of the day have to be shared by Gavin Hynds whose third leg run for the EDAC male B team, which effectively hauled them up from last place to th.His time of . for the leg was only bettered by runners from the top two teams on the day, and by Neil Curran, the anchor leg runner for the EDAC A team.His final leg of . only put paid to the battling St Peterrsquos AC quintet during the final lap. The Lurgan team, which had held the lead from the start were understandably disappointed, but the EDAC squad deserved their win.Track and fieldOn to Sunday and it was our juvenile members who had to make the long journey to Tullamore in Co Offally to take part in the All Ireland T F Championships.Spread over two weekends, it therefore means that, for some, there are two journeys to the heart of Ireland on consecutive weekends.Thank you to all the parents for driving all these miles. Your efforts are greatly appreciated by everyone in the club and especially by the athletes themselvesNevertheless, it proved a great day at Tullamore at the first of three days of action with the sun shining for a nice change.East Down had four athletes taking part all in the m, but in two dferent age groups. In the U- race Anna Gardiner and Lucy Foster both ran in separate heats with both finishing in sixth position.The top three in each heat qualied automatically for the final later in the day along with the fastest two finishers outside the top six.Unfortunately, both EDAC girls missed out on qualication, but they ran super races with Lucy gaining a PB of .. and Anna running ...Lauren Madine and Kirsti Foster both competed in the U- race with both winning their heats and automatically qualying for the final later in the day.A last minute change of time table meant the final was brought forward by an hour so that meant quick warm-ups and back on the track was not the ideal preparation that would normally take place before an All-Ireland final.Nonetheless, the two girls put their minds to it and gave it their best shot. Having two out of eight from one club in an All-Ireland final is an achievement in itself.Kirsti came fourth overall in .., just missing a medal by tenths of a second. Lauren had to settle for seventh in . as she was hampered by ankle issues which had developed after her heat.Well done to all four for their efforts.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment. This is something I and many others are looking forward to..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Delight after new family walking trail opens at Saul  ","story":"A NEW walking trail for all the family to enjoy has been opened in Saul.The Saul Family Trail was officially opened last Wednesday by Newry Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Just under km in , the new route is at Saul GAC, which was behind the project.Club officials attended last weekrsquos launch and along with representatives of ious support organisations and members of the local community.Saul GAC is located at the foot of Slieve Patrick, a popular walking area for locals and tourists alike due to its beauty and historic interest.The current walking routes around the mountain are quite challenging and are not suitable for all levels of ability.The new trail is fully accessible to allow and encourage everyone to participate in outdoor activities.It offers Saul and Raholp a hub from which local people and visitors can enjoy the beauty of the local environment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we

district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

It’s was a great experience meeting Brian Cox as well, he was really interesting and good at making the topics exciting. I feel very lucky to have enjoyed this prize thanks to the MTF competition by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and can’t wait to see where my career will go.”Belfast bonfire organisers urged to leave leisure centre site Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadMet Office cancels N.I. thunderstorm weather warningThe  cheapest homes on sale in N.I. and how much they are going forN.I.

It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans.

It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”.
