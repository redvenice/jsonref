The sport is not just from strip clubs - it\u0027s also known as Chinese pole. \u0027The event was a fundraiser to help Team Scotland go to the championships. \u0027It\u0027s one of the fastest growing sports in the UK and they\u0027re hoping for it to become an Olympic sport. \u0027I told the Kennel Club this but I have had no response.\u0027 A Kennel Club spokesman confirmed Rebecca had been contacted about a \u0027regulation breach\u0027 but declined to comment further."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/10/4C77366600000578-0-image-a-34_1526807892331.jpg","title":"Meghan follow royal tradition having bridal bouquet placed tomb Westminster Abbey","story":"Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

The stunning leather interior of the car driven by the Duke of Sussex away from Windsor CastleIt was known in-house as ‘Project Dylan’, a nod to singer-song-writer Bob Dylan’s controversial switch in the mid 1960-s from acoustic to electric guitar when one traditionalist fan shouted ‘Judas.’But converting the classic E-Type means owners can ‘future proof’ their classic cars, says Jaguar. The original engine can even, if required, be swapped back.It can accelerate from rest to 62mph in 5.5 seconds – about a second faster than the original petrol version – with a top speed 150mph. However, with Prince Harry at the wheel he appeared to be taking things much more sensibly.The electric E-Type claims a ‘real world’ range of about 170 miles though that could increase to just over 200 miles. So there was little risk of running out of juice for the short hop between engagements at Windsor.It can be fully charged at home overnight in about six to seven hours with the fuel cap flap opening to reveal the electric charging point.          The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drive off from Windsor Castle in a fully electric version of Jaguar’s legendary E-Type sports car          Prince Harry took his new wife Meghan Markle out for a spin in a Jaguar that was hailed as \u0027the most beautiful electric car in the world\u0027If they had time to to avert their gaze from each other, the road ahead, and the cheering well-wishers, Harry and Meghan may have had time to admire how the original dashboard has been replaced with hi-tech carbon-fibre and the classic instruments given a digital revamp with hi-tech ‘virtual’ dials showing road speed and engine speed.But all other underpinnings, including brakes and suspension are the same, to ensure it still drives like the ‘original’ E-Type.The one-off electric E-Type would cost around £350,000 although Jaguar says prices could drop as more orders are received. But with its new royal connection, this one could now be priceless.Tim Hannig, director, Jaguar Land Rover Classic, said other models could follow: ‘Our aim with E-type Zero is to future-proof classic car ownership.’‘The Jaguar E-type Zero not only drives and looks like an E-type, it also offers outstanding performance. It’s quicker than an original E-type: 0-62mph takes only 5.5 sec, about one second quicker than a Series 1 E-type. But it is authentic to its DNA.’Jaguar said the restored Series 1.5 Roadster is’ totally original apart from its 21st century electric powertrain and modified instrumentation and facia. It also has LED headlights to save energy. The Zero’s lithium-ion battery pack has the same dimensions as the original XK six-cylinder petrol engine and sits in precisely the same place. The 220kW motor lies just behind the battery pack where the original gearbox used to be.          Under the bonnet: Jaguar have replaced the powerful petrol engine with a zero emissions electric motor and plug-in battery          The boot of the stunning Jaguar driven by the Duke of Sussex on Saturday after his weddingOne of Jaguar’s own restored ‘Reborn’ range – with a petrol engine - would be £280,000. Classic E-Types can cost from around £70,000, depending on condition. Back in the 1960s a new E-Type cost just a few thousand pounds.The electric E-Type Zero was one of three battery-powered cars that Jaguar showcased at its special ‘Tech Fest’ event in London last Autumn.Jaguar Land Rover chief executive officer Dr Ralf Speth said: ‘Every new Jaguar Land Rover model line will be electrified from 2020, giving our customers even more choice. We will introduce a portfolio of electrified products across our model range, embracing fully electric, plug-in hybrid and mild hybrid vehicles.’There is already a strong link between the Royal Family and Jaguar Land Rover.In April Prince Charles became the first VIP to be seen in Jaguar’s new I-PACE electric car – on the day that the heir to the throne was confirmed as the Queen’s successor as head of the Commonwealth.He used the all-new electric Jaguar I-PACE for official duties at during the Commonwealth Heads of Government (CHOGM) meetings – having been kept abreast of its hi-tech and environmentally-friendly development towards more ‘green’ electric cars for more than a year.The new I-PACE was unveiled at the Geneva motor in Spring with first customer deliveries begin in June priced from £62,000 to £84,000. The zero-emissions coupe accelerates from rest to 60mph in just 4.5 seconds with a top speed of 298 miles and enough battery charge to drive 300 miles from London to Newcastle on one charge.Jaguar Land Rover his the only car maker to hold three royal warrants: from the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and Prince Charles. JLR’s German-born chief executive Dr Ralf Speth has an honorary knighthood, which ca be granted to foreign nations, but recently took up UK citizenship.The Queen is regularly seen and photographed driving Land Rovers around her royal estates and, as Hon Second Subaltern Princess Elizabeth, trained during the war as a truck mechanic with the Territorial Service ‘ATS’.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/18/4C78CD8B00000578-5750501-One_runner_asks_the_driver_Are_you_f_stupid_as_another_says_I_m_-a-4_1526837413876.jpg","title":"Astonishing moment motorist drives car path half marathon runners ignoring restrictions","story":"    Driver was caught on camera in Plymouth knocking over a cone and almost injuring runners as they attempt to block the vehicle ploughing into participants in the city\u0027s half marathon          One runner asks the driver \u0027Are you f******* stupid?\u0027 as another says \u0027I\u0027m a police officer you\u0027re breaking the law\u0027          There\u0027s no indication the woman wanted to cause any harm and goes on to explain she\u0027s attempting to get out of the city to work, not knowing which way to go          More runners pile in and say \u0027The road is closed, you\u0027re just going to have to wait and another adds \u0027don\u0027t be so stupid, you\u0027re going to kill someone\u0027          A Plymouth City council Highways official races over, telling the driver \u0027don\u0027t move, stay there\u0027           The woman then replies: \u0027I can\u0027t get out...listen, I have tried to get out every which way\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/16/4C788C3500000578-5750557-image-m-18_1526831395577.jpg","title":"The voice viral yanny vs laurel debate revealed Broadway actor","story":"    Jay Aubrey Jones , 64, has been revealed as the viral voice recordingThe voice behind the viral \u0027yanny\u0027 vs \u0027laurel\u0027 sensation has been revealed to be a Broadway actor and singer.Jay Aubrey Jones, 64 , was trained in pronunciation and has admitted that he recorded the word \u0027laurel\u0027 for Vocabulary.com in 2007.Now 11 years later, Jones\u0027 voice has gone viral with the actor saying one thing and hundreds of thousand of people hearing another. \u0027I recorded my batch of words,\u0027 he told TIME,  \u0027and I thought that was that.\u0027 In total he recorded about 36,000 words over the course of six months, according to Vocabulary.com, a site that teaches words and pronunciations. The New Jersey native said he was \u0027amused to no end\u0027 when he found out his voice had created heated debate consuming social media and even involving celebrities. \u0027I thought, well, it couldn\u0027t be that huge.

But some of it is also the mechanics of your ears, and what you’re expecting to hear.\u0027While older adults tend to start losing their hearing at higher frequency ranges, they are more likely to hear Laurel, which also means that younger people can hear Yanny.This also explains why, if you listen on a device with a different frequency, you may hear Yanny when you heard Laurel at first, and vice.

And yet Doria’s loneliness on the bride’s side was brutally obvious.And there was her hand, fluttering, for one uncertain moment, towards Prince Charles. Immediately, his hand reached out towards hers and, in a gesture that seemed to symbolise the joining of two very different families, she held on to it firmly as he gently pulled her into the group.No face in the chapel on Saturday glowed with pleasure as hers did at that moment, even more than when it was turned towards the Most Rev Michael Curry, drinking in his fervent and unexpectedly lengthy message of love.For her, there were tears, too, moments before her daughter entered through the West Door to make her solitary progress halfway down the aisle to the top of the nave. Quickly, Doria controlled her emotions. Not easy for her. Indeed, nothing was easy for her last week.Sore heads? Wills and Kate cover their eyes with sunglasses...George who-ney? Police keep actor and his wife waiting for...Share this articleAs she flew alone to Heathrow on an 11-hour flight from Los Angeles on Wednesday, family discord threatened to overshadow her daughter’s big day. Although, of course, it was her ex-husband’s side of the family and did not directly affect her.Meghan’s personal assistant, Amy Pickerill, was at the airport to greet her and take her to Kensington Palace. After that came 48 dazzling hours when Meghan’s sole family representative had tea with Prince Charles and Camilla at Clarence House and then with the Queen and Prince Philip at Windsor Castle.With Charles and Camilla, she felt comfortable and welcomed. What made it so much easier was that Meghan was there with Harry, with his jokes and easy manner. At least she had met Harry before, at the Invictus Games in Toronto.With the Queen, though, it was not quite so easy as they talked over tea (a blend of Darjeeling and Assam) and fruit cake in the Oak Room, where Her Majesty has tea every day in her private apartment in the castle.  Charles and Doria pictured in St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding of Harry and Meghan MarkleAlthough the Queen has a lifetime of experience making uneasy guests feel at home, Doria was nervous at first. However, by the time she was saying her goodbyes 40 minutes later, she was much more relaxed.At 61, Doria Ragland had suddenly been elevated into the social stratosphere. But why should we be surprised that she rose so superbly to the occasion? Those who know Meghan’s family have always noted that the actress gets her brains and her fluency from her mother.Doria’s start in life was as the bright, only child of a single mother whose parents were the bell-boy and lift-girl in a hotel in Cleveland, Ohio – a five-star establishment for white guests only. She was in the top academic stream at school but, money being short, didn’t go to university and instead began training as a make-up artist.It was on the set of ABC’s popular TV series General Hospital that she met the show’s lighting director Tom Markle, a orced man with two children, and married him.Meghan was their only child before they in turn orced, though amicably, even continuing to go on holidays together. One can only wonder what her ex-husband, apparently unable to be at the wedding because of a recent operation, felt as he watched Doria on the arm of the Prince of Wales.The truth is that Doria has conducted herself with extraordinary dignity since it emerged that her only daughter was marrying the Queen’s grandson.Never an attention-grabber, her work in Los Angeles as a yoga instructor and social worker, particularly among the elderly, has not allowed the excitement or the sudden spotlight to change anything about the way she goes about her life. Never for her the staged paparazzi pictures her ex-husband so foolishly allowed himself to do. No interviews. No efforts to profit from her daughter’s happiness.           Doria Ragland, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall walk down the steps of the chapelThat said, her daughter becoming the Duchess of Sussex changes things. Being an in-law to the royal family hasn’t meant too much to the parents of sons or daughters who have married into the Firm.Traditionally, they would be welcomed by the royal family, share the wedding and then summarily be forgotten. For example, the mother of Mark Phillips, Princess Anne’s first husband, complained that she and her husband were ‘virtually ignored and never invited to anything by the palace’.That attitude changed with the arrival of Kate Middleton.Even before she and Prince William married, her parents, Michael and Carole, were regularly extended invitations to royal homes. They have stayed as guests at Balmoral and Sandringham.William has insisted they are included in royal gatherings – they’ve been guests of the Queen at Royal Ascot, participating in the carriage drive down the course.Harry will want to go the same way, and for royal doors to be as open to Meghan’s mum Doria as they are to the Middletons.For now, at least, Meghan’s mother will continue to live 5,500 miles away in LA and go to work as normal, so her participation in royal life is hardly likely to be as frequent as Mike and Carole Middleton.But judging by the way she linked arms with Prince Charles on the steps of the chapel, when those embossed invitations come she’ll certainly be able to handle it."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/22/4C6B8C6C00000578-5751241-image-a-43_1526853472685.jpg","title":"So Beckhams Clooneys invited royal wedding","story":"Take style tips from Julia in a dress by Tom FordFind it at Farfetch!Deciding what to wear to a wedding can be tricky at the best of times, but when it\u0026#39s the wedding of the century...

The Royal Wedding hits and misses by LIZ JONESThere were no real clangers on the big day. No outrageous hats from Eugenie and Beatrice. No outrageous bottoms threatening to eclipse the bride. There were only two slight faux pas: Amal Clooney threatened to outshine the sun, and the mother of the bride wore mint while the Queen chose lime: almost, almost a colour clash.On the whole, the female guests – particularly the Royals – had put in time and effort to get it right, and had clearly been poring over the springsummer catwalk photos to make sure they were all bang on trend. Hence, there was lots of asymmetric tailoring on show, so much so many assumed Windsor had been built on a hill. The HITS              Pippa Middleton in a £495 print by British label The Fold.

The length of skirts proved problematical: either a tad too short, a la Eugenie and Joss Stone, or midi length, which looks great on teenage supermodels but a little droopy drawers on normal women.Not too many gloves on show: the Duchess of York, a surprise hit on the day, was a rare fan, with a short navy pair, and the Queen, of course, wore hers.Hats were all proper structures, and not half-baked fascinators. And, thank the Lord, on such a hot day there were plenty of pretty open shoes displaying toe cleavage: not possible if the ceremony had taken place in a cathedral.Heels, though, were as high as the sun in the sky.Rumour has it slippers were handed out later for those who could no longer teeter after yet another glass of champagne             Amal Clooney chose a marigold dress by Stella McCartney with a bow at the back and a train            Singer Joss Stone sported shorter hair and swapped her hippy look for a girly print            Carole Middleton looks very elegant in Princess Diana\u0027s favourite atelier Catherine Walker            Pastel Stella McCartney for Oprah Winfrey, with a Philip Treacy turkey and pheasant feather hat            Countess of Wessex wears ice-blue satin by London couturier Suzannah and hat by Jane Taylor            Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Gina Torres in a very elegant floral tea dress by Costarellos            Fergie was a picture of elegance on Saturday as she paired a navy skirt suit with a Jess Collet hat and towering heelsThe MISSES            Sofia Wellesley, James Blunt\u0027s wife, is in new season Valentino.

Some even believed the space in front of the Queen was left empty for Princess DianaThen there was the bridal bouquet of forget-me-nots — the Princess’s favourite — that Harry hand-picked from the walled garden at Nottingham Cottage, his home at Kensington Palace.The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Both rings were part of Diana’s small personal jewel collection — there were also aquamarine drop earrings and a charm bracelet bought by Prince Charles. Not much really, for the mother of a future King, and nowhere near the amount of jewellery the Prince has since lavished on the Duchess of Cornwall.All the other major pieces Diana had were returned to the Royal Collection after she died, but Harry and William inherited her privately owned trinkets.Each has used these treasured pieces for the truly significant moments in their lives.\u0027Keep waving, Philip!\u0027: Lip reader reveals the Queen\u0027s...The moment Prince Charles grabbed Doria\u0027s hand, she was one...Share this articleBut perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes.Some might think she would not ordinarily have been the most obvious choice. Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, who often accompanied her on official engagements as a lady-in-waiting.And Jane’s marriage to the Queen’s then private secretary, Sir Robert — now Lord — Fellowes, with whom Diana quarrelled, had created tension between the two women.Harry, however, wanted it to be Aunt Jane. He is close to the Fellowes’s children, Laura, Alexander and Eleanor. As youngsters they lived and played together at Kensington Palace and there were memorable holidays to Necker Island, Sir Richard Branson’s Caribbean hideaway.Visits to Aunt Sarah and her children at their home in Lincolnshire were less frequent.  The ring Meghan wore to the evening reception had been a gift to Diana in 1996. After her orce, when she no longer wanted to wear her sapphire engagement ring — now worn by Kate — it sometimes appeared on the third finger of her left hand.Tellingly, William also asked Jane’s daughter Laura to be godmother to Princess Charlotte.Indeed, these deep links ensure that for both Harry and William, their mother continues to play a huge part in their lives.Only four years separated Diana from Jane, and many listening to her read from the Song of Solomon in St George’s Chapel were mentally transported back to Jane’s powerful contribution at Diana’s funeral.Then, her voice, cracking with emotion, had sounded so like Diana’s.In the intervening years, she has remained the most low-profile of the Spencer family. So low, indeed, that many were surprised she agreed to carry out such a prominent role.She spoke the lines with feeling but you could sense that, unlike the bride, she is a woman used to living a totally private life and who, for the best of reasons, had taken her courage in both hands to do something this public.For her part, it was perhaps a healing act — and with Harry’s overture to her, a similar gesture on his side. We all recall the harsh, long-scarring words of the Spencer sisters’ little brother Charles, Earl Spencer, at Diana’s funeral, when he spoke of Diana’s ‘blood family’ — a phrase interpreted as deeply wounding to the Windsors.In all circumstances, how appropriate it was for Jane and her husband to be sitting in the sovereign stall where the Queen normally sits. And, significantly, the couple were on the steps near Harry and Meghan when they had their first kiss as man and wife.This was proof, surely, that Meghan and the Spencers are going to get to know one another very well in the coming months.Meanwhile, sprinkled among the congregation in some of the most prized seats, were friends of Diana who played key roles in her life.There was Carolyn Bartholomew, with her husband William, in the front of the choir, facing the best man and the Prince of Wales. She is Harry’s godmother and was one of three young women who shared Diana’s Earl’s Court flat and was privy to the secret when she first met Charles.Willie Van Straubenzee, Diana’s tennis partner and confidant, was across the aisle from her friend Julia Samuel and her husband Michael — she is Trustee and Founder Patron of Child Bereavement UK, a charity with which Meghan and Harry have formed strong links.Diana’s childhood friend, the former Lady Carolyn Herbert — who is married to John Warren, who oversees the Queen’s equine interests — was sitting alongside George Clooney.Poignantly, Harry’s one-time nanny Jessie Webb, whom Diana hired, was seated next to Princess Anne’s son, Peter Phillips.No royal ceremony, it seems, is complete without Sir Elton John, who has been entertaining the Queen’s guests since Prince Andrew’s 21st birthday party in 1981. It was there that Diana, not yet married, first met Elton — the pair danced the Charleston for 20 minutes.  Perhaps the most indelible element of Diana’s legacy was not in any physical object but in the choice of speaker for the ceremony’s only reading — her sister, Lady Jane Fellowes (left). Diana was closer to her eldest sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, but Harry chose Jane who they visited regularly as kidsIt was a friendship at first sight, but their relationship was complicated at times.In 1997 they fell out after the pop star used pictures of Diana and the boys, among others of semi-nude models, for a charity fundraising book. They were reconciled at the funeral of the murdered fashion designer Gianni Versace.Six weeks later, Diana was dead.Elton performed at Diana’s funeral and because Harry knew how much his mother had loved Elton’s music, he invited him to attend the wedding — and to perform at the reception.One intriguing element of the day that was noted by many television viewers was the empty seat in front of the Queen and next to Prince William.Could it have been a deliberate and profoundly emotional gesture by Harry, leaving a space for his absent mother?As touching as this sounds, the real reason is more mundane.Remember that St George’s is the Queen’s private chapel and this particular seat is one she doesn’t find comfortable. Nor, under protocol, can anyone sit in front of her.So no one did.For many, however, it served as an emotional symbol of Harry’s deep sadness that his mother could not be there. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/20/04/4C7500D500000578-0-image-m-3_1526787951879.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan funk classic Land 1 000 Dances","story":"   At one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks.

Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/05/4C6D7D2100000578-5751779-image-a-58_1526878184151.jpg","title":"Newlyweds Harry Meghan return royal duty fairytale wedding","story":"  Meghan Markle reportedly didn\u0027t talk to her father, Thomas Markle, on her wedding day.

So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansPrince Harry and Prince William have a laugh waiting for MeghanMan hit on head with shovel as violence erupts at London petrol stationThe Queen arrives for a preview of the Chelsea Flower ShowPrince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowMoment staff deliver over a dozen pizza\u0027s to Windsor castlePrince Harry leaves Coworth Park to marry Meghan MarkleMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.

ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million.

Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/10/4C7D643300000578-5752637-image-a-15_1526895188903.jpg","title":"Is Nessie Schoolgirl eight snaps footage splashing waters Loch Ness","story":"    Eight-year-old Laria Annand was visiting the loch with her grandmother, Marie, when they noticed strange movement in the water\u0027We were just taking silly pictures of each other and splashing our feet in the water.\u0027\u0027I just looked up and that’s when I spotted the flickering in the water.\u0027It looked as though the light was bouncing off something but there were no boats or people and it was something long - very long.

Tomorrow she will attend her first official engagement as a royal, at a Buckingham Palace garden party to mark Charles\u0027s 70th birthday.Meghan has, sources say, already become a strong influence on the direction of Harry\u0027s public work, particularly his championing of women\u0027s issues.The couple plan to become \u0027Commonwealth champions\u0027, to the delight of the Queen. A trip to Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga in October is being discussed at the highest level and aides are promising that the second half of this year will be \u0027incredibly busy\u0027 for the pair.They will also take a couple of short trips before the summer, including a visit to Dublin.

She has been so touched by how welcoming he has been to her and her mother.\u0027 The couple spent their first night of married life in Windsor Castle\u0027s Lancaster Tower, before enjoying a night at a mystery location. But they will return to work this week, having postponed their honeymoon.

You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C77614C00000578-5753665-image-a-110_1526913292811.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan plan one night mini moon jet Ireland","story":"    Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away      Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Now we need your support again in the elections on June 24,\u0027 Erdogan told a rally in a Sarejevo sports hall, where supporters waved Turkish and Bosnian flags.Ahead of the 2017 referendum, ministers travelled to countries with big Turkish communities -- including Germany and the Netherlands -- to urge support for the change, but were stopped from campaigning by authorities citing security fears.Erdogan nevertheless said last month he was expecting to hold a campaign rally in a European city.          Some 15,000 supporters gathered to attend the AKP\u0027s rally ahead of the 24 June snap elections in Turkey          About three million Turks living abroad are eligible to vote in the election\u0027At a time when renowned European countries claiming to be the cradle of civilisation failed, Bosnia and Herzegovina showed by allowing us to gather here that it is a real democracy not a so-called one,\u0027 he told the crowd.Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who heads a right-wing coalition opposed to Turkey joining the European Union, said last month Erdogan would be barred from \u0027trying to exploit\u0027 Europe\u0027s Turkish communities.Germany, home to about 3 million people of Turkish origin, says it will not allow foreign politicians to campaign on its territory ahead of elections.Earlier in the day, Erdogan pledged a multi-billion euro investment in a motorway connecting Belgrade and Sarajevo.Thousands of Turks came from Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, and from across the Balkans for the rally.\u0027Turkey is our mother nation,\u0027 said Coskun Celiloglu, a Macedonian student of Turkish descent. \u0027We came to Sarajevo just for one day to support our saviour Erdogan.\u0027The most popular -- and isive -- politician in recent Turkish history, Erdogan has ruled for 15 years, overseeing a period of rapid economic growth. But a widespread crackdown against his opponents has led rights groups and Western allies of the NATO member to voice concerns about Turkey\u0027s record on civil rights and Erdogan\u0027s growing authoritarianism.On Saturday, Turkey\u0027s state-run Anadolu agency reported there had been tip-offs about a potential assassination attempt against Erdogan while he visits the Balkans.Asked about the report, Erdogan said: \u0027This news reached me and indeed that is why I am here ... Such threats and operations cannot deter us from this path.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/14/4C807C8600000578-0-image-m-25_1526910118740.jpg","title":"Driver caught eating takeaway meal wheel cyclist catches up","story":"    A driver was seen on camera eating while in the driver\u0027s seat, as a furious cyclist approached him after a close passGesturing to the driver, the cyclist says: \u0027You, that close.

Education has helped make us this way, think this wayTo witness her joy that day — the joy of all of them — was to have reconfirmed the purpose of lifetime education, and to feel all the more honoured to be a small part of an extraordinary institution.This was the University of Hope, the place where anyone can get a degree if they work for it, no matter what background, no matter what age. Some were even older than me!I attended just that single ceremony, but every year, at venues across the country, around 8,000 students take part in these joyous events. Every one of those graduates has a story to tell.Many will know what it is to have missed out on a good education because of poor schools or home circumstances, and the reality of juggling day jobs and family life with study, working to complete assignments while others sleep or enjoy their weekends.They have learned the hard way that to reach their goal requires sacrifices that many of us who went to traditional universities would never consider.So the ceremonies are more than just a celebration of their own achievement, they are a celebration of joint success with others who know what donning that gown and walking onto that stage really means.I was born into a world where higher education was free. In the Sixties, I had a grant from West Sussex County Council that enabled me to go to university. I was not a great student, but those precious years gave me more understanding of the world about me, and of myself.All around me at King’s College London were teachers who knew and loved their subject, and many were good at passing it on. I may not have been academically talented but I grew up in the light of their wisdom and understanding. I was lucky, and I know it.How the world has changed. In a country infinitely richer than it was then, we now charge our students an arm and a leg to go to university. We saddle them with debt.Former England captain Terry Butcher chokes back tears as he...Mother, 20, who put medical student in a coma and seriously...Share this articleYes, I know the arguments. Many more young people now go to university than in the Sixties. Apparently, this country, the sixth richest economy in the world, cannot afford it.And I know the other argument too. Why should the taxes of the many pay for the higher education of the few? Well, because the benefits of a well educated society should be of benefit to all of us, to society as a whole.Of all the universities we have, the one I feel we should treasure most is the one that is most available to us all — and that is the Open University (OU). Founded by Harold Wilson in the late Sixties, in the face of opposition across the political ide, it has become the university of the people, and should be numbered, along with the 1944 Education Act, the BBC and the Government’s early intervention initiative for children, Sure Start, as one of the greatest educational initiatives this country has made.These movements between them have unquestionably enriched our nation and the lives of millions of people. They have helped spread wisdom and knowledge and understanding, and most of us have benefited from this. Not all of us, not enough of us, but most of us.King Alfred, he who burnt the cakes all those years ago, was a brave, wise and good king, who was determined that wisdom must be restored in his kingdom that without wisdom, nothing is worthwhile. He was right of course. He set out to bring literacy and education to the people. It was a noble ambition. But it is unfinished business.In our times, the OU has been foremost among those institutions doing all it can to fulfil King Alfred’s dreams of a country ever more united by education, where a good education is open to everyone regardless of income. Education is the pathway to wisdom.If the citizens have wisdom, the country and society flourishes. Alfred knew that. We know that.          Michael Morpurgo (pictured) says the university \u0027opens hearts and minds, and changes lives\u0027We know that higher education should be available throughout our lives, yet the Open University is in crisis, obliged — like other universities — to charge ever higher fees to students after a withdrawal of central funding in higher education.Its fees, once in the high hundreds, have risen to around £5,000 pa, and the number of students has fallen as a result.In 2012, the OU had 242,079 students. By 201617, the number had fallen to 173,927. By some estimates, the OU has lost 600,000 students who might have been expected to start studying in that period.Even the former universities minister, David Willetts, who oversaw a trebling in traditional university fees from £3,000 to £9,000, has confessed his regret at the impact on the OU, and agreed that the funding of part-time education needs to be reviewed.I agree. In a world in which wisdom and knowledge and understanding should be ever more valued, successive governments have withdrawn support, and to the very people in our society who need it most. In doing so, I believe we are withdrawing from hope.Someone very close to me, who had been through great difficulty in her life, recently studied at the Open University. Like me, she may not have come out with a distinguished degree, but the course did so much to lift her self-esteem, to increase her hunger for knowledge, to enrich her life.The OU opens hearts and minds, and changes lives. If it is to continue doing its great work, cost must not inhibit students from signing up. Government — which, of course, means us as taxpayers — should step in to help.It is the principle of a fair society that those who can help should support those who need that help. Education has helped make us this way, think this way. We pride ourselves on being a fair society.So let’s do what King Alfred would want us to do — to reach out and enable all of us, young, not so young, and old, to enjoy a fine and life-long education, which we all help to pay for through our taxes.A truly fair society is a more contented society, and it is only created by education — that great pathway to wisdom, understanding and hope.Sir Michael Morpurgo, author, playwright, poet, is an Honorary Doctor of the Open University.www.farmsforcitychildren.org Farms for City Children - Life-changing weeks on working farms in Devon, Wales \u0026amp Gloucestershire"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/22/19DF651800000578-0-image-a-40_1526938591749.jpg","title":"The North South doctor divide Six times Londoners study medicine North East students","story":"    A new study has uncovered a huge gap between the number of people taking elite university subjects from London and the North EastIn medicine and dentistry, 1,585 places went to Londoners – 24 per cent of admissions – while only 245 places (4 per cent) went to those from the North East.The findings can partly be explained by population difference, as there are three times as many adults living in London as in the North East. Experts said last night the rest of the gap may be down to entrenched disadvantage in some regions.Sir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, a social mobility charity, said: ‘These figures paint a worrying picture of a consistent and pervasive regional ide in access to university.‘Talent isn’t dependent on where you grow up, so it’s just not right that your chances of studying certain subjects at university are. We have to do more to widen opportunities for talented teenagers in areas like the North East to access our best universities.’          Universities are still seeing many more people from affluent areas than poorer communities despite claims higher education is for everyone. Schools facing problems in deprived areas are not as able to produce children ready for higher education, it is claimedThe data shows the largest regional gaps in admissions were in subjects which lead to high-earning careers. In business and administration, 12,645 places went to Londoners, compared with 1,445 to those from the North East. And in mathematical sciences, 1,520 places went to Londoners, compared with 190 to those from the North East.The figures come amid continued debate about a North-South ide, with concerns raised about opportunities for young people living in parts of the North of England.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C8209A300000578-0-image-a-8_1526927832119.jpg","title":"Range Rover driver 37 lands record 172 POINTS licence","story":"    Abdful Ayeghbajeje racked up an astonishing 172 points on his licence on the A127 near Southend after breaking the speed limit 27 times along the road (file photo)Masked gunmen with Kalashnikovs open fire on a group of...Manchester bomber’s brother who is accused of playing \u0027key...Share this articleThey also imposed fines totalling £17,8230 and ordered him to pay nearly £2,500 in costs. They handed him a total of 172 points for the offences which were committed on the A127 near Southend between October last year and January 2018.Investigating officer Roy Keyes, of Essex police\u0027s Casualty Reduction Investigation Team, said: \u0027Ayeghbajeje\u0027s vehicle was registered in Belgium, so initially it was difficult to track him down. \u0027But following some good work and a chance meeting with him during a roads policing operation in Southend, we had all the evidence we needed to bring him to court.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/20/4C48B86F00000578-0-image-a-8_1526411585923.jpg","title":"Married man offers door door sperm delivery service 65 children hopes reach 100","story":"    Clive (pictured) has fathered 65 children - with 14 more on the way - and hopes to reach 100The married 62-year-old delivers sperm - his own - to willing recipients free of charge.He happily gives up whole days to drive from his family home in Burton, Staffordshire, to wherever he is needed.On arrival, Clive parks in a nearby street before climbing into the back of his van.There he fills a syringe with his product before clambering out and ringing on the recipient\u0027s doorbell.How \u0027rebel\u0027 doctor who helped 49-year-old patient become...Seventeen British sperm donors father more than 500...Share this articleA tip, he says, is to keep the donation in the crock of your arm so as to keep it warm.He then usually engages his recipient in a few second of idle chit chat before jumping back in his van.Often, he says, they are nervous, and this helps to put them at ease.\u0027I know this is probably unusual but for me, by doing it in the van there is far less involvement, less emotional attachment,\u0027 he says.Since his adventures in donation began he has fathered 65 - with another 14 on their way.

Meghan is the first mixed-race member of the royal family in an extraordinary journey for a girl born in LA to a white father and African-American mother who fought her way through the tough world of showbusiness to land a plum role in the TV series Suits.Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day couldn\u0027t have been more different than royal weddings of the past, especially because the prince was visibly emotional throughout - and guests suggested it was the most erse major event in the Queen\u0027s 66-year reign.The prince had looked tearful when he saw his bride for the first time, grabbing her hand telling her: \u0027You look amazing - I missed you\u0027 before tenderly lifting her veil.The new Duke of Sussex also said \u0027thank you, pa\u0027 after his father Prince Charles walked the now Duchess of Sussex down the aisle of St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor, having stepped in at the last moment for Meghan\u0027s father Thomas.           Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day          Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury          Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Meghan Markle told wedding guests: \u0027I\u0027ve found my prince\u0027 in an emotional speech after her ecstatic new husband said the support of his \u0027far better half\u0027 meant he could finally be \u0027me\u0027, it was revealed today.The new Duchess of Sussex also thanked the Queen, Prince Charles and other senior royals for welcoming her so warmly to the royal family \u0027firm\u0027.The bride, resplendent in a white evening gown by Stella McCartney, took to the microphone after a private evening dinner thrown by Prince Charles at Frogmore House.  Meghan\u0027s short speech was yet another part of her modernising mini-revolution of the royal family because royal brides usually leave it to the groom to address guests.The 36-year-old, who wore an aquamarine ring which belonged to Harry\u0027s mother beloved mother Princess Diana, ended her short address by declaring her deep love for Harry and said: \u0027I have found my prince\u0027, according to the Daily Mirror.Before she spoke Harry said his wife, brother, father and friends \u0027are the people that make \u0027me\u0027, me, in my Harry life\u0027 before adding: \u0027Now I\u0027m going to hand over to my far better half\u0027.Earlier he is also believed to have told his bride: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027     One source described how Meghan also expressed her gratitude at how welcoming the prince had been to both herself and her mother, Doria Ragland. \u0027She has been so touched by how welcoming the Prince of Wales has been. So is her mother,\u0027 the source said. \u0027Honestly, they are touched beyond belief. It was important to her to make a point of thanking him publicly, although, of course, he knows privately how she feels.\u0027Another source said: \u0027It is often said that he always wanted a daughter and I think he has been really moved by how well they have got on. There is definitely a special connection there. Meghan\u0027s mother means more to her than anything, so it was lovely to see the way he was so welcoming to Doria too.\u0027          Meghan and Harry looked like movie stars after they changed for the evening reception at Frogmore House          Harry and Meghan travelled in a Jaguar converted to electric power, which had a numberplate with Saturday\u0027s dateDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansPrince Harry and Prince William have a laugh waiting for MeghanMan hit on head with shovel as violence erupts at London petrol stationThe Queen arrives for a preview of the Chelsea Flower ShowPrince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowMoment staff deliver over a dozen pizza\u0027s to Windsor castlePrince Harry leaves Coworth Park to marry Meghan MarkleMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionPrince Charles had also paid tribute to his \u0027darling old Harry\u0027 in an emotional speech that is said to have left the 600 guests, including Hollywood stars, in tears.Speaking at the afternoon reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle shortly after they married he Charles told of how moving it was to watch youngest son  get married.Charles, who walked Meghan to the altar, finishing by saying: \u0027My darling old Harry, I\u0027m so happy for you.\u0027Harry, 33, is also said to have given an \u0027off the cuff\u0027 speech about how happy he was.He is also said to have turned to his guests and asked: \u0027Can anyone play the piano\u0027 – before Sir Elton John played a medley of Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.Harry also said Meghan had \u0027navigated everything with such grace\u0027, adding: \u0027We make such a great team\u0027. According to the Sunday Times. Wedding guest Peter Fearnhead, co-founder of African Parks, told the Sunday Telegraph: \u0027When Harry and Meghan came in they stood on the podium and Prince William introduced them.\u0027Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He\u0027s got a wonderfully dry sense of humour. Prince Harry was charming about Meghan, they are so clearly in love. We all had a tear in our eye.\u0027 Later he whisked his bride away in an open-top Jaguar to head for a star-studded, champagne-fuelled, black-tie reception for the bride and groom at the opulent Frogmore House in Windsor Great Park on Saturday night.The newlyweds were cheered wildly as they took to the floor with the funky soul classic Land of a Thousand Dances for their first dance at the spectacular royal wedding reception.Comedian James Corden is reported to have launched a dance routine with Harry, his brother William and his father Charles, apparently refereeing a \u0027dance-off\u0027, while George Clooney danced with both Meghan and Kate. After a very modern take on the traditional royal wedding, the late-night revelry followed suit – and those fortunate enough to bag a place on the ultra-exclusive guest list were treated to a night of risque speeches, wild dancing and plenty of stodge to soak up the alcohol.  George and Amal Clooney were the among the huge stars to celebrate with Harry and Meghan with George dancing with the bride and Kate   From left: Priyanka Chopra, Serena Williams and Jessica Mulroney show off the dresses they wore to the royal wedding party          Revellers watch the fireworks display over George III\u0027s former stately where the reception of Harry and Meghan took placeDiana\u0027s brother Earl Spencer and daughters Kitty and Eliza arriveThe Queen arrives for a preview of the Chelsea Flower ShowChelsy Davy appears deep in thought as she waits for royal weddingMeghan Markle spots old drama teacher in crowd of waving fansPrince Harry and Prince William have a laugh waiting for MeghanPrince Harry sheds a tear at the altar before marrying Meghan MarkleThe Queen leads the Royal Family for visit to Chelsea Flower ShowMan hit on head with shovel as violence erupts at London petrol stationMoment staff deliver over a dozen pizza\u0027s to Windsor castlePrince Harry leaves Coworth Park to marry Meghan MarkleMeghan\u0027s best friend Jessica Mulroney glams up for receptionExclusive details from inside the evening celebrations reveal that guests – including George and Amal Clooney, Sir Elton John and David Furnish and more glitzy actresses than an Oscars after-party – spent the evening sipping bespoke cocktails, tucking into \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 and candyfloss from outdoor stalls and dancing to a trendy DJ.It was, insiders say, \u0027the party to end all parties\u0027, with a carnival atmosphere in the grounds of the 230-year-old stately home, which once belonged to George III.  Record viewing figures made Harry and Meghan’s wedding the TV event of the year so far.It was watched by a peak of 13.1million just after 1pm on BBC1, making it the biggest peak figure so far in 2018, the broadcaster said. ITV’s coverage peaked at 3.6million.The combined average audience for BBC and ITV was around 11million. But this was lower than the figure for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding in 2011, which had a combined audience of 17.6million – although this included people watching on catch-up. Charles and Diana’s wedding was watched by more than 28million in 1981.Saturday’s FA Cup Final averaged 6.7million viewers and peaked at 8.7million on BBC1. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/09/4C7D6EC200000578-5752481-image-a-10_1526890347445.jpg","title":"Panic Turkish tourist jet flight drops 30 000ft five minutes","story":"    Sudden drop: The Onur Air Airbus 321  was travelling from Antalya, Turkey to Chelyabinsk, Russia, with 226 passengers and eight crew          Aftermath: Passengers filmed themselves with oxygen masks on after the plane, which went from 32,800ft to just 1,640ft \u0027within five minutes\u0027, had landedOn one video, a man says to another \u0027happy birthday!\u0027, then turns to the camera saying: \u0027This is horror\u0027.In the second video a stewardess is believed to ask: \u0027Are there doctors on board?\u0027A woman says: \u0027We have arrived\u0027 .The man filming the video looks into the camera and says: \u0027That was horrible\u0027.The airport in Volgograd - where England play their opening group stage match in the World Cup next month - confirmed the emergency landing.

Kate\u0026#39s Alexander McQueen gown has got to be one of the most copied styles of all time, and this breathtaking design is destined to be just as iconic. We\u0026#39ve all been speculating for months as to who Meghan might ask to create the all-important dress. Stella McCartney, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Burberry or perhaps Erdem? She kept us all guessing right up until the last moment, and as she arrived at St. George\u0026#39s Chapel in Windsor it was announced that it\u0026#39s the work of British designer Clare Waight Keller, Artistic Director at Givenchy. We love the elegant simplicity of this dress. The slight off shoulder neckline, the train... it\u0026#39s perfection.

They have slippers for us. Slippers!\u0027Meghan is also believed to have given her closest friends – none of whom was chosen to be a bridesmaid – bespoke bracelets worth £450 as a mark of their friendship and support on her big day.Once inside the grounds, guests were guided to a giant marquee at the back of the house, bedecked with stunning floral displays by royal florist Philippa Craddock.Liveried waiters circulated, offering guests drinks – English sparkling wine and ice-cold beer – and trays of light canapes, themed in the style of \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. These, and the three-course sit-down dinner, all comprised seasonal organic produce, much of it sourced from Prince Charles\u0027s Duchy Estate.While the canapes and bowl food earlier in the day had been provided by Buckingham Palace, Harry and Meghan used leading society caterers Table Talk for the evening do.          The newlyweds leave Windsor Castle after the royal wedding on their way to the reception at Frogmore House         Princess Eugenie (left), the Duke of York and Princess Beatrice arrive at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor Castle yesterday         A car carrying Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex arrives at Frogmore House for the reception yesterday       George Clooney, who attended the royal wedding earlier, arrives for the evening party at Frogmore House       Security outside Frogmore House where around 200 guests were expected to attend Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding reception              Meghan and Harry\u0027s kiss sparked huge cheers from people outside the chapel and the 100,000 watching on the streets of Windsor         The Duke and Duchess of Sussex shared their first kiss as a married couple outside St George\u0027s Chapel          A sea of smiling faces greets Harry and Meghan as they leave the church after the American-influenced service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury         Meghan and Harry process out of the chapel after exchanging vows in a quite extraordinary wedding       Harry looked delighted as he walked his new wife out of St George\u0027s Chapel to start their new life together         The couple, who are now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, organised a wedding that reflected both their backgrounds         Meghan and Harry wave to royal fans during their open-top procession through Windsor after the wedding ceremony         The newlyweds stare deeply into each other\u0027s eyes after the biggest and happiest day of their lives         This extraordinary image shows Meghan clutching her husband\u0027s gloved hand while resting her holding her other hand and bouquet, which was picked by Harry, in the lap of her Givenchy dress         Laughter: One of the well-wishers in the crowds makes Meghan laugh and Prince Harry smile as they continue with their 25-minute tour of the royal market town Insiders say that the meal was punctuated by informal toasts and speeches – most memorably a brief toast by the bride herself, who, in a historic break with tradition, stood up to thank Harry and his family for their kindness and hospitality.In return, Harry gave a gushing, off-the-cuff speech praising Meghan for \u0027navigating everything with such grace\u0027 after a turbulent week. \u0027We make such a great team,\u0027 he said. \u0027I can\u0027t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u0027Guests reportedly burst into cheers when he referred to her as his wife for the first time.Prince William is believed to have performed something of a double act with Charlie van Straubenzee, who attended prep school with Harry at Ludgrove in Berkshire.As well as a poignant reminder of how proud their mother would have been of her youngest son on his wedding day, the speech included several family in-jokes.A fourth speech was reportedly given by Charlie\u0027s older brother, Thomas, along with Tom \u0027Skippy\u0027 Inskip, who was under strict instructions from the Palace to downplay Prince Harry\u0027s exploits during a 2012 boys-only trip to Las Vegas – long before Meghan was in the picture.Actor and talk show host James Corden, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere, introducing speakers and keeping guests in stitches by gently ribbing Harry for \u0027punching above his weight\u0027. Dotted throughout the gardens to entertain the guests were outdoor games, including a giant chessboard, fairground performers and stalls offering late-night snacks – from burger and ice cream vans to candy floss kiosks and bars stocked with several types of expensive whisky.Bespoke cocktails were flowing from a \u0027round the world\u0027 bar, whose top offering was the \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027, combining rum and ginger beer – a cheeky nod to the colour of the groom\u0027s hair.Musical entertainment came from DJ Sam Totolee, a celebrity favourite who has previously played at the weddings of both Pippa Middleton and Rod Stewart, and Uma Thurman\u0027s engagement party.Harry is said to have danced \u0027furiously\u0027 to the DJ\u0027s set – which included the controversial drug-themed hit I Took A Pill In Ibiza – at Pippa\u0027s wedding last May, and had put him under strict instructions to \u0027avoid cheese\u0027 and stick to trendy house music and R\u0026ampB.          Harry looked very emotional at points in the service and several others in the congregation were in tears on their happy day         Harry and Meghan exchanged vows and then rings as the couple married after a whirlwind romance               Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland, who the star calls her rock, was in tears ahead of her daughter\u0027s big entrance         Meghan walked halfway through the church before being met Prince Charles at the Quire who took her to Harry         Meghan walks down the aisle in St George\u0027s Chapel at the start of the royal wedding ceremony in Windsor         Meghan, wearing her bridal veil, smiles at her groom Prince Harry as she arrives at the wedding ceremony in Windsor              Meghan smiles broadly during her wedding to Prince Harry at St George\u0027s Chapel in Windsor         The Archbishop of Canterbury smiles as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle stand at the altar at St George\u0027s Chapel         Harry and Meghan hold hands as they walk out of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding ceremony       Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland (far left) stands next to Prince Charles, Camilla, George, William, Charlotte and Kate on the steps of St George\u0027s Chapel after the wedding         The train of Meghan\u0027s dress trails down the aisle as she and Prince Harry stand in front of Archbishop Justin WelbyAt one point later in the evening, British actor Idris Elba – who has DJ\u0027d in some of the world\u0027s top clubs – apparently took over for a brief turn on the decks. But that didn\u0027t stop Meghan from making her own musical requests, and she is believed to have been behind the list of Sixties soul songs that were played by covers band Atlantic Soul Orchestra, which calls itself \u0027the country\u0027s hardest-hitting and most authentic soul band\u0027. Its musicians have toured and recorded with groups including Take That, Girls Aloud and Sir Elton John.Their set list included My Girl by the Temptations Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I\u0027m Yours by Stevie Wonder Marvin Gaye\u0027s How Sweet It Is and Ain\u0027t No Mountain High Enough Soul Man by Sam and Dave and Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd.The reception went on into the early hours, with music and cheering heard as far away as Windsor\u0027s Long Walk. Even as the clock struck midnight, guests could be heard singing along enthusiastically to Respect by Aretha Franklin, and Dancing In The Street by Martha and the Vandellas.The newlyweds\u0027 first dance is believed to have followed a similar theme, with Harry and Meghan eschewing a slow song for the 1966 hit Land Of A Thousand Dances by American soul singer Wilson Pickett (not, as has been reported elsewhere, Whitney Houston\u0027s I Wanna Dance With Somebody).The final coaches departed Frogmore House around 3.30am, with insiders reporting that George Clooney was among the last to stagger off the dancefloor, having earlier shown off his moves alongside actor Tom Hardy. Bleary-eyed revellers were offered bacon or sausage sandwiches for the journey home.A select few were then invited to the late-night party which reportedly took place at celebrity haunt Chiltern Firehouse in Marylebone, followed by a private party in a sound-proofed home in Chelsea. It is not known if the bride or groom accompanied them.Yesterday morning, though the newlyweds – who spent the night at Windsor Castle – were nowhere to be seen, several of the guests appeared rather the worse for wear.A weary looking James Corden was seen checking out of Coworth Park with his wife at 8am, while Jessica Mulroney did not emerge from her £600-a-night room before lunchtime. A fresh-faced Serena Williams was one of the few to make it down to breakfast.Rugby player Will Greenwood left with his wife Caroline around 9.40am, followed by Meghan\u0027s Suits co-star Patrick Adams and his children, who left for a flight to LA.Earl Spencer, Harry\u0027s uncle, was spotted at Cliveden House – where the bride stayed the night before the wedding – enjoying Bloody Marys with his family yesterday afternoon. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle¿s fun-filled wedding reception featured a royal dance-off and boozy \u0027beer pong\u0027 gamesGeorge Clooney danced with Meghan then Kate but Fergie turned him down: Exclusive details from party of the year - Mirror Online"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/10/4C7D643300000578-5752637-image-a-15_1526895188903.jpg","title":"Is Nessie Schoolgirl eight snaps footage splashing waters Loch Ness","story":"    Eight-year-old Laria Annand was visiting the loch with her grandmother, Marie, when they noticed strange movement in the water\u0027We were just taking silly pictures of each other and splashing our feet in the water.\u0027\u0027I just looked up and that’s when I spotted the flickering in the water.\u0027It looked as though the light was bouncing off something but there were no boats or people and it was something long - very long.

The fence that we built is still there.\u0027Obviously, I would prefer it in a weird way for him not to have been there, and for us to not know where he was.\u0027Because then we know that he\u0027s happy with a family member, but sadly for him that\u0027s not the case.\u0027Prince Harry mentioned fatherhood in the documentary and while reflecting on his aid work, he mused: \u0027For me I have this love of Africa that will never disappear... and I hope that it carries on with my children as well.\u0027Harry also received praise in the documentary from Sir Elton John, who urged people to go to see the work being done by Sentebale. He said: \u0027If his mother was alive, she\u0027d still be doing the work she set out to be doing, and he\u0027s carrying it on in the best possible way.\u0027Royal Wedding: Prince Harry flies in befriended Lesotho orphan in touching gesture | Royal | News | Express.co.uk"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C6FA5BE00000578-5753647-image-m-7_1526913143257.jpg","title":"PIERS MORGAN Congrats Meghan tough start lecturing equality palace","story":"    Congratulations on a stunningly successful wedding, Duchess. You couldn’t have scripted a more perfect day, though of course, that’s probably exactly what you didWhat’s the point in being a professional actress if you can’t turn in an Oscar-winning performance for the biggest role of your life?I loved it all.Well, apart from David Beckham chewing gum in the chapel, obviously. Such grotesque and disrespectful impertinence in front of the Queen would have cost him his head during previous monarchies, and I’m not entirely sure it shouldn’t now.It would be impossible to see all the ecstatic headlines about Saturday\u0027s wedding and not get slightly carried away with one’s own sense of self-worthEven your dimwit cannabis farmer nephew Tyler being caught with a knife at a London nightclub in the early hours of Sunday morning couldn’t force your beaming grin off today’s front pages.But there was one banner headline that screamed a rather different message, and one that will have sent a shudder through many a Palace courtier’s spine.‘MEGHAN MARKLE TO FIGHT FOR FEMINISM,’ said the Daily Telegraph, Britain’s most loyal royal paper.Oh-oh.I read on:‘The newly-wed Duchess of Sussex has been given the blessing of the Palace to use her position to fight for feminism as she plans for her life as the newest member of the Royal family.’The official Royal Family website appears to confirm this, highlighting your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist.’It adds: ‘From a young age, The Duchess had a keen awareness of social issues. Aged 11, she successfully campaigned for a company to alter their television advert that had used sexist language to sell washing-up liquid. These early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women’s empowerment.’          The official Royal Family website now highlights your belief that you are ‘proud to be a woman and feminist’ in your bioHarry and Meghan look deeply in love as they reveal their...Is this the best photo from the royal wedding? Twitter...Behind the scenes at Meghan and Harry\u0027s \u0027magical wedding\u0027:...Share this articleI remember discussing that very subject with you when we met for a drink in my local Kensington pub during the week you first met Harry.You told me how you wrote to Hillary Clinton demanding she take action and how thrilled you were when the offending advertising agency, Procter and Gamble, changed the commercial’s tagline which said ‘Women all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans’ to now say ‘people’ not ‘women’.‘I’ve always wanted to make a difference,’ you said, as you sipped your dirty martini. ‘My parents always told me if I believed something was wrong to try to fix it.’There was no doubting your genuine passion for this mission statement.I saw it in your eyes that night and I read it in your words when we corresponded with one another.A few months earlier, I’d emailed you after a mass shooting killed eight students at the Umpqua Community College in Oregon.‘What is it with your nation and guns?’ I asked. ‘Why does nobody ever want to do anything?’‘Shameful, I know,’ you replied. ‘It’s so deeply controversial and brings up so many other issues race relations, religious intolerances, etc – so since we can’t solve each of those in one fell swoop, the logical solution would be to have stricter gun laws. And there is resistance. Even by the sheriff in that same little Oregon town. I’m not sure how you sleep at night with that over your head unless you fall into Trump’s school of thought that it’s not the guns but the mental illness. So then why give mentally ill people access to buy guns? Legally? It’s just staggering. I wish more people would make a stand about it.’I was impressed by such an articulate and thoughtful response about a cause very close to my heart.Ironically, the day before your wedding, there was another horrific school shooting in Santa Fey that killed ten more students.This prompted the New York Daily News to scream: ‘They do royal weddings. We do schoolkids’ funerals.’I’m sure you would have liked to comment on that massacre, as you used to comment on many such news stories on your now deleted Twitter account.But of course, now you’re a royal, you can’t.Or rather, you can – but all hell would break loose.‘Meghan whacks Trump over guns’ is simply not a headline anyone at the Palace can ALLOW you to create.And therein lies the biggest problem facing you in your new life every sinew in your newly regal body will be shaking with enthusiasm to tell the world how you feel about vitally important issues like gun control.Yet you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal Family.          You have been so outspoken in the past, but you will very quickly discover, if indeed you haven’t already, that it’s impossible to go political as a member of the Royal FamilyAnd that brings me back to your intention to ‘fight for feminism.’On the face of it, this seems a perfectly rational objective for an intelligent, independent, successful woman who in many ways personifies the very ideals of feminism.But I can guarantee you three things if you start poking this bear too loudly:1) The Palace machine, still heavily under the influence of the senior royals, will get very twitchy very quickly – just as they did with Princess Diana.2) That twitchy machine will begin to brief the media with anonymous voices expressing ‘concern’ at your activism.3) The British public, fuelled by the negative media coverage, will soon start thinking, ‘Oh stick a cork in it, Meghan, for goodness sake.’This may all seem horribly unfair to you, but in truth, it’s not.The Royal Family has survived this long precisely because it doesn’t do politics.The Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything.  Remember Meghan, the Queen has reigned for more than 60 years but nobody has a clue what she thinks about anything. Same with her mother. And when Prince Charles does weigh in, he\u0027s ridiculedHer late mother, the Queen Mother, was equally taciturn, once famously articulating this perfect recipe for remaining beloved by the people: ‘Never complain, never explain and rarely be heard speaking in public.’Now, it’s true that Prince Charles regularly fires off angry letters to politicians about issues, but it’s also true that he gets roundly ridiculed for it.And while William and Harry have talked a lot about mental health in recent years, they’ve always been very careful to be non-political in their campaigning.They chose mental health because it affects everyone and is therefore not an issue determined by wealth or privilege.The Princes can’t be called ‘hypocrites’ for saying we should all take mental health more seriously.Your chosen causes of feminism and equality are very different matters.Let’s be honest: there’s nothing remotely feminist or equal about being a Duchess and living in a gigantic Palace.You can’t preach about everyone getting a fair shake when you yourself are getting the most prestigious, privileged and unequal shake imaginable, simply for getting married, to a man.Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst didn’t fight for your right to wear a tiara to state dinners or have your liveried servants heat your cashmere water bottle at night.So tread carefully, Meghan.          Tread carefully. You\u0027re now riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism because you looked fabulous , didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince, but that well of goodwill can dry up fastAt the moment, you’re riding a tremendous wave of excitement and optimism.But that’s because you looked fabulous on your wedding day, didn’t put a foot wrong, and married a very popular Prince.If you now start lecturing us all on equality, while your servants fluff your gold monogrammed pillows and your chauffeur warms up the fleet of vintage Rolls Royces, that well of goodwill may dry up faster than David Beckham’s gum wherever he stuck it in the chapel.And I can assure you that Season 2 of your new life will be a hundred times harder as a result.Don’t be too disheartened though.There is no better feminist role model for you than the Queen who has spent a lifetime keeping her opinions to herself yet is the most respected woman alive.Proof that when it comes to royals and politics, less is more.Kind regards, Piers."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/15/4C77614C00000578-5753665-image-a-110_1526913292811.jpg","title":"Harry Meghan plan one night mini moon jet Ireland","story":"    Unlike other newlyweds, Harry and Meghan will not be jetting off on a honeymoon straight away      Be a beautiful bride like Meghan in Clare Waight Keller for GivenchyClare Waight Keller for Givenchy Haute CoutureHead to the Givenchy website herePrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s big day is finally here and we haven\u0026#39t been this excited for a dress since the Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s wedding back in 2011.

Mr Abramovich was one of his early supporters, recommending him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin when the ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the High Court in London, Mr Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow in the second half of the 1990s.In October 1999, he attended Mr Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Mr Abramovich allegedly bought Mr Putin, then the prime minister, a $50million (£37million) yacht. ‘The request came from Mr Putin,’ Mr Berezovsky said in evidence.In 2003, Mr Abramovich bought Chelsea for £60million. Two years later, he was involved in a much larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13billion (£10billion).He began spending time in London, where he owns a 15-bedroom Victorian mansion on ‘Billionaire’s Row’ in Kensington, bought in 2009 for a reported £97million and now worth at least £150million.

You would never catch her expressing an opinion in public — but she has her own way of making her views clear.So it is perhaps no coincidence that the Queen saw fit to confer upon Meghan Markle the title of Duchess of Sussex on the occasion of her marriage to Prince Harry.After all, there is no better county in Britain more suited to this most politically correct of new royals.It plays host to Brighton and Lewes, spiritual homes to those members of the liberal intelligentsia for whom Hampstead and Islington have become a trifle too reactionary.So what better title to confer on the couple who have just staged the most ‘woke’ wedding in royal history.For those unfamiliar with this fashionable expression, ‘woke’ denotes a person whose sensibilities are perfectly attuned to the modern way of thinking. That is to say, someone who is rigorously respectful of iniduals’ life choices and cultural traditions, scrupulously virtuous in both thoughts and deed — and who sees each new day as an opportunity to spread the gospel of inclusivity and ersity.It’s fair to say that the Royal Family has never been terribly ‘woke’.InjusticeSound asleep and snoring loudly might be a better way to describe their general attitude to political correctness, especially in the Duke of Edinburgh’s case.But Meghan and Harry are here to change all that, and their wedding was only the beginning.Less than 24 hours after saying her wedding vows, a biography of the Duchess of Sussex was put up on the royal website, underlining the selfless nature of her existence and her burning desire to oppose injustice in all its forms.Above all, it cites her ‘keen awareness of social issues’ and tells us she is ‘proud to be a woman and a feminist’.It also speaks of her ‘lifelong commitment’ to ‘social justice and women’s empowerment’.These are all deep preoccupations in the mind of the new duchess, the website informs us.But then we kind of knew that already, did we not? After all, Meghan and Harry seem to have spent the entire period of their engagement proselytising on such right-on issues.          Britain\u0027s Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, center, in Windsor Castle surrounded by their little loved ones. (From left back row) Brian Mulroney, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Jasper Dyer, Prince George, Ivy Mulroney, John Mulroney front row, Zalie Warren, Princess Charlotte and Florence van Cutsem          Meghan Markle\u0027s official page launched on the Kensington Palace website says she will continue with her charity work And for anyone who had not yet cottoned on to Meghan’s Mission, Saturday’s wedding ceremony will have made it crystal clear.There was the invitation to a former gang leader among 2,000 ‘ordinary’ guests invited to the wedding itself. And there was the request that instead of wedding gifts, donations could be given — among other worthy recipients — to a charity that empowers women in urban slums.Meghan and Harry’s big day was, as much as anything, an exercise in making sure the entire world knew exactly how much they cared about everyone as well as each other.The ultimate royal wedding souvenir... for sale on eBay:...\u0027Do the right thing, Meghan\u0027: Royal bride\u0027s sister calls on...Share this articleEverything about it was scrupulously politically correct, from the hand- embroidered flowers on her veil (representing all 53 countries of the Commonwealth) and the choice of a non-polluting electric battery-powered car (albeit worth a very uninclusive £350,000) in which Harry drove them to the after-party at Frogmore House, to the dress itself, a £200,000 creation designed by the first British woman to head a Paris couture house.Even the flowers were locally sourced. As if that weren’t enough, Meghan took herself down the aisle (an audacious look-at-me move which is apparently a feminist triumph), succumbing only briefly to tradition to take Prince Charles’s arm — though note that he was not ‘giving her away’ — and wrote and delivered her own speech at the reception.But perhaps the strongest statement of all was the people in St George’s Chapel, the guests and performers.The American preacher Michael Curry who, with his iPad and Episcopal passion, blew away the cobwebs the brilliant young cellist, Sheku Kanneh-Mason, who held us all spellbound during the signing of the register the wonderful Kingdom Choir gospel ensemble, led by Karen Gibson.          An official photograph released by Kensington Palace shows Meghan and Harry surrounded by their loved ones, including the Queen and Prince Philip AdmireNot to mention all the representatives from various charities espoused by the royal couple.And then the celebrities, there for their roles as charity do-gooders as much as their glamour: David Beckham, Oprah Winfrey, Elton John, Amal Clooney. Everywhere you looked, a festival of ersity and inclusivity, not a note out of place. It was perfect.Almost too perfect, some might say.Because for all the gushing tributes, there was something just a little ostentatious about all the sincerity.Don’t misunderstand me: I think that Harry and Meghan make a wonderful couple, and I am sure they will bring nothing but benefit to the Royal Family. And I admire their commitment to doing good in the world.But sometimes one gets the sense that they are ever-so-slightly just a little bit pleased with themselves, a little too keen to convey their selfless dedication to those less fortunate than they are.To be fair, this is a common affliction of the modern age.The days when royals such as Princess Anne just went off quietly and got on with their charity work without really mentioning it to anyone apart from the odd horse are, sadly, long gone.And it is hard to imagine a future monarch behaving like the Queen, full of warmth and generosity towards her subjects, yet at the same time able to maintain that all-important mystique that still surrounds the monarchy and makes it so compelling.For all the positives of Harry and Meghan’s all-star union, this is my one worry. That in seeking to show the world what a wonderfully modern couple they are, they will unintentionally undermine the institution of monarchy — and risk turning the whole thing into a circus of virtue-signalling.And the problem with that is that it becomes less about the people they wish to help, less about the causes and issues that Meghan is so passionate about — and all about them.Already with the wedding, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a sense that it was as much engineered to cast the couple in a certain beatific light as it was to honour those involved.There is no question that, as royal weddings go, this broke all the moulds in terms of overcoming barriers of class and race.          Feminist and activist Meghan Markle will not stop her charitable work when she begins royal duties, she confirmedElitistAt the same time, though, it also felt strangely elitist, as though they were simply replacing one exclusive club — the aristocracy — with another, Hollywood celebrity.The trick to any kind of modernisation is being able successfully to blend the old with the new without alienating either.To understand how and when to respect certain traditions and not to be subversive just for the sake of it.There is a lot about the Royal Family that remains sacred to the people of Britain, however irrational that can sometimes seem.Let us rejoice at the evolution of monarchy but let’s also not turn it into a glorified lifestyle blog for guilt- ridden millennials.It is wonderful that Meghan and Harry have such a shared passion for doing good in the world. And I have no doubt that, together, they will prove to be a great force for change.I just wish they would be a little less #MeToo about it all."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/21/19/4C8209A300000578-0-image-a-8_1526927832119.jpg","title":"Range Rover driver 37 lands record 172 POINTS licence","story":"    Abdful Ayeghbajeje racked up an astonishing 172 points on his licence on the A127 near Southend after breaking the speed limit 27 times along the road (file photo)Masked gunmen with Kalashnikovs open fire on a group of...Manchester bomber’s brother who is accused of playing \u0027key...Share this articleThey also imposed fines totalling £17,8230 and ordered him to pay nearly £2,500 in costs. They handed him a total of 172 points for the offences which were committed on the A127 near Southend between October last year and January 2018.Investigating officer Roy Keyes, of Essex police\u0027s Casualty Reduction Investigation Team, said: \u0027Ayeghbajeje\u0027s vehicle was registered in Belgium, so initially it was difficult to track him down. \u0027But following some good work and a chance meeting with him during a roads policing operation in Southend, we had all the evidence we needed to bring him to court.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6adf356b82f985dac227d9d369765f959a62f11e/0_0_5472_3648/master/5472.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=0dd33f72d2028fb7fd5bfdaf29e4b3fd 2020w","title":"mfon women photographers of the african diaspora in pictures","story":"The MFON journal and book by Laylah Amatullah Barrayn and Adams Delphine Fawundu is committed to establishing and representing a collective voice of female photographers of African descent and features more than 100 from across the diaspora.

This has improved boarding and punctuality, the airline said, but O’Leary added that “it is creating a handling issue, especially at peak periods” such as bank holiday weekends and during the summer.“There are many flights where we’re now having to put 100 or 120 gate bags free of charge into the hold,” O’Leary said in a video presentation. “If that continues to build, it’s something we may have to look at again.”However, O’Leary warned of a fall in profits this year, saying the outlook was “on the pessimistic side of cautious”. He said there could be strikes in some countries over Ryanair’s discussions to recognise trade unions, but the airline would face any action down.O’Leary said air fares were likely to be flat over the coming year, as it takes about 12 months for changes in fuel prices to feed through to fares. He added that he believed airlines that had not hedged oil prices, such as Norwegian, would struggle next winter and that this would “accelerate the shakeout” in the industry, with some carriers going bust.Ryanair averted widespread Christmas strikes by unilaterally recognising unions in December for the first time in its 32-year history, but it has struggled to formalise relations in some countries. “Being unionised means we will have occasional strikes,” O’Leary said.Ryanair repeated its warnings about the risk of a hard Brexit, and said it would scrap voting rights for non-EU shareholders if there was no transition agreement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/04d57029ae6309f1441a44545d0c25ef186a2e4f/0_207_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b22d43ae43a03d3a00cdd0ffcb2de2c","title":"labour voters back remain lewisham east soft brexit","story":"There are lessons from the Lewisham East selection process. For all the arguments and jockeying, the soft Brexit candidate wonLewisham East, for which Labour has just chosen its prospective parliamentary candidate, is a erse south London constituency of quite widespread deprivation, yet also has some giant houses and rich people. It is the scene of generative and committed community organising – against the necessity for food banks, against the closure of its hospital – and some trenchant and passionate activists in both its constituency Labour party and Momentum branches. “Trenchant and passionate” sounds like a euphemism for infighting, and sometimes it is.The Momentum meeting last month to elect its new committee was so fraught that half the room walked out and reconvened in the pub. Yet this is what local politics should look like, if it’s to mean anything: there will be battles people will not always agree not everything will be solved by persuasion it’s in the DNA of activism that some people will be very annoying. Local groups are kept alive by debate, and wither when they bury their isions and argue instead about who is the most loyal, or realistic.It is a cliche of the age that “real” Labour politics happens or should happen in its “heartlands”. When people refer these days to heartlands, what they invariably mean is defined as an area that’s been left behind, and the signature of the left-behind is that they’re not interested in politics. This is a rhetorical\u0026nbspmanoeuvre to maintain the authority of the status quo-ists: if authentic politics resides with the unengaged and the unheard, everything they think must be mediated through an MP or commentator who has somehow ined their true hearts. People who turn up to Momentum meetings and fight to the death for the appointment of its disabilities rep aren’t “real” people and therefore don’t need to be heard. Lewisham East is as true a Labour heartland as any seat in the country. Its residents are only an elite if you consider proximity to the National Maritime Museum a more important metric than median household income.Lewisham East is a seat in south-east London, where areas of affluence sit alongside pockets of social deprivation. The urban centres of Catford, Blackheath, Lee and Grove Park fall within the constituency. It has been held by Labour since 1992 when Bridget Prentice was elected. In the last local elections the wards inside the leafy constituency returned 21 Labour councillors. Membership to the Labour party has shot up in Lewisham from 1,200 after the 2015 general election to just under 1,700.\u0026nbspIt was, as Novara Media’s Aaron Bastani noted, inspiring to see the shortlist consisting entirely of black, Asian and minority-ethnic women: Janet Daby, who eventually won Sakina Sheikh, who became known as “the Momentum candidate” Claudia Webbe, a member of the Labour national executive committee, and the Unite choice and Brenda Dacres, who withdrew for health reasons and threw her support behind Daby. Broadly, both Daby and Dacres were known as the “centrist” or “Labour right” candidates – these terms are so vexed and indefinable that it’s simpler to know them as non-Corbynites except that, as a member, Daby voted for Corbyn in both leadership elections. So she is a Corbynite, but not a proper one, according to some rules that I’m afraid I don’t know.Reports claimed that a last-minute manoeuvre could have resulted in Sheikh’s removal from the shortlist, for her role with the Take Back the City (TBTC) campaign, a grassroots movement about housing, wages and affordability in London, which once fielded some candidates against Labour in some distant London Assembly election. To a political insider, this would have been just the way things work: if factions are competing for the same votes, and one side can get the other on a technicality, fair’s fair. To an outsider, it was ludicrous and outrageous: Sheikh’s involvement with TBTC was minimal anyway (she chaired a hustings for them, and wasn’t a member) if a prospective candidate isn’t allowed a history of cooperation with other grassroots organisations of similar outlook, then not just the Labour party but also the entire dream of a reinvigorated democracy is completely sunk.Somebody, somewhere, obviously agreed with that, since Sheikh was back on the ballot by the time of the hustings and would – for what it’s worth, which is not very much, as I’m not a Lewisham member – have had my vote. Except for one small thing she vowed (granted, on Twitter, never a very solid vow-platform) never to defy the party whip on Brexit, because south Londoners “don’t have strops, they make history”. It is a peculiar and faintly nasty Brexiteer frame, to characterise dissent as childish and silly, and obedience as epoch-making. If you opposed Brexit, the obvious candidate to vote for would be the most remain-leaning: Daby.And the wider lesson from all of this? In volatile and, more to the point, opaque times, when every election has a subtext and every stage has its behind-the-scenes, a victory can and will be claimed by anyone with the chutzpah. Yet I don’t think it’s unreasonable to submit, on the basis of Daby’s support for both the single market and the customs union, and the cheers she got at the hustings when she very clearly said so, that hers is a victory for remain furthermore, that remain is still, for all of Corbyn’s strategic ambiguity on the matter, the overwhelming preference of Labour voters.It’s not a victory for the Labour “centre”. Only Daby’s opponents ever defined her against the party’s left. It’s not a vote against Momentum, or against Unite, whatever the highs and lows of their campaigning. It was a vote – and a pretty conclusive one – in favour of the views Daby openly expressed. And what might this mean in terms of the debate? Never let a complex backstory blind you to the bleedin’ obvious. And then, perhaps, act on what you’ve \u0026nbsplearned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d807083812632f1ba13db0c73362c5ad98aa399/0_0_2290_1374/master/2290.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2374168f524ff4fd10e4dc612a4c11e2","title":"how we made the blair witch project","story":"‘We were listed as deceased on IMDb. Our parents started getting condolence calls’I grew up around the woods and swamps of Florida. For a long time, I had this idea of seeing a stick figure hanging from a tree and it creeped the hell out of me. Ed Sánchez, a friend from university who ended up co-directing, helped me work this into a 35-page treatment about three students who go missing after heading out into the Maryland woods to make a documentary about a legendary witch. The idea was that this film was put together later, using the footage they shot. In the late 90s, with digital coming into its own, it was only a matter of time before someone made this kind of first-person movie.The treatment covered what happens, but it had no dialogue – we wanted it all improvised. The original plan was for it to be three guys, but we had to cast Heather Donahue after what happened during her audition. We asked actors to pretend to be at a parole hearing and explain why they should be released. She said: “I probably shouldn’t be released.”We set up a base at a house in Germantown, Maryland, that Ed shared with his girlfriend. There were 10 to 15 of us there for six weeks, sleeping on couches and on the floor. The shoot took eight days and was a 247 operation. It wasn’t like a normal film: the actors would work the cameras, filming each other all the time. Using GPS, we directed them to locations marked with flags or milk crates, where they’d leave their footage and pick up food and our directing notes. These would say things like: “Heather, you’re absolutely sure that to get out of this mess you go south. Don’t take no for an answer.” Or: “Josh, somewhere along the way today, you’ve had it with this bullshit.” They had the freedom to decide how to play it: we only intervened if we felt they needed to tone things down. Then there were the “gags” we’d pull at night that they had to react to – like hearing the children’s voices, or feeling the tent being shaken.All in, it cost about $300,000 – and it made nearly $250m worldwide. Not too many movies have had such a cultural influence. It popularised the found-footage approach, for better or for worse. There’s a common misunderstanding that not a lot went into it, but it took two years of effort to make it look like it was just shot by three students over a long weekend.Heather’s parents were worried Ed and Dan might be taking her out into the woods to make a snuff movie. I was up for any kind of adventure back then, so said yes when the two of them asked me to play the cameraman. Tensions got high, we got hungry, we got uncomfortable and we hurt each other’s feelings. So we came up with a safe word for whenever we had to break character and remind ourselves this was just a job: taco. We regretted that by about day three. It just kept reminding us how hungry we were.At the time, I felt bad about my final attack on Heather – when I turn the camera on her and yell at her about what her motivation is. It was me, expressing frustration as both a character and an actor, but it worked on another level: the idea of us all as performers. The film was inadvertently prescient about the idea of 15 minutes of fame. The fear level on the night-time interventions wasn’t actually that high. Your body would have finally warmed up the sleeping bag enough for you to fall asleep, then you’d hear baby noises outside. It was more annoying than anything else: we’ve got to act now. My character got killed first, so I took a really long shower, got stoned and went to Denny’s.We went from total anonymity to the cover of Newsweek in a very short time. Artisan played the real-life disappearance angle as much as possible. We were specifically not invited to the Cannes premiere and, for a while, were listed as deceased on IMDb. Our parents started getting condolence calls. There are people who still don’t believe it’s fiction. I sometimes think Artisan would have been happier if we had actually been dead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4ca8f036d9f3521b6a1f3414c9b3d159f9f21224/0_195_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a64371ffc59b48730aa91ae6eb5b7667","title":"six times as many new medical students from london as from north east","story":"Only 245 students from north-east England started medicine and dentistry degrees last yearThere were more than six times as many students from London taking up places to study medicine and dentistry last year as there were from north-east England, analysis shows.The figures come as the government and the profession push to expand the workforce, through measures such as opening new medical schools.Press Association analysis of Ucas data shows that 245 students from the north-east took up places to study for medicine and dentistry degrees last year, compared with 1,585 from London. These were the two regions accounting for the highest and lowest proportion of acceptances for the subject area.Across all subject areas, five times as many students from London as from the north-east took up places on any degree course.While some of this can be put down to variations in the population – London has around three times as many adults as the north-east – the difference is markedly larger in some subject areas. Some of the biggest disparities come in subjects that are likely to lead to high-flying careers, including medicine and dentistry, business and mathematical sciences.Concerns have been raised in some quarters about opportunities for young people living in parts of the north of England. One charity said the data painted a “worrying picture of a consistent and pervasive regional ide” in university access.Mita Dhullipala, co-chair of the British Medical Association’s (BMA) medical students’ committee, said: “With many areas across the country facing significant NHS staff shortages and many places struggling to attract and retain staff, more must be done to address the current disparities throughout the country in the number of those starting medical courses.”In March, Jeremy Hunt announced that new medical schools were to open in Sunderland, Lancashire, Canterbury, Lincoln and Chelmsford, training student doctors from this September.The move was part of a package of measures aimed at bringing more medics to areas that traditionally struggle to attract doctors. Previous research has shown that doctors tend to remain in the areas in which they trained.The government has also announced plans for an extra 1,500 student doctors to be in training by 2020, with 6,701 medical students in total due to start their training this September.Dhullipala said: “While the introduction of five new medical schools places, including one in the north-east, will go some way towards improving accessibility to medicine, there is also a need to address the additional obstacles that exist with a focus on widening participation.“As well as providing the necessary funding and foundation programme training posts to accompany additional medical school places, more must be done to ensure that those with the potential to become a doctor are given the opportunity and support to do so.”“The expansion also targets applicants from disadvantaged backgrounds to widen access to medicine and ensure even more talented students have the chance to become the NHS doctors of the future.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/953f8353ad81e2b27257d9d6308527f3aa951905/0_108_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=433c8693f5f41485de215eddc840d75e","title":"jurgen klopp desire delivers liverpool dreams","story":"Jürgen Klopp believes Liverpool’s bravery, work-rate and desire for a sixth European Cup can compensate for Real Madrid’s greater experience when the sides meet in the Champions League final. Saturday’s contest in Kiev will be Real’s fourth Champions League final in five years, with Zinedine Zidane’s holders aiming to lift the trophy for a third consecutive season. No club has won a hat-trick of European Cups since Bayern Munich in 1974, 75 and 76.Liverpool’s recent European record pales by comparison but having reached a first final in 11 years with several exhilarating performances and scored a competition record 40 goals en route, their manager is confident his team’s virtues can prove decisive in Ukraine.Klopp refused to be drawn on whether Real should be favourites but said: “They are more experienced, that is a fact. If there is a market for experience they should sell it because then they would be even richer. Experience is very important in life but it is not the only thing. It is important to be more experienced but youcan level it with desire, attitude, work-rate and that is what I love in football. We made our own experience.“We are not as long together as Real Madrid because they play these finals pretty much with the same team so as a group they are very strong. That is all fact, but it is still football and we have a chance and let’s give it a try. Let’s go there and try to perform on a level which maybe people would say is not possible for us but it is possible.”Klopp added: “We did all the things we need to do plenty of times already in the Champions League campaign and now we need to do it again. Real Madrid is a really good football team but we are a really good football team. We are full of desire and we really work for our dreams.”The Liverpool manager expects his team to play without fear against Real having thrived on the pressure of reaching the final and next season’s Champions League on the last day of the Premier League season with an injury-hit squad. He also cited brave attacking displays against Manchester City and Roma in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively as reason to approach Kiev with optimism.Klopp added: “We had a lot of pressure and a lot of expectations in the last few weeks. Each game we drew we wanted to win. I said all that rubbish after West Bromwich Albion only because I was really angry we didn’t win. I am not a psychologist but if somebody would tell me constantly that everything is different in the next game then I would get nervous.“We have to handle it like an opportunity because it is an opportunity. You cannot go into a football game knowing you can lose it. I experienced that plenty of times but I am still a happy person. Life goes on. We will show the players why it makes so much sense to be brave. It was not easy to be brave against Manchester City and against Roma but we did it. The moment we tried to defend the result we were almost out. I am in a good mood. I am really looking forward to the game. Unlike the Brighton one, I would buy a 1-0. This game I really want to play.”Long-term absentees Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Joël Matip were the only senior players missing from training on Monday as Liverpool stepped up preparations for Kiev while Emre Can, along with Adam Lallana, significantly increases Klopp’s midfield options for the final.“The mood is very good for the club, for us and for the boys because we finished the season in the best way,” said the manager.“We felt really good and then having time to prepare for the game is really good. We could do a lot of things and didn’t have to compress it into two or three sessions.“We could do a lot of things in training. We have three more sessions and then we will be best prepared for the game. We feel good and think we deserve to be where we are because the boys showed up in the campaign.“It was very exciting and now we want to bring it to the best possible end.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a615eed5430bd525439490f42888c032c8fc3917/246_51_3727_2236/master/3727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69b955f478914f1d4a4e46ed32bc679a","title":"unai emery arsenal psg neymar","story":"The tactically astute and well prepared Spaniard will find a more receptive audience in the Emirates dressing room than with an unruly PSG squadNeymar is not one for ‘homework’, but that didn’t stop Unai Emery. “We are analysing some videos with him to see how he can grow,” said Emery last year, “especially in his positioning and how to work with his colleagues.” While Emery’s quiet meticulousness may have proven crucial in the past, spending 12 hours looking over videos for every game, with hindsight his persistence with the Brazilian should be regarded as having been a little optimistic.While Neymar may have balked at the idea of incessant videos, reportedly complaining to the Paris Saint-Germain board about the Basque technician’s demands, Emery might find his new audience in north London to be more receptive. He is a supremely detail-orientated and tactically astute coach, and although this style of management did not play out well in Paris, the Arsenal squad will experience a heightened level of structure in their preparation. “Emery put on so many videos I ran out of popcorn,” former player Joaquín quipped, “he’s obsessed by football, it’s practically an illness.”Where Arsène Wenger’s teams may have descended into the painfully one-dimensional, Emery’s outlook is one of nuance and precision, which may well suit Arsenal’s developing team rather more than the entrenched, haughty collection of Parisian stars.Crucially for Arsenal’s philosophy as a club, Emery, despite rampant short-termism in Paris, managed to maintain a degree of focus on youth. His development of Adrien Rabiot from an inconsistent, naive ball-playing midfielder to the physical, confident, box-to-box marauder he is at his best today should be applauded. While the introduction of 22-year-old French centre-back Presnel Kimpembe, now arguably PSG’s best defender, and Argentine international Giovani Lo Celso is also a credit to Emery’s faith in youth and his ability to evolve talent.The 46-year-old\u0027s managerial career began in Spain\u0027s second ision and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain\u0027s second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad. Emery, a left-sided midfielder, also turned out for Racing Ferrol, Leganés and Lorca Deportiva before a knee injury ended his playing career at the age of 32.Emery is offered the manager\u0027s position at Lorca Deportiva after his knee injury, and goes on to lead the team into Spain\u0027s second ision. In his first full season, Lorca miss promotion to La Liga by just five points.Emery comes to the attention of Spain\u0027s big clubs after guiding Almería to their first promotion to La Liga, and securing an eighth-place finish in the top flight. He is snapped up by Valencia in the summer of 2008.Emery replaces Ronald Koeman at cash-strapped Valencia and sets about returning the club to the Champions League. He leaves Valencia in 2012 after three consecutive third-place league finishes.The first blot on Emery\u0027s managerial copy book comes in Russia, where he lasts just six months at Spartak Moscow, and is sacked after a 5-1 derby defeat to Dynamo.After returning to La Liga with Sevilla in January 2013, Emery leads them to three consecutive Europa League titles. Sevilla beat Liverpool 3-1 in Basle to complete the hat-trick in the manager\u0027s penultimate game in charge.PSG finish second to Arsenal in their Champions League group, and then thrash Barcelona 4-0 in the first leg of their last-16 tie. On the verge of a European breakthrough, they lose the second leg 6-1 and crash out. PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Despite the success he enjoyed with a more counter-attacking 4-2-3-1 set-up with Sevilla, Emery was reluctantly forced to switch to a more possession-based 4-3-3 at PSG after early attempts to move Marco Verratti into a No 10 role failed and the dressing room pressured him into reverting to the favoured formation which Laurent Blanc and Carlo Ancelotti had previously practised. The combination of detailed tactical insight and counter-attacking brought about a glorious, unprecedented hat-trick of Europa League titles at Sevilla, a record that appealed to PSG, a club obsessed with European success. His time with Valencia also proved fruitful, a trio of third-place finishes between 2010 and 2012 being highlights before their recent lean period.Nevertheless, despite five trophies in two seasons in Paris, Emery’s stay in the French capital has been characterised by mishaps that fall somewhere between unfortunate circumstances and outright errors of judgment. Player power has long been an endemic issue, ingrained during the Zlatan Ibrahimovic era. Neymar’s arrival, and the club’s subsequent pandering to him, has only played into the idea that the PSG squad is particularly unruly. Emery, however, while willing, was unable to address this.When Neymar and Edinson Cavani’s relationship exploded following a squabble over who should take responsibility for set-pieces at the beginning of season, with Thiago Silva reportedly having to separate the two strikers after the home game against Lyon in September, Emery said that they could “sort it out themselves” rather than decisively asserting his authority.PSG’s squad in the Qatar Sports Investments era has proven prohibitively cliquey and, the Brazilian contingent became so strong over the summer, with the additions of Neymar and Dani Alves, that Emery was discouraged from removing a failing and noticeably aging Thiago Silva as captain. Another example of weak man-management was illustrated with the cases of both Rabiot and Ángel Di María, who over the last year have succeeded in forcing him to play them once again in their preferred positions, despite the Spaniard’s efforts to remove them from the deep-lying midfield role and right-wing respectively.Understandably, Emery received severe criticism for the now infamous “remontada” defeat to Barcelona last year. Here however, it seems he was a victim of a lack of mental fortitude in a squad, which he admittedly failed to address himself. PSG under QSI have long lacked heart and the Qataris have struggled with, or even ignored, the significance of the club’s identity. PSG’s lack of gumption in potentially era-defining Champions’ League ties seems rooted in a sense that while winning is important for the squad, winning for PSG is not, and when put under pressure, they dramatically wilt.The 6-1 defeat at the Camp Nou was not a product of an omnipotent Barcelona display but willed into existence by sheer determination, a drive Emery, Blanc and even Ancelotti have been unable to foster. The ferocious press and intensity of the 4-0 win in the first leg, Emery’s doing, evaporated, Thiago Silva’s leadership was non-existent and unfathomable mistakes were made, all largely beyond Emery’s control. He has also been forced to operate in something of a box at PSG, constrained not just by his unruly squad, but also by the club hierarchy, with little say in player recruitment policy, leading to a ludicrously top-heavy squad.Whether Emery is the antidote to the furore that has surrounded Arsenal during Wenger’s final years in charge or the correct choice at such a crossroads is debatable, but Emery will certainly improve Arsenal’s players and mould the side into being far more tactically streetwise.His stoic, measured demeanour is comparable to Wenger’s, particularly with the press. As a result, he too will be unable to act as a lightning rod to draw attention away from any negative coverage or stimulate supporters with a fiery personality. However, in contrast to the PSG dressing room, Emery is likely to discover a more malleable and open-minded audience in England, which will suit his style.At Valencia, Emery’s video ‘homework’ was delivered via USB drive. When he suspected one player was not following his advice, Emery gave him a blank drive. “Did you watch it?” Emery asked. “Yes, don’t worry boss,” came the reply. Emery may not be charismatic, but his stint at PSG must largely be viewed as an anomaly in an otherwise successful managerial career, built upon tenacious hard work and strokes of occasional tactical genius.“Arsène who?” was the famous headline when Arsenal last hired a new manager in 1996, and Emery’s appointment will ask more similar questions of the Frenchman’s successor than Arsenal fans might have hoped when this day came. But if the squad commits wholeheartedly to Emery’s modus operandi, then both club and manager have a genuine chance to disprove the doubters and show that they deserve to be mentioned amongst the bracket of Europe’s best."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d028a50090872cdd677924eadb422a6f5423efd7/0_0_2114_1268/master/2114.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c81c29b2dee18230a1fdf3dfbaa00f0b","title":"unai emery set to replace wenger arsenal manager","story":"Arsenal have moved to appoint Unai Emery as the successor to Arsène Wenger. The club have conducted a thorough recruitment process as they look to replace Wenger – their manager of almost 22 years – who departed at the end of the season and Mikel Arteta had been considered as the favourite for the past week or so.However, the signs on Monday were that Emery, the former Paris St-Germain and Sevilla manager, was set to be chosen. The club have spoken to him and a decision is expected to be confirmed later in the week.Emery is a safer bet in terms of his experience and, in the end, it is this factor that has swayed the decision of Ivan Gazidis, the Arsenal chief executive, who has led the recruitment drive. Arteta, the former Arsenal player, who is now a member of Pep Guardiola’s coaching staff at Manchester City, has not yet managed a club whereas Emery has been in the business since 2005, when he cut his teeth at Lorca Deportiva in his native Spain.The 46-year-old has gone on to take charge at Almería, Valencia, Spartak Moscow, Sevilla and, most recently, PSG – clubs of mounting profile – and he has impressed Gazidis, even though he is not fluent in English.The 46-year-old\u0027s managerial career began in Spain\u0027s second ision and has taken him to Russia, France and major European honoursWhile Arsène Wenger is being unveiled at Arsenal, Emery settles in at Toledo in Spain\u0027s second tier after leaving his first club, Real Sociedad.

PSG also lose out to Monaco in the French title race.Emery wins Ligue 1 and both Cup competitions in France to take his trophy haul at the club to five, but another last-16 Champions League exit leads to his departure at the end of the season.Emery is happy to work within the management structure that Gazidis has put in place at the Emirates Stadium – in which there are prominent recruitment roles for Raúl Sanllehí and Sven Mislintat. He enjoyed eye-catching success at Sevilla, where he won three consecutive Europa Leagues, and he won the championship at PSG in this past season, although his relative failure in the Champions League, in the shape of a last-16 exit against Real Madrid, cost him his job. He has been replaced by Thomas Tuchel – the one-time Arsenal target.Arteta had a meeting with the Arsenal hierarchy last week and he was confident that he would get the job. Guardiola had said he would not stand in Arteta’s way and talks had progressed to the point where the potential make-up of his backroom staff had been discussed.Arteta ticked plenty of boxes for Gazidis, who was looking for somebody to represent the club’s values, including giving youth a chance, and play fast and attractive football.Gazidis had made it clear he was not afraid to make a left-field appointment, noting on the day Wenger’s departure was confirmed that the Frenchman had not been “on many people’s radar screens” in 1996.But Emery, too, ticked the boxes and, crucially, he came to look like less of a gamble. It is understood that Arteta was told his lack of experience came to count against him. Gazidis is not a man synonymous with risk-taking. After careful consideration, analysing each argument from every conceivable angle, he has come to see Emery as the outstanding selection.The new manager is expected to have around £50m, plus money generated from sales, to spend on reshaping the squad, which is broadly in line with what Wenger was granted, annually, in recent seasons. It is not a lavish budget and it is clear that the new man’s coaching skills will have to be up to scratch from the outset.Santi Cazorla, the Arsenal midfielder, had been linked with a possible player-coach role under Arteta but he has now left the club upon the expiry of his contract. He has not played since he injured his achilles in October 2016, although he remains determined to carry on as a player.Gazidis said: “Santi is always one of my favourite players to watch. His natural ability with both feet, his speed of thought and movement were central to our best performances in recent years. He plays with a joy and freedom which is very rare. We wish him well for the future and thank him for his important contribution to our club.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/76e8bb6c137a4d98380778af22c31eb029f34767/213_223_2441_1464/master/2441.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d918f8ba725c91eec1225d04cd571da9","title":"frank ocean album blonde dissect cole cuchna","story":"Cole Cuchna of the podcast Dissect is devoting his third season to Frank Ocean deep es – and aims to unpack a record extraordinarily rich in detailIn 2016, the eagerness for a new Frank Ocean record had transformed from healthy anticipation into irritable impatience. For four years Ocean had made repeated promises about the record’s release date, only for him to miss his own deadlines. Fans desperate for new music began mocking his tardiness on social media. Ocean responded in kind by stamping all the record’s missed released dates on a library card.Then in August that year, Blonde was finally released, and it sounded … weird. It’s an album that on first listen doesn’t necessarily sound like a classic – there are so many layers of vocals and instrumentation. ’s five-star album review at the time said it was one of the most “baffling, contrary and intriguing records put out by a major pop star – not just this year, but any year”.Its magic was that it contained puzzles, both in its production and lyrical content – a lead vocal line that had been obscured would suddenly step forward from the shadows, three-quarters of the way through a song. As fans and critics gave it more of their time, a consensus began to emerge that it was Ocean’s greatest work. By December, Time, the Atlantic and Vulture had all declared it the record of the year. It’s hard to think of another record so rewarding to those willing to give it the time.Speaking on the phone from his home where he is still writing and recording episodes for the series, Cuchna says only by going into that level of depth can you begin to unpick a record so rich in detail. “It’s hard to write about, it’s so nuanced and complex,” Cuchna says. “This approach is the only way you’re going to get to something worthwhile, it’s just a record you have to spend a lot of time with.”He says that some of the episodes will focus more on production while others will go line-by-line, exploring the narratives and themes emerging in the lyrics. He’s excited about the episode on Super Rich Kids, about a character that starts his days on the roof and by the end of the songs falls to his death. “It has all these overtones of what it means to be born into wealth,” he says.Cuchna says he’s “obviously” doing two episodes on the 10-minute Channel Orange track Pyramids because it’s “a song that tells is essentially the history of the black woman – from royalty in Egypt to the present day – dealing with issues in America”.In past seasons, which have focused on records by Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, Cuchna has had a fairly large trove of interviews with the artists themselves to draw upon, but Ocean has barely spoken to the press in the past six years – meaning that for Blonde at least there’s little of the artist’s own interpretation of his work avaliable.The four albums he’s focused on so far have been released in the past decade, and Cuchna says he purposely chooses recent works. His overall aim is to recontextualise these albums, not just as recent classic but part of the overall popular music canon, as worthy of investigation as Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band or Thriller.Cuchna says: “It’s me proving that these are seminal works, that they’re the best representations of culture at this particular time. Looking back in 50 years, they’re what we’re going to be remembering. These are great albums but they’re also cultural artefacts they can be studied.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d488d6a7b163c3e400c026fa1c7a90acf43773/0_0_2976_1984/master/2976.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8dc09593e2be8c04de193109c06ebc68 880w","title":"theresa may brexit customs backstop very limited circumstances","story":"Remarks follow Boris Johnson saying Brexiters expect PM to avoid triggering mechanismTheresa May has said that her backstop plan to keep Britain aligned to the customs union beyond 2020 would only apply in a “very limited” set of circumstances as Brexiters ratcheted up pressure on her over the future customs relationship.The prime minister said nobody wanted the UK to resort to the option despite persuading her “war cabinet” to sign up to new proposals last week, marking rare progress on Brexit after weeks of deadlock.Her remarks come after Boris Johnson issued a thinly veiled warning that he and his fellow Brexiters would still expect May to deliver a deal on customs that avoided triggering the backstop, one of the sticking points in talks with Brussels.The foreign secretary said that leave supporters who feared betrayal over future customs arrangements should understand that the prime minister was “very clear that this is not an outcome we desire”.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, told an event organised by the Policy Exchange thinktank: “The whole point about the backstop is that it’s intended not to be implemented, but it’s there just in case.” May rejected the EU’s version of the backstop, which would involve keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union to avoid a hard border, in February when she told parliament no prime minister would accept the UK being so ided. However, some in Westminster believe that if Brussels accepts the UK’s alternative plan, which would retain key aspects of the customs union if a solution to the Irish border problem has not been found, it could become the post-Brexit norm. A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.In a speech in Macclesfield on Monday, May said: “What we’re proposing is an alternative backstop proposal, but nobody wants this to be the solution that is achieved. “We want to achieve the right solution through our overall relationship with the European Union. If it is necessary, it will be in a very limited set of circumstances for a limited time. But we are working on achieving that commitment to Northern Ireland through our overall relationship with the European Union.”The cabinet remains deadlocked over the final customs arrangement Britain that should pursue and HMRC officials believe neither model under consideration will be ready to implement the end of the transition period in December 2020.It remains unclear whether the EU27 will accept the government’s version of the backstop plan, which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs to imports but leave it free to strike new trade deals.Meanwhile the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn will be in Manchester on Tuesday on the first anniversary of the Manchester Arena bombing.Writing in the Manchester Evening News, the prime minister said: “The targeting of the young and innocent as they enjoyed a carefree night out in the Manchester Arena on May 22nd 2017 was an act of sickening cowardice.“It was designed to strike at the heart of our values and our way of life in one of our most vibrant cities with the aim of breaking our resolve and iding us.“It failed, for such appalling acts of wickedness will do nothing but strengthen our resolve to defeat such twisted ideologies and beliefs.The resilience and determination shown by Manchester in the 12 months since is testament to that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0388dc305afc887a64e7643c77aa952048c0ddf0/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e43b01f9877bf342afaea4cbf953e79","title":"scientists find secret behind sweet sound of stradivarius violins","story":"The instruments achieve their sweetness and brilliance by mimicking aspects of the human voice, study saysThe violins made by the Italian masters Andrea Amati and Antonio Straari are celebrated as the finest ever made, but the secret behind their perfect sound has mystified experts for centuries.Now scientists in Taiwan believe they have hit on an answer. Using software normally reserved for speech analysis, they found that violins from the two Cremonese luthiers mimic aspects of the human voice, a feature they argue adds to the instruments’ exceptional musical quality.The scientists recorded a professional violinist playing 15 antique instruments at Taiwan’s Chimei Museum and compared the acoustic signatures with those from 16 male and female vocalists who were recorded singing English vowel sounds.The researchers found that the early Italian instruments produced human-like “formants”, the harmonic tones that correspond to resonances in the vocal tract. Specifically, the Amati violins produced formants similar to those from bass and baritone singers, while the Straari instruments had higher-frequency formants, closer to those of tenors and contraltos.Hwan-Ching Tai, an author on the study at the National Taiwan University, said Straari violins are often described as having “brightness” and “brilliance”, both qualities that could be rooted in the higher-frequency tones that make the instruments sound closer to female voices.“Some Straari violins clearly possess female singing qualities, which may contribute to their perceived sweetness and brilliance,” he said. Female singers tend to have higher-frequency formants than males because their vocal tracts are shorter.Born in 1505, Andrea Amati is credited with inventing the modern violin. His instruments were so successful that the designs were copied for generations. Antonio Straari, who was born 139 years later, inherited Amati’s methods and designs and improved on them until he was manufacturing instruments now widely considered to be unsurpassed.Tai and his colleagues decided to compare the acoustic features of antique violins with those from singers after reading a quote from Francesco Geminiani, a famous baroque composer and author of The Art of Playing on the Violin, one of the most influential violin manuals ever published. Writing in the 1751 book, Geminiani described the secret of violin performance as “giving the instrument a tone that shall in a manner rival the most perfect human voice”.Tai suspects the uncanny resemblance between early Italian violins and human voices is not an accident. “The early violin was not a solo instrument but an accompaniment to songs and dances,” he said. “It is conceivable that Andrea Amati may have wanted to build a string instrument that could imitate human voices to blend into such music.” Tai, whose work is published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, is not the first scientist to search for a theory of the Italian masters’ success. Other researchers have claimed that the secret lies in the varnish, or in the density of the wood, even as others have shown that concert audiences actually prefer the sound of modern violins.Christian Lloyd, managing editor of the Strad magazine, said violinists often talk about their instruments with words typically used to describe voices. “People talk about their violins being lively, sweet or mellow,” he said. “If they don’t like the sound, they’ll say it’s metallic, tinny or steely. The worst thing you can call an instrument is dead.”In the past, Lloyd said, violin makers kept their manufacturing methods close to their chests, so secrets, whether important or not, were part of the business. But today, manufacturers are far more open and share details of their designs and methods. As a result, he said, the best instruments made today are on a par with Straari’s.For the latest study, Tai looked only at antique violins, raising the question of how modern violins would have fared in comparison. “Who’s to say the modern instruments won’t give you the same qualities?” Lloyd said. “We don’t think there are secrets of the Straarius.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/399ff3fb7cd7987b633a8d2b237baa5ba0ab2ccd/0_75_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f71471f1d40bca41742281a03e6bc850","title":"benefit sanctions found to be ineffective and damaging","story":"Study concludes that punishing claimants triggers profoundly negative outcomesBenefit sanctions are ineffective at getting jobless people into work and are more likely to reduce those affected to poverty, ill-health or even survival crime, the UK’s most extensive study of welfare conditionality has found.The five-year exercise tracking hundreds of claimants concludes that the controversial policy of docking benefits as punishment for alleged failures to comply with jobcentre rules has been little short of disastrous.“Benefit sanctions do little to enhance people’s motivation to prepare for, seek or enter paid work. They routinely trigger profoundly negative personal, financial, health and behavioural outcomes,” the study concludes.Despite claims by ministers in recent years that rigorously enforced conditionality – including mandatory 35-hour job searches – incentivised claimants to move off benefits into work, the study found the positive impact was negligible.It calls for a review of the use of sanctions, including an immediate moratorium on benefit sanctions for disabled people who are disproportionately affected, together with an urgent “rebalancing” of the social security system to focus less on compliance and more on helping claimants into work.In the “rare” cases where claimants did move off benefits into sustained work, researchers found that personalised job support, not sanctions, was the key factor. With few exceptions, however, jobcentres were more focused on enforcing benefit rules rather than helping people get jobs, the study found.“Although some examples of good practice are evident, much of the mandatory job search, training and employment support offered by Jobcentre Plus and external providers is too generic, of poor quality and largely ineffective in enabling people to enter and sustain paid work,” it says.For those people interviewed for the study who did obtain work, the most common outcome was a series of short-term, insecure jobs, interspersed with periods of unemployment, rather than a shift into sustained, well-paid work.Sanctions generally delivered poor outcomes, including debt, poverty and reliance on charities such as food banks, the study found. Often imposed for trivial and seemingly cruel reasons, they frequently triggered high levels of stress, anxiety and depression.“The outcomes from sanctions are almost universally negative,” said the director of the study, Prof Peter Dwyer of the University of York.The study found that, in many cases, the threat of sanctions had the unintended effect of encouraging a “culture of counterproductive compliance and futile behaviour” among some claimants, who learned “the rules of the game” rather than becoming genuinely engaged with work.Claimants with chaotic lives – who were homeless or had addictions, for example – reacted to the “inherent hassle” of the conditionality system by dropping out of the social security system altogether. In some cases, they moved into survival crime, such as drug dealing.Low-paid workers on universal credit who were subject to so-called “in-work conditionality” – a requirement for them to work more hours or face sanctions - in some cases elected to sign off, foregoing rent support and tax credits, to avoid what they saw as constant, petty harassment from jobcentre staff.Welfare conditionality – the notion that eligibility for benefits and services should be linked to claimants’ compliance with certain rules and behaviours – has been progressively embedded into the UK social security system since the 1990s, although the scope and severity intensified dramatically after 2012.Sanctions are imposed when claimants supposedly breach jobcentre rules, typically by failing to turn up for appointments or applying for enough jobs. They are effectively fined by having their benefit payments stopped for a minimum of four weeks (about £300) and a maximum of three years.At its peak in 2013, under the then secretary of state for work and pensions, Iain Duncan Smith, there were more than a million sanctions. Between 2010 and 2015, a quarter of all people on jobseeker’s allowance were sanctioned, with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) issuing £132m in sanctions penalties in 2015.Sanctions fell to 350,000 in 2016 as a series of critical reports emerged questioning their effectiveness and calling for changes, including from the all-party work and pensions select committee, the DWP’s social security advisory committee and the National Audit Office. A fresh inquiry by MPs into sanctions is under way.The Economic and Social Research Council-funded welfare conditionality study was carried out between 2013 and 2018 by researchers at six universities. It included repeat qualitative interviews over two years with 481 welfare service users in England and Scotland as well as interviews with 57 policy experts and 27 focus groups.Dalia Ben-Galim, the policy director at the single parents’ charity Gingerbread, said: “Rather than threatening single parents with sanctions and widening the ‘conditionality’ agenda, it would be much more valuable to enable the conditions to support employment such as affordable childcare, access to flexible work and personalised support through job centres.”“We tailor requirements to inidual cases and sanctions are only used in a very small percentage of cases when people fail to meet their agreed requirements set out in their claimant commitment.”Labour’s shadow secretary for work and pensions Margaret Greenwood said: “The current sanctions system is immoral and ineffective. It is not helping people into employment and at the same time is leaving vulnerable people on the brink of destitution, without any source of income for long periods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8942a80dcc587662d8373192b3ae4fcda2a348b0/0_200_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6695ca8ede8f4d682adc131f4551da6c","title":"danny cipriani england comeback full back","story":"Danny Cipriani could make his first England appearance under Eddie Jones in the No\u0026nbsp15 jersey after he was named among the full-backs in the squad to face the Barbarians on Sunday. Nathan Hughes will also get the chance to stake a claim for the South Africa tour after he and Cipriani were among six losing Premiership semi-finalists selected in Jones’s 35-man squad.Cipriani won his last England cap in a 2015 World Cup warmup match with an eye-catching cameo against France from full-back and it is a position he often played in his first spell with Wasps. Jones said when he named Cipriani in the touring party as an inside back that “I’ve seen him play 15 well as a younger guy and there’s no reason he couldn’t do that now”, and his selection among the full-backs for Sunday’s match suggests Jones will try him there at some point against the invitational side.Hughes, meanwhile, came through 66 minutes against Saracens on Saturday in his first appearance since sustaining a knee injury during the Six Nations. He was not selected in the 34-man squad to tour South Africa earlier this month but has the chance to prove his fitness to Jones this week and he may benefit from the absence of his 21-year-old Wasps team-mate Jack Willis, who was originally due to go to South Africa before suffering a nasty-looking knee injury on Saturday. Willis’s omission from Monday’ssquad only adds to the likelihood he will miss the tour and with continued question marks over the fitness of Billy Vunipola, Hughes’s hopes of a late call-up to face the Springboks would appear to be strengthened.Elliot Daly and Joe Launchbury are also among the losing semi-finalists added to the squad but will not arrive until Wednesday and Thursday respectively, suggesting they are unlikely to be involved on Sunday. Hughes is due arrive in camp on Tuesday.Marcus Smith is also part of the 35-man group, having also been named on Monday in England’s squad for the World Under-20 Championship which begins in France at the end of the month. The Harlequins fly-half, who is not due to tour South Africa, is among the standout names in the junior squad along with Ben Curry, Ben Loader and Gabriel Ibitoye, who like Smith has been previously called into the senior squad as an apprentice."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6b81036924ca99c15509fbf6fcb6a52f2a880779/364_0_2877_1727/master/2877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0fffdae8c0c8d632d1f22251358e7e15","title":"jos buttler trust instincts england pakistan first test lords","story":"Jos Buttler has admitted he is a luxury in England’s re-fitted Test team and that his return will ide opinion. But as the side’s most potent white-ball weapon prepares for a third stab at the longest format, he says the plan this time is to play on instinct.How Buttler fares in the series with Pakistan that starts at Lord’s on Thursday will make one of the most intriguing subplots during the early Test summer as Joe Root’s side look to return to winning ways after their winter of discontent.Can such a talent, fresh from wreaking havoc as an opener in the Indian Premier League but someone who has not faced a red Dukes ball since the end of last season with Lancashire, really come off as a specialist game changer at No 7?Though not entirely new territory, given the last three of his 18 caps came in the same role during the 2016 tour of India, the 27-year-old is planning a fresh mindset as he looks to repay a significant show of faith from the new national selector, Ed Smith, and Root.“It is a luxury role for a side to have,” said Buttler, before his first training session back. “For me it is about trusting instincts and not fighting them. In the past I have potentially felt as if I had to play in a certain way or be something I am not. So as much as I can I will be trusting my instincts. That is going to be the best way to be successful.”His regret refers chiefly to the 2015 Ashes when, having registered half-centuries in five of his first eight Tests, Buttler went into his shell and appeared to lose the location of his off stump. Two matches into the following winter in United Arab Emirates and he was forced to hand over the wicketkeeping gloves to Jonny Bairstow.Buttler said: “I have learned a lot about myself over the past two years. If you are going to fail, fail in a genuine way and not someone else’s way. It’s going to be a challenge but from the conversations I’ve had with Joe and Ed Smith, it’s very much they want me to play the way that suits me and in the fashion they believe will get the best out of me.”His recall is one in which his perceived ability has trumped his form in this format. Indeed, Buttler was himself surprised when, while waiting for a match between his Rajasthan Royals side and Kolkata Knightriders, and with a record-equalling run of five successive IPL half-centuries behind him, he got the call.So with just four first-class centuries to his name – the last of which came four years ago when newly transferred from Taunton to Old Trafford – and an exclusive diet of white-ball cricket this year, Buttler accepts that some of the county batsmen who had hoped to force their way into the Test team may feel aggrieved.Buttler said: “I’m very aware that I’m the beneficiary of opinions. I don’t know whether there’s a right or wrong. Everyone has an opinion. That’s why sport is so interesting. I’ve been afforded an amazing opportunity to come and play and one that I’m excited about. I am accepting of the noise around it. That’s outside my control.“It shows that people are very open-minded and there’s not only one way in to national selection. If anything that should benefit guys as you can do things your way. Whatever opportunities are afforded to you, you shouldn’t be worried about taking them for risk of saying: ‘If I go and play in a tournament somewhere that’s my red-ball ambitions finished.’”As Root’s side ready themselves for Pakistan, one such tournament is a hot topic of discussion, with the Test players present at Lord’s being briefed in small groups on the England and Wales Cricket Board’s latest thinking regarding The Hundred.Reaction around the county squads has been lukewarm but the hope is that by getting the international cricketers on board – via presentations from the tournament director, Sanjay Patel, and its architect, Mike Fordham – some positivity may trickle down.Asked for his take on the new 100-ball concept, Buttler replied: “People don’t necessarily accept change readily. I’m sure in 2003, when Twenty20 was introduced, it was seen as such a radical move. Gradually, it’s been accepted and has done really well.“There are some fantastic ideas behind The Hundred and what it’s trying to achieve. If it can fulfil those ambitions then it’s going to be great for cricket. If it’s got the best players around the world and the best players in England, I’m sure it’s going to be successful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea5c9edd10142de8da8cdff3b3e18bc2fa290140/136_520_4449_2669/master/4449.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e62089d8d78c158d10dae4b1a22f3e4","title":"own limited edition print sports photographer eamonn mccabe","story":"The award-winning sports photographer Eamonn McCabe, a former  head of photography, looks back at his favourite sporting images from the 1970s and 80s.

I took pictures of nothing and everything surrounding these centenarians from the Montérégie region in Québec, Canada. But one thing kept occurring: every single woman I photographed wanted to groom herself to make sure she would look good in my pictures. This is how it became a story about beauty.I became interested in the efforts that these women put (or didn’t put) into looking beautiful, and the challenges that they face in their old age. I asked them about youth, ageing, feminism, sexuality, charm, appearance, love, and I documented their beauty rituals. Visiting Marie-Berthe Paquette, the woman in the first photograph, was an unbelievable spectacle. She likes to be the center of attention and is willing to do just about everything to make her audience burst out laughing. Every time I visited her, she told me funny stories, sang and danced. In her portrait, she is dancing in a sexy and provocative way for the sake of her audience (myself and two family members). “I personally find myself beautiful, and when I don’t, I do my best anyways! I like to have my hair neatly styled and wear dresses, jewelry and other accessories. I’ve always paid attention to my appearance. In fact, I’m known as la frache (the trendy lady).” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 105 years old, in Montréal, Québec.“I actually care more about beauty today than when I was young. I like to dress rather well, in pretty, simple and practical dresses. I put on foundation and perfume in the morning, lipstick after each meal, and I go to the hairdresser’s every week. I’m also careful not to eat foods that are either too rich or too sweet. It’s important to not let oneself go. I used to enjoy wearing necklaces, but I can no longer attach them, so I gave up.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.To me, the third photo (below) is particularly touching. Laure Saucier, the centenarian in the picture, was very sick and weak but also very peaceful and serene. She didn’t have the energy to move or talk, and even though she used to be a very stylish woman, I doubt she cared about the way she looked any more. But even though Saucier seemed distanced from the physical world, her daughter, Lise Provost, continued to make sure that her mother looked good: that her nails and hair were done and she had jewelry and lipstick on. She knew this used to be important to her mother and wanted to honor her. Since they couldn’t communicate verbally any more, these rituals were their way to stay close together.Through these portraits, shot in 2016, I want to question society’s obsession with youth and beauty standards, and to give a voice to these women whose beauty is rarely acknowledged.“She was very stylish and competitive. She was in love with my father and I think she worried about not being good enough. She always wore lipstick, blush, high heels, earrings, perfume and curled her hair. She’d rub baby oil on herself and bought Madame Avon’s rejuvenating creams. In the evening she went to bed with cotton strips wrapped under her chin and fastened on the top of her head, hoping to lift and tauten her chin and cheeks.” Lise Provost (right) talking about her mother, Laure Saucier (left), in Acton Vale, Québec. Saucier passed away in 2016 at 101 years old.“I definitely find myself as ugly. Beauty fades as we get older. Our noses and ears get bigger, our gait changes, we get hunched backs. Some are worse off than me, but I’m not beautiful at all. Still, I enjoy life and I look forward to the future, even if it’s a short one when you’re 100 years old.” Jeannette Ballard, 100 years old, in Granby, Québec.“When I was young I had long hair, nice legs and curves. Young ladies today all strive to be skinny, but I think that real beauty is natural beauty. We are who we are, and that’s all that matters.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec. Pronovost died in 2017.“The word beauty invokes great classic French authors, and music. When I was young, I always had my nose in a book and I wrote. I don’t mean to brag, but people envied my writing skills. I like Mozart a lot, but it’s Beethoven who really makes my heart sing.” Madeleine Beaugrand Champagneage, 102 years old, in St-Bruno-de-Montarville, Québec. Beaugrand Champagneage passed away in 2017.“Even though we constantly told her that she was beautiful, my mom had always found herself ugly. She often said that she had a monkey face and that she didn’t like her plumpness. My mother regularly dieted. There were stretches where we went without potatoes, bread or desserts. She also tried different weight loss pills. She wore girdles and corsets that she’d buy at Mrs Dinovitzer’s store. I think her weight had always been her biggest fixation.” Provost talking about her mother, Saucier.“When I was young, like all women, I wanted to be attractive. I curled my hair, wore the beautiful outfits my mom made for me and suffered in high heels. Still, I never wore makeup I felt like it was fake. I married my husband because he was handsome, which I ended up regretting. He wasn’t a very good partner and I ended up kicking him out. Rather than maintaining physical beauty, which is vain, I advise young women to cultivate the beauty that surrounds them. You can tend a garden, draw, play music, etc. It’s important to be kind, independent and constantly educate yourself. ” Beaugrand Champagne.“As a young lady, I could not afford to be frivolous. We were poor and had to work all the time. We had to take part in day-to-day chores, pick the raspberries, take care of the babies, cook, help with the harvest, do housework and bathe the children … and all of that without electricity. We didn’t have time to think about beauty.” Solange Racine, 101 years old, in Granby, Québec.“My husband was a very good-looking man. He had beautiful curly hair, and was nicknamed ‘Willy la coche’ (Willy the good-looker). It was very important for him to be always well dressed. When he went out to work at the lumber camp, he’d sell his suit and buy a brand new one when he returned. On the other hand, he was a flirt and a bit fickle: he loved all women and drank too much. But it’s important to be able to forgive.” Anne-Marie Pronovost, 100 years old, in Sutton, Québec.“Of course I’d rather be good-looking rather than ugly! But back when I was young, I couldn’t be bothered with beauty. It was vanity. It was a sin. What really mattered was the family, putting food on the table and making sure that the children were bathed and clothed. I am blessed because my daughter is the one now taking care of me. She welcomed me in her home 20 years ago and I am still there. Family is all that really matters.” Isabelle Gagn (left), 103 years old, in Clermont, Québec, with her daughter (right).“I’m a very rational and level-headed person, and I’m not very sensitive to beauty or art. I come from a very poor family. Spending money at the hairdresser’s or on unnecessary beauty accessories was completely out of the question. I only sewed by necessity. For instance, I made dresses for my sisters using cotton pouches that had been used for storing sugar. Still, I’ve always paid a particular attention to my hair.” Alida Provost, 101 years old, Granby, Québec. Provost passed away in 2016.“My father was a painter and craftsman and he shared his love of art with me. I believe that everything that is artistic is beautiful: theater, picture frames, poems, paintings, flowers, songs. In a person, it’s the character, the silhouette, the smile and the eyes that count. That said, my biggest regret is not getting an education. Doors open for you when you’re educated. Otherwise you feel shame. Regardless of the situation, I would advise young women to educate themselves.” Marie-Berthe Paquette, 102 years old, in Montréal, Québec.Arianne Clément began dabbling in documentary photography while working as a journalist in the Canadian Arctic.

She urged all Muslimsto take leave from work during Ramadan “to avoid negative consequences for the rest of Danish society.”The Finnish Muslim Union chair, Pia Jardi, called the minister’s suggestion “a completely absurd idea,” adding: “There’s no information or statistics to show that bus drivers or other Muslim workers would somehow behave dangerously while fasting. In most Muslim countries, stores and businesses continue operating as normally.”Muslims committed to fasting “have the responsibility to make sure that they get proper rest,” she said.Millions of Muslims around the world began observing Ramadan last week.

His private Boeing jet has not been back to the UK since 1 April. It is uncertain whether the oligarch’s visa woes are temporary and soon to be resolved, or something more permanent akin to a de facto ban. Abramovich has declined to comment. His representatives have said merely, and tactfully, that the process is taking a little longer than usual.Either way, the delay appears to be the result of a new, tougher stance against Russian nationals by the British authorities in the wake of the attempted murder in March of the Russian former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury. Relations between London and Moscow are once again in the deep freeze.The government signalled it was reviewing tier 1 investor visas, given to nearly 700 wealthy Russians between 2008 and 2015. Abramovich is one of them. Other oligarchs – some famous names, some lesser known mid-ranking businessmen – will be wondering if they too can expect visa trouble. Abramovich is vulnerable to British retaliation because of his proximity to President Putin. Their relationship goes back a long way. Abramovich was one of Putin’s early supporters. He recommended him for the top Kremlin job to Boris Yeltsin, when Russia’s ailing leader was looking for a successor.According to the late oligarch Boris Berezovsky in evidence to the high court in London, Abramovich enjoyed significant political influence in Moscow from the second half of the 1990s. In October 1999, he attended Putin’s birthday party. Soon afterwards, Abramovich allegedly bought Putin, then the prime minister, a $50m yacht. “The request came from Mr Putin,” Berezovsky said in evidence.By the time Putin became president in 2000, Abramovich played a key role in shaping the new government, Berezovsky added in his evidence. Abramovich selected members of Putin’s cabinet, he claimed. Abramovich had the power to open and shut criminal cases and to initiate investigations and arrests. it was alleged. He was, in short, a big Kremlin player, albeit one who operated behind the scenes.Abramovich successfully defeated Berezovsky in a subsequent London civil court case and dismisses most of his claims. Still, there is no doubt that Abramovich has friendly relations with Putin. In 2003, Abramovich bought Chelsea football club for £140m. Two years later, he was involved in another larger transaction when he sold his oil company, Sibneft, to state-run Gazprom. He got $13bn. The visa review by the British authorities appears to acknowledge the dual role played by oligarchs in Putin’s system. Oligarchs are entrepreneurs. But they can also be state emissaries. From the Sochi Olympics to this summer’s World Cup, oligarchs have fulfilled requests from the presidential administration, building stadiums, international sporting facilities and Russia’s latest bridge to Crimea.Between 2000 and 2008, Abramovich was governor of Chukotka, a sparsely populated and cold region in Russia’s far east. He transformed the territory with his billions. The Chelsea FC owner has bankrolled Russia’s football union and the national squad. His football academy has built all-weather pitches across the country.Roman Borisovich, a Russian anti-corruption campaigner, described the review of investor visas as a “clever and delicate way” of hitting back at Moscow. Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, has suggested Russian businessmen may now take legal action in the British courts. Borisovich predicts this won’t happen.“The last thing these guys want is to have a public hearing in the UK. They would have to answer questions like ‘how did you make your money’ and ‘are you the real owner of your assets’? Plus ‘are you a conduit for the Russian regime or an instrument for meddling in other countries’? “I would like to see all this in the high court.” Borisovich said the UK government was belatedly abandoning its ‘no questions asked’ policy, something that had made London attractive to Russia’s super-rich. He pointed out that Moscow billionaires did not typically move their factories or production centres to the UK. Rather, they deposited their money here, buying up property that could later be resold.In recent years, Abramovich has kept a low profile, both in Russia and the UK. He was at first surprised by the enormous media attention that accompanied his purchase of Chelsea but got used to it, Russian football pundits say. They add that Abramovich is smart, talented, bright and engaged. His last on-the-record interview appears to have been with the Observer back in 2006. Asked where home was – he has several – Abramovich said: ‘I live on a plane. I like to visit London. If I had to think where I could live if not Moscow, London would be my first choice and second would be New York. In Moscow I feel most comfortable.”“It cannot buy you happiness,” Abramovich said, speaking of money. He added: “Some independence, yes.” Seemingly, however, even a lot of money is no guarantee of a British visa. The question for Abramovich now is whether he decides to tough out the latest period of political turbulence. Or sell Chelsea and retreat to Moscow.

Yet, at the time, his non-appearance at Wembley hardly set the alarm bells ringing.The oligarch has become a sporadic visitor to the club into which he has poured more than £1bn since acquiring it in 2003, missing some significant home games en route and never travelling to away fixtures. While he had attended his side’s loss to Arsenal in last season’s FA Cup final and was regularly seen at Stamford Bridge in the first half of this season, the 51-year-old was last in attendance in his box in the middle tier of the West Stand for the victory over Crystal Palace in March.Flight records suggest his private Boeing 767 was last in London on 1 April but, with Chelsea’s Premier League title defence having petered out before Christmas, and Barcelona having eliminated them from the Champions League a few days after the Palace win, it did not seem particularly surprising that he had chosen to stay away.Nor is it unusual for elite Premier League clubs to be overseen by owners from outside the UK. None of those in charge of the top six is based in this country. Sheikh Mansour and Stan Kroenke own Manchester City and Arsenal respectively, while Joe Lewis and John W Henry are in charge of Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool. United are under the stewardship of the Americans Joel and Avram Glazer. Avram was at Wembley to see his side beaten by Chelsea on Saturday.Regardless, while Abramovich is far from an absentee owner, he has long delegated the day-to-day running of the club to his trusted lieutenants on the ground in London. Principal among them on the football side is Marina Granovskaia, formerly an employee of the oil company Gazprom Neft, who has worked closely with Abramovich for more than 18 years. She had acted as a representative of the owner at the club, and in support of the board of directors, before formally joining the board of Chelsea FC plc in the summer of 2013.Russian-born and a dual Russian and Canadian national, Granovskaia has become increasingly influential at Stamford Bridge, undertaking negotiations over player transfers and contracts, as well as managerial appointments. She assimilated the duties of the team’s technical director into her own following Michael Emenalo’s departure last November, and was at Wembley among the dignitaries from both clubs on Saturday.She is joined on the board of Chelsea FC plc by Eugene Tenenbaum, a Canadian financier who worked as corporate finance chief in Abramovich’s oil business and accompanied the Russian to London in 2003, and the chairman, Bruce Buck, a lawyer by trade. Guy Laurence, previously of Vodafone UK and Rogers Communications, commenced his duties as chief executive in February.Chelsea FC plc’s ultimate parent company is Fordstam Limited, which boasts a debt of around £1.1bn in the form of an interest-free loan from Abramovich, theoretically repayable on 18 months’ notice. The parent company’s money has been ploughed into Chelsea FC plc as equity, and then on to the football club itself – Chelsea Ltd – again as equity. Fordstam informed Companies House on 23 March that it was changing its owner’s residence to “Russia”.Chelsea may have been crowned Premier League champions in 2017, but they have checked the lavish spending of the early Abramovich era in recent times – much to the frustration of the current head coach, Antonio Conte – as they seek to comply with Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations and become less reliant upon the owner’s funds. Some have viewed that as an indication enthusiasm is on the wane for his footballing plaything.In truth, Abramovich continues to pump money into the club – £34m in the 12-month period up to June 2017, for example – and is intent upon redeveloping Stamford Bridge, having been granted planning permission in January 2017 for a £1bn project to increase the stadium’s capacity to 60,000. The anticipated costs have escalated wildly, largely due to the length of time allocated to the build and the complexity of the plans, with Abramovich apparently exploring the possibility of outside investors buying into the redevelopment project."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7840db8ad6261550e26cdf5baf018aa2fbbd1f1b/0_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86cadaa1b3ac19507bcee3693250f454","title":"roman abramovich thought to be caught up in uk visa crackdown","story":"Chelsea owner’s application still being considered after the Russian’s previous visa expiredRoman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea Football Club, could be asked to explain the source of his vast wealth before he is granted a new UK visa.The Russian oligarch’s investor visa application is still being considered after his previous one, which was granted before tighter regulations were introduced in April 2015, expired.No 10 said that while it would not comment on inidual cases, it was the “logical conclusion” that some wealthy iniduals who had applied under the investment visa route before the changes would no longer be eligible.The government launched a further crackdown on wealthy investors coming to the UK after the Salisbury poisoning, increasing tensions between Britain and Russia.Downing Street confirmed it was looking at iniduals who were still in the UK and holding tier 1 visas, which allow anyone who invests more than £2m in the British economy to stay for 40 months.Responding to the reports on the delay with Abramovich’s visa, the Kremlin claimed that Russian businesses often encountered “unfair and unfriendly” actions when applying to come to the UK.But Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “The prime minister has been absolutely clear that our argument is not with the Russian people, our dispute is with the Russian government.”The changes introduced in 2015 mean that Abramovich will face tougher standards when reapplying for his new tier 1 visa, which he will have to do from outside the UK, probably in Russia.Applications can be rejected if officials believe the applicant is not in control of funds, money has been obtained unlawfully, or the origin of funds means granting a visa will not be conducive to the public good.There is no suggestion that Abramovich has been involved in any wrongdoing.Abramovich, who was last seen publicly at a court hearing in Switzerland on Friday, missed Chelsea’s FA Cup final victory over Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday. The Saratov-born businessman has owned the club since 2003.Tier 1 visas are thought to be held by about 700 wealthy Russians.“We are currently taking another look at how the route operates and are undertaking further checks on investors who came to the UK through this route before the reforms were introduced,” a Downing Street spokesman said.No 10 also confirmed additional checks had been taking place at private airfields after the Salisbury attack in March.Abramovich’s visa is thought to have expired in April while he was out of the country and he has not tried to enter Britain since. His new application would have to be made from abroad, which means he will be subject to slightly more rigorous criteria than if he applied from within the UK. Someone who knows Abramovich told the  on Sunday that he had not been denied a visa but it was taking longer than usual to renew, and it was unclear why. A representative for Abramovich declined to comment, calling it a personal matter.Russian officials complained on Monday that the UK was wielding the issuance or denial of visas as a weapon in the growing political standoff between Moscow and London.Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian foreign ministry, told the  in response to a question on Abramovich: “It’s obvious that for the British government both visas and the regulation of the media sphere are instruments of politics.” It is not known where the billionaire is currently. He was last seen in public at the hearing at the district court of Sarine in Fribourg. A representative for Abramovich told the  that he would not comment on his location.Publicly available tracking data showed that a Gulfstream jet believed to be used by Abramovich flew from southern France, where he owns an estate on the Cap d’Antibes peninsula, to Switzerland on Thursday before the court hearing. The same plane returned to southern France on Friday. It has not left since, according to the data. Public tracking data also shows that Abramovich’s luxury yacht, Eclipse, is currently moored off Antibes. His Boeing 767 last flew from Moscow to Nice on 8 May, according to public data from the website FlightRadar24. Chris Bryant, a Labour MP on the foreign affairs select committee, said he regarded the delay in granting Abramovich a visa as “a sign that the card of Putin and his allies is finally being marked”.With the imminent passage through parliament of the sanctions bill, he said it would be possible to put those close to Putin on an open list either for sanctions or visa refusal. “It is best this is done as openly and transparently as possible, with carrots and sticks for good behaviour,” Bryant said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47e241d1fb200009ed9e364c16a22cc6559b441/0_99_1080_648/master/1080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4afedc083b0e10e409840657822b7aef","title":"meet bon and pon the japanese retirees making coordinated outfits cool","story":"Couple have more than 700,000 Instagram followers and are launching their own line in Japanese department store The perfect match: Bon and Pon in picturesWhether they’re standing next to a work of art, against an ocean backdrop or in front of their home, doesn’t seem to matter. The hundreds of thousands of fans who have turned an ordinary Japanese couple into online megastars are really interested in only one thing: what they are wearing.Bonpon511 – otherwise known as Tsuyoshi and Tomi Seki – have attracted a huge following since they started posting Instagram photos of themselves decked out in coordinated clothes in late 2016. But they are not your average Instagram stars. The couple, who are in their 60s, appear almost daily in an array of outfits incorporating similar styles and colours. The simplicity of their sartorial choices has earned them praise from fashion commentators and adoration among their almost 720,000 followers. The playful images, taken with an iPhone mounted on a tripod, also communicate the obvious pleasure they derive from each other’s company, 38 years after the college sweethearts married.A year on from the Yahoo! Japan article that helped their Instagram images go viral, the couple have published two books celebrating married life and have been the subject of numerous articles in Japanese newspapers and magazines.Next month they will launch their own range of clothes and accessories, in collaboration with a designer, at the Japanese department store Isetan Mitsukoshi.They have their daughter to thank for their unlikely celebrity, Tomi told the  from their home in the north-eastern city of Sendai. “She took photos of us and posted them on her own Instagram account. She received lots of comments so suggested that we start our own account.”Their Instagram handle combines their nicknames as children with their wedding anniversary on 11 May, which they marked this year by appearing in Gingham check, accompanied by the familiar hash tags #over60 and #greyhair.They have always had similar tastes in clothes, but it was Instagram fame that prompted them to coordinate more closely, even during lazy days at home and trips to the supermarket.“But it’s not just about coordinating our clothes,” said Tsuyoshi. “We try to choose outfits that complement our surroundings.”Much of their wardrobe comes from Uniqlo and other high street chains – a no-frills approach they believe has contributed to their popularity. “Of course we’re happy to be described as style icons in the media, but that’s not really how we see ourselves. We wear simple, inexpensive clothes that anyone can buy,” said Tomi.Outfits aside, they hope to convince other older couples that retirement should mark the start of a second life – the title of one of their books.“Now we’re on our own and finally have the time to do all the things we didn’t have the time to do when we were raising a family and working,” Tomi said. “We want to show that retirement can be a lot of fun, especially if you find something you enjoy doing together.”The couple met at a festival when they were both students at an art school in Tokyo. Tsuyoshi went on to work in design and marketing, while Tomi chose to stay home with their daughter.Each of their photos attracts tens of thousands of likes and universally upbeat comments in Japanese, English and other languages.“We’re overwhelmed by the number of comments, although we’re unable to understand all of them,” said Tsuyoshi “But we’re extremely grateful to everyone who takes the time to post.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbb266c615c92fe23afb7fdf668ebcc131c10c7a/0_0_1275_765/master/1275.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de2f6d9caacb3780da8633b1a61b54a","title":"north koreas nuclear test site is blowing up punggye ri just for show","story":"North Korea has invited a handful of journalists to watch as it dismantles its only known nuclear test site, but experts warn the move is purely symbolicThis week North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will shut the nation’s only known nuclear test site ahead of an expected meeting with Donald Trump on 12 June. However, experts have warned that the move is more symbolic than practical. Here is all you need to know about the dismantling of Punggye-ri.North Korean leader Kim Jong-un first disclosed plans to close the nuclear test site at Punggye-ri during a summit with South Korean president Moon Jae-in in April. It has been part of a wider charm offensive to portray the regime in Pyongyang as the driver of dialogue and progress. The closing ceremony will take place between 23-25 May, depending on the weather.All of North Korea’s six nuclear tests were conducted at the site under Mount Mantap in the north-eastern interior of the country. The most recent was in September 2017, when Pyongyang claimed to have tested a hydrogen bomb and caused a 6.3 magnitude earthquake that was felt across the border in China.North Korea has invited a handful of journalists to watch the closing ceremony. Notably absent are experts or inspectors who can study the test site up close. The visit will also include a stop in Wonsan, a tourist destination North Korea is hoping to promote to outsiders, a sign the motives behind the invitation are not entirely altruistic.Closing the site will follow a series of steps during the “ceremony”, including “making all tunnels of the test ground collapse by explosion completely blocking entries removing all observation facilities, research institutes and structures of guard units on the ground”, the North’s foreign ministry said in a statement.In the weeks leading up to the decommissioning, several buildings and sheds around the test site were razed, according to satellite images and analysis by monitoring group 38 North. The photos also showed construction of a new structure, which is likely to be a platform to allow visiting journalists to witness the explosions that will shut the entrances to the site.“They had probably done a lot of damage to the site with the last test, so might as well get credit for a tunnel you don’t want to use,” said Vipin Narang, a politics professor who focuses on nuclear proliferation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “They’re also sanitising the site, removing buildings so we don’t know what they did there and making sure no one with technical expertise is able to inspect the area.”A study by Chinese geologists in April said the site had partially collapsed and was perhaps unusable, although Kim appeared to refute those claims, saying there were still two tunnels in good condition.“It is meaningful as a diplomatic gesture, especially since it’s being done in advance of the summit and of having an agreement in place,” said Jenny Town, the managing editor of 38 North. “It also signals to actors like China that provocations are unlikely in the near future, which can help repair relations that have soured over the past year of unrelenting testing. But at the same time, it is still a very small piece of the puzzle that doesn’t affect the North’s core nuclear capabilities or arsenal.“Simply put, they can stop testing because they have finished development and don’t need to test any more. Ultimately, it’s still just a first step down a long and difficult road if true denuclearisation of the peninsula is to be achieved.”Kim is not doing anything that is against his interests in an attempt to placate the US, Narang said, adding he believed the North could have other test sites.But Pyongyang has made it clear it no longer needs the proving ground, with Kim announcing in his New Year speech that the North’s nuclear arsenal was complete.The regime also admitted conducting “subcritical” nuclear tests last month, which allow scientists to test weapons without causing an atomic chain reaction or explosion.Well, kind of. There is a sense of déjà vu among veteran North Korea watchers. A similar spectacle was arranged in 2008, when the North blew up a cooling tower at its Yongbyon nuclear reactor. The symbolic step resulted in sanctions relief and led Washington to remove North Korea from a list of state sponsors of terrorism. But negotiations eventually collapsed and the reactor was used to manufacture nuclear material.

Photograph: Cyril ByrneHowever, Mr Keegan said the council did not have the right to take a judicial review of the board’s decision. The deadline for any party to apply for a judicial review of the case is Tuesday.The board last month granted permission to Crekav Trading for 104 houses and 432 apartments on former playing fields east of St Paul’s College on Sybil Hill Road in Raheny, despite receiving more than 1,000 objections.The application was made under the new Strategic Housing Development “fast track” planning system. This allows applications for schemes of more than 100 homes to be made directly to An Bord Pleanála, bypassing the local authority decision phase.Local authorities, while no longer decision makers for these cases, are required to submit their views to the board. Mr Keegan, on behalf of the council submitted that permission should be refused due to the potential impact on migrating geese, and the loss of playing pitches as a community facility. Mr Keegan has told councillors the board’s decision could have legal implications for the city development plan.“My recommendation, based on planning advice, was the board should not have granted this,” he said.The council will seek legal advice on whether it needs to change the development plan to afford better protection for the green spaces of institutional lands, he said.“The intention is to get legal advice as to what are the implications, and are there any measures we could take to protect the development plan.”However, Mr Keegan said the council had already received legal advice that it did not have “locus standing” or legal standing to take a judicial review of the board’s decision. Several councillors had called for the council to initiate judicial review proceedings against the board.A spokesman for the board said it does not comment on decided cases.Crekav bought the 15 acres of land from the Vincentian Order, trustees of St Paul’s College, for a reported €17 million in 2015. It subsequently applied to the council to build 107 houses and 274 apartments on the land, but withdrew this application to seek a larger scheme through the new fast-track system."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Deadline looms for judicial review over decision to permit 500 homesIf a connection between victim and killer is proven, the murder will seem less random.

The statement has been timed for now as “this week sees us entering into another crucial stage in the Brexit negotiations”, and “time is of the essence as we approach the European Council meeting next month”.In the June 2016 Brexit referendum while the UK voted to leave by 52 per cent to 48 per cent, Northern Ireland voted to remain by a majority of 56 per cent to 44 per cent. Meanwhile, Northern secretary Karen Bradley has promised to seek the best Brexit deal for the North after meetings with businesses about the Border. She visited a cement factory in Co Fermanagh, and met the chief executives of local authorities which adjoin the Border. On Sunday, the UK’s Brexit secretary David Davis and business secretary Greg Clark joined her in Belfast for meetings with 14 organisations as they explored a technological solution to cross-Border trade to minimise the need for any customs checks. Ms Bradley said: “The thing I need to do is get on and do the job to make sure that we get the right Brexit, the right deal for the people of Northern Ireland, and that we continue to build on the United Kingdom and all that we do as a united country.” British prime minister Theresa May has split her ministers into two teams as they work towards a reconciliation on how to manage arrangements with the EU after the exit. Ms Bradley, Mr Davis and Mr Clark are part of a group considering “maximum facilitation”, a solution based on using technology to minimise the need for customs checks after Brexit. Ms Bradley said: “This is really so that I can test how maximum facilitation could be made to work, and whether it can be made to work for Northern Ireland.” Another group established by Mrs May, featuring Brexiteers Liam Fox and Michael Gove and Remain-backing Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, is considering a “customs partnership” whereby the UK would collect tariffs on behalf of the EU without the need for new Border checks.

Photograph: EPAThe Northern Ireland Affairs Committee at Westminster has called on Theresa May’s government to take a more active role in the affairs of Northern Ireland until the devolved institutions there are restored.In a report, Devolution and Democracy in Northern Ireland – Dealing with the Deficit, to be published on Tuesday, the committee also urges an early return to talks to restore the Executive and Assembly.“Karen Bradley is right to make restoring power-sharing devolved government in Stormont her first priority. However, while the political impasse continues the list of policy obstructions and project delays grows and becomes more serious,” committee chair Andrew Murrison said.“We believe the Secretary of State is correct to insist that any decisions from Westminster align with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement. Helpfully, some GFA-compliant guidance already exists. For example, the Hart Report makes policy recommendations that were broadly welcomed across the community.“Elsewhere, the Secretary of State will need to develop stronger ways of engagement and consider new measures to secure adequate scrutiny. Our recommendations include a committee system at Stormont as a temporary expedient pending restoration of the Executive.”Some members of the committee, including Labour’s Kate Hoey and the DUP’s Ian Paisley, have criticised the way the Belfast Agreement operates and the report calls for a consultation between London, Dublin and Belfast on how it might be improved. The report suggests that such a consultation should review how the power-sharing system works and if and how it should be changed.“The Good Friday Agreement has had a transformative effect on Northern Ireland. However, its institutions have collapsed and even if restarted tomorrow would likely remain fragile,” Dr Murrison said.“With the involvement and consent of the whole community in Northern Ireland, we have to consider if they can be more robust and how improvements can be made, as envisaged in the agreement itself. We must investigate every avenue to secure long-term stable government. For political stalemate to become the new normal is unthinkable and unacceptable.”-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3503426.1526927646!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory brexiteers should hope for another election and soon","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSir Ivan Rogers, who resigned as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU in January last year. Photograph: Thierry RogeEPAIt was a long, repetitive exercise that kept the British establishment waiting some of them willing it on, some of them concealing distaste. Bishop Michael Curry’s sermon at the royal wedding was a truer metaphor for Brexit than any journalist has coined these past two years.As the second anniversary of the referendum nears, there is more exasperated checking of watches left to go. A transition period from membership to non-membership will run until the end of 2020. The latest answer to the customs impasse is continuation of the status quo until 2022, when new technologies might fix the problem. By then, the process of exit will rival the second World War in length. If a technical solution does not emerge, Britain’s holding pen could become a permanent home.There is also a new immigration system to decide, as well as the UK’s freedom of manoeuvre on state aid and other regulatory matters. Whatever Britain does in these areas could affect the terms it secures in the trade talks that constitute yet another avenue of negotiation with the EU. In all likelihood, London will be haggling with Brussels over one thing or another indefinitely, much like the Swiss. Ivan Rogers predicted this future when he quit as Britain’s diplomatic emissary to the EU after the referendum.It is not clear that Britain will turn on Brexit as young voters replace old. Demography is not destiny. Even if it were, it is slow to work. All the same, Leavers should worry about the passage of time. The drop in European immigration that is already showing up in data could blunt the public’s main grievance against the EU. Endless negotiations could themselves accustom voters to a kind of rolling semi-membership. If a clean exit is to happen, it has to happen before long.At the risk of riling Brenda of Bristol, the voter whose fatigue at hearing the news of last year’s general election became a viral hit, the best hope for Tory Leavers is another election, and soon. A plan leaked over the weekend envisages a vote of no-confidence in prime minister Theresa May, before an autumn date with the electorate, perhaps under the leadership of Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary and committed Leaver.A new election is not certain to fix the Leavers’ central problem, which is the shortage of parliamentary numbers for their preferred exit. But the potential is there. Two favourable circumstances obtain right now that might not in a few years. One is material. The economy is still growing, with wages rising ahead of inflation. If the business cycle turns before Britain leaves, the animal spirits behind Brexit could weaken. A downturn has the power to frustrate Brexit in a way no human factor can. It is one thing to vote Leave, and another to leave while the economy is fragile.The other tailwind is political. The opposition Labour party still wants to leave the single market. As stable as this seems, Leavers cannot treat it as an immovable fact of politics. They are in parliamentary trouble because the opposition line is already softer than it was at the turn of the year. If it softens much more, a hard exit becomes a fringe prospect.In other words, this apparent rough patch for Leavers is, on second glance, much better than things might be in the near future. The Conservatives are in reasonable shape after the local elections this month. Some voting-intention polls have them ahead. Other surveys show that voters trust them over other parties to negotiate exit.Most Tories dismiss the weekend speculation out of hand. A snap election seems implausible. But the same was true five minutes before May called one last spring, at which point such insurmountable barriers as the Fixed Term Parliaments Act were breezily surmounted. Given the delicate balance of forces in the House of Commons right now, it would take a small shift in their favour to smooth the way to a clean exit.The Eurosceptic dread was never a formal annulment of the decision to leave. No government could do such a thing without inciting half the nation. Their real nightmare is a prolonged exit that ultimately obscures the difference between leaving and staying. This explains their impatience to leave now, and to elect a parliament to that end.On the balance of probabilities, they will fail. May should see out the year, and the process of exit. But that balance is finer than generally believed, and liable to change with events. The parliamentary deadlock is real. The answer is the long grass or to consult the country. Voters who were not exasperated by last year’s election might yet have their patience tested with a fifth major democratic event in as many years.

How will we, the public, respond as the Duchess of Sussex steps into her royal shoes? And how long will it be before our applause for the former Ms Markle’s grace and composure – the cry that “she’s a natural” – give way to a lament that she’s “such an actress”? Because make no mistake, for all the rapturous post-wedding praise, the backlash, if it hasn’t already started rumbling, is certainly about to begin....To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeView all subscription options\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp|LoginPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePlease review our commenting policyInside the royal wedding evening receptionMeghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding speeches: The most moving lines and best jokesNottingham Cottage: The Kensington home where Meghan and Harry live as a married coupleRoyal wedding latest news: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry delay honeymoonWhat is \u0026#39laze\u0026#39, the latest deadly threat generated by Hawaiian volcano? Transgender brain scans promised as study shows structural differences in people with gender dysphoriaUS Justice Department launches probe of FBI tactics used in Trump 2016 campaign investigationSir Anthony Hopkins: \u0026#39Am I a grandfather?

Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said the government’s initiative was “nowhere near enough”.He said: ”Schools in disadvantaged areas frequently face extremely challenging circumstances, struggling to recruit and retain teachers and leaders, and too often labelled as failing by a draconian accountability system which stigmatises them.“Schools cannot on their own turn round deeply entrenched disadvantage. These communities also need social and economic programmes which support families and provide more opportunities for secure, well-paid employment. Their young people need to believe they can succeed.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars. And the jets have been seen before.But a new study shows the first time that they have captured the hot flare that comes out just afterwards. And the flare and then swallowed star have not been linked together beforeA British scientist has uncovered the fossil of a dog-sized horned dinosaur that roamed eastern North America up to 100 million years ago. The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in AsiaBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the studyLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.Earth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occurScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”Illustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.One might have thought that, due to their high population numbers and wide geographic distribution, humans might have led to greater genetic ersity than other animal species, said Dr David Thaler of the University of Basel.At least for mitochondrial DNA, humans turn out to be low to average in genetic ersity.Scientists have suggested that low genetic variation within humans is the result of us all arising from a relatively recent expansion from a small population that quickly spread around the world.The new research suggests that similarly low variation is seen in most other animals as well, suggesting the same kind of phenomenon has likely shaped the genetics of other species. Most creatures, the scientists said, are relatively “young”.First birds had beaks with teeth, prehistoric fossils showAround 99 per cent of animals that have ever lived are now extinct, and the researchers argued this relentless pace of extinction keeps culling species, while evolution drives constant change. Life is fragile, susceptible to reductions in population from ice ages and other forms of environmental change, infections, predation, competition from other species and for limited resources, and interactions among these forces, said Dr Thaler.The similar sequence variation in many species suggests that all of animal life experiences pulses of growth and stasis or near extinction on similar time scales.At a time when humans place so much emphasis on inidual and group differences, maybe we should spend more time on the ways in which we resemble one another and the rest of the animal kingdom,” said Mr Ausubel.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We had a celebration for the prince. There were many, many pigs. We had many, many people come who wanted to celebrate.”Strange island: Pacific tribesmen come to study BritainWith the atmosphere further lifted by kava, a drink made from a plant root said to have sedative and mood-enhancing qualities, the celebration seems to have been even more joyous than those for the duke’s 89th birthday on June 10 2010.That was when it had been prophesied that Prince Philip would come to Tanna to be with his people, living in a hut and hunting wild pigs with them.The slight disappointment that the dukeMessiah was a no-show on that occasion was mitigated by the fact that British gap year student Marc Rayner, 18, was on hand to act as a stand-in.As a stickler for protocol, the duke would doubtless have been glad to hear that Mr Rayner adopted formal dress by wearing a nambas, a slightly more extensive version of the penis sheaths that Tanna men wear in everyday life.“They are a wonderful people and I didn’t want them to feel let down,” said Mr Rayner.  “I stepped in to explain that the prince\u0027s many responsibilities prevented him from visiting in person - but that he would one day rest in spirit on the island.”As it is, however, although Tanna is the home of the so-called “cargo cult” known as the Prince Philip Movement, the duke – in bodily, if not spirit form – has never set foot on the island, one of 82 in the Vanuatu archipelago.The closest he came was in 1974, when he visited the Vanuatu capital Port Vila on the royal yacht Britannia with the Queen.Chief Jack Naiva, one of the paddlers of a traditional war canoe which greeted the royal yacht, was quoted as saying: I saw him standing on the deck in his white uniform. I knew then that he was the true messiah.Tanna elders later sent Prince Philip a nal nal hunting club.  He sent them back a picture of himself holding the club.  The photo has become a cherished religious icon on Tanna.In the village of Yaohnanen there is a sort of shrine to the duke, with a Union Flag draped over framed photographs of the Queen’s consort.Last year’s announcement that he would be retiring from public life did nothing to dampen the people of Tanna’s devotion to him.Jimmy Joseph Nakou told reporters from the Associated Press that it was still the custom for villagers in Yaohnanen and Yakel to gather every evening, drink kava, and pray to Prince Philip.“We ask him to increase the production of our crops in the garden, or to give us the sun, or rain,” he said.  “And it happens.“Here in Tanna, we believe that Prince Philip is the son of our god, our ancestral god, who lives up in the mountain.Top gear: William and Kate had an Aston Martin with balloons and a JUST WED number plate.

But the cults reflect quite logical and rational attempts to make sense out of a social order that appears senseless and chaotic.”  He outlined how South Pacific populations with “highly developed cultures” had been subjected to “enormous social stress and strain” by the arrival of Europeans with “cargo” – Pidgin English for trade goods – and frightening technological power.With the 19th Century traders came missionaries, who thought it would be clever to try to make Christian ideas like the Second Coming more palatable by tacking them on to existing South Pacific beliefs.The result, however, seems to have been that instead of Christinaity, beliefs grew up that a local hero or god would come to initiate paradise on Earth and bless the people of the South Pacific with the riches of the white man’s cargo.Worsley explained that the seizure of islanders for work on the plantations of Australia and Fiji left them disinclined to swallow whole the missionaries’s teachings: “The splendid vision of the equality of all Christians began to seem a pious deception in face of the realities of the colour bar, the multiplicity of rival Christian missions and the open irreligion of many Whites.“They found that acceptance of Christianity did not bring the cargo any nearer. They grew disillusioned.”Prince Philip asks \u0027Is that a terrorist?\u0027 after seeing bearded manPrince Philip believed in nuclear disarmament, letters revealPrince Philip \u0027told Blair’s team to f*** off’ over Diana’s funeral96 Prince Philip gaffes in 96 yearsThen the Second World War came to the Pacific.On Vanuatu the appearance of so many troops and so much US military hardware seems to have boosted the “John Frum Movement” that had begun in the 1930s, and was still going strong in 1960 when David Attenborough visited to be told about a Messiah figure: “’E look like you. ‘E got white face. ‘E tall man. ‘E live ‘long South America.”On Tanna, the John Frum Movement seems to have morphed into the Prince Philip Movement some time in the 1950s or 1960s.One theory is that people on Tanna noticed the respect with which British colonial officials spoke of the Queen, and aligned Prince Philip with their traditional belief that the son of the mountain god would travel over the sea, marry a powerful woman and eventually return to his people.  One Tanna elder has suggested that the Prince Philip Movement will not die with him but be passed on to his children, and his children\u0027s children (Getty Images  WPA Pool  Pool)And at the time the duke\u0027s retirement, it was also suggested that the Prince Philip Movement would not die with him.Tanna elder Chief Tom Numake was quoted as saying: “Just because he has retired, it doesn\u0027t just stop.“It will be passed on to his children, and if they have children then it will continue on through them. The followers don\u0027t just see it as Prince Philip but that it will continue going on through the bloodline.Which does now rather suggest that in the unlikely form of Prince Harry, Meghan Markle has just got herself hitched to a husband who might one day, just possibly, come to be seen, as the Messiah, not a very naughty boy. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

He is still wearing his Dr Martens and his ceremonial chain.“It’s a good accessory,” he smiles.Asked how he feels about the global reaction to his now famous official inauguration photo, Councillor Magid Magid’s response is as unorthodox as the image itself.Lord Mayor of Sheffield Magid Magid (Chris Saunders)“Mate… f*****g hell…” he tells The Independent, still apparently struggling for words. “It’s been surreal. Mad. I wasn’t expecting any of this.”The 28-year-old’s election as the South Yorkshire city’s official first citizen last week made headlines around the world. He has received messages of goodwill from people as far and wide as New York and Syria. ITV News anchor Charlene White declared on Twitter that she might be “a little bit in love”.This is partly because of who he is and what he’s achieved. Councillor Magid is not only the city’s youngest ever lord mayor – and the first from the Green Party – he is also a Muslim former Somalian refugee who arrived in the UK at the age of five, unable to speak English.And it is partly because of that picture. In it, amid the shadowy, gilded confines of Sheffield’s Victorian Town Hall, he squats – complete with ceremonial chain, Dr Martens boots and wide-eyed smile – high on a balustrade.‘If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done’That Councillor Magid – who once appeared on Channel 4 reality show Hunted – is different there is no doubt.He was elected here after being nominated by his three Green Party council colleagues. When I later ask one, Alison Teal, why they put him forward, her response is simple. “He’s charming and magnetic,” she says. “I’ve never met anyone who doesn’t like him. He’s a born lord mayor.”The main message he wants to get across during his year in post is one of inspiring others.“If me doing this – as a black, Muslim immigrant – can spark someone to go out and change their bit of the world, that’s my job done,” he says. “That, and to get people talking about Sheffield, about what a brilliant, erse city it is.”The strange story of Sheffield’s tree massacreAt his inauguration, he entered the chamber to Star Wars music and thanked his mum for “putting up with all my shit” growing up.“I was a handful,” he explains today. “Typical teenager. The important thing was thanking my mum because she’s the reason I’m here, her courage and determination for a better life.”It was his mother, Amina Deria, indeed, who took young Magid – along with his older sister Hanan Mah – out of war torn Burao in northern Somalia. After six months in an Ethiopian refugee camp, they arrived in the Burngreave area of Sheffield where she worked as a cleaner.“To me,” he says, “it’s always been home.”He did well enough at school and, after some time out in which he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, went to the University of Hull to study marine biology. There, he was elected president of the students’ union.“I cared about issues but I was pretty naive about politics,” he says. “I remember a hustings, someone asked if I was going to join a picket line. I was thinking: ‘What the fuck is a picket line?’ But I gambled and said, ‘Yeah, of course I am’, and there was a round of applause.”Around 2015, alarmed by the rise of Ukip and anti-immigration rhetoric, he joined the Greens back in Sheffield where he was working in digital marketing. He was elected to the city council a year later.“This rising xenophobic language affects me and my loved ones,” he explains. “There’s that expression that if you don’t do politics, politics will do you. I just felt I couldn’t sit on the sidelines and let that language go unchallenged. It legitimises racism and it needs to be tackled. I wanted my voice in the debate. Local politics was a way to do that.”Among his main beliefs are devolved local power, free education, an end to PFI and the creation of a republic.Now, as lord mayor, he will, as convention dictates, act as a city figurehead. “I had a white tie dinner last night,” he tells me. “I went to hire the suit – £120! I was saying: ‘I want to hire it, not buy it.’”But he plans to open the role up too. He promises to go to more events involving underrepresented communities, and wants magicians and musicians to perform in council meeting intervals – as a way of encouraging more people to interact with local democracy.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesMarcio and Andreia Gomes, parents of Logan Gomes, arrive for a commemoration hearing at the opening of the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster, in London.Brackley Town celebrate after winning The Buildbase FA Trophy Final after they beat Bromley on penalties at Wembley Stadium.Actress, Meghan Markle, reaches Prince Harry at the altar in St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle for their wedding service.Workers from the Covent Garden branch of TGI Fridays on a picket line outside the restaurant as they strike in a dispute over pay.

The tragedy is the price the country will pay for Labour’s failure to lead.”The warning comes as a succession of polls show the Conservatives edging ahead of Labour, despite their deep Brexit isions and a sluggish economy.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesBrexit threatens life on the Irish border: in picturesJohn Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Only a very small minority of people took us up on the offer and came forward with extra evidence. Overall, giving people extra time did not increase their likelihood of providing evidence.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This is impossible, and the far more likely reason is painfully filing down the teeth to stop the dolphins biting trainers and tourists.”An orangutan appears frustrated by his cage (World Animal Protection)Because members of the public have previously complained about the venue, taking photographs and videos there is banned, the report authors said.In the wild, dolphins use their teeth to establish dominance through “raking” other animals, leaving superficial marks. Some researchers believe a dolphin’s teeth may play a role in its ability to absorb and detect sound.Tourists pay to swim with dolphins in Indonesia and elsewhere, being towed by holding on to the animal’s fin – but swimmers are unaware the extra weight may damage the fin, the report says.It describes how the investigators saw dolphins – originally illegally caught from the wild – kept in pools much too small for their needs. The pool housing the animals whose teeth were missing measured 32ft x 65ft and 10ft deep and had four bottlenose dolphins living in it.Campaigners at the animal-protection charity say that while Bali may be a paradise island for holidaymakers, it is a hotbed of misery for the 1,500 wild animals believed to be captive there in the tourism industry.The investigators studied 26 attractions, and concluded that not one of them met the animals’ basic needs.And four in five venues with monkeys and orangutans failed to meet their basic needs.Among the disturbing cases they filmed were:An elephant limping, possibly because of a broken legAn elephant forced at riflepoint to lie downAn orangutan trying to get away from a visitor and being pulled backAn orangutan frustrated by being cagedPeople lifting a turtle by its shellMacaques chained at the neckIndonesia is one of the world’s fastest growing travel destinations, and the country’s government is pushing the industry hard, with the aim of doubling visitor numbers to 20 million by 2019.Bali is increasingly popular with British holidaymakers, with a 14 per cent increase in numbers last year to 243,000, making them the fifth most numerous tourists in the country. Visitors often include couples getting married or honeymooners wanting a taste of the exotic.Swimming with dolphins, elephant rides, taking selfies with orangutans and circus-style animal shows are all rising in popularity, but campaigners are calling on them to boycott Bali’s attractions featuring captive animals.Tigers housed in a small concrete enclosure (World Animal Protection)The report, entitled Wildlife Abusement Parks, reveals how orangutans, tigers, civets and even young lions were kept in filthy, cramped conditions with concrete floors, and deprived of food before shows to force them to carry out “tricks” for entertainment.Orangutans used for tourists’ selfies had no “freedom of movement, opportunities for social interaction or stimulating activities”.Dolphins forced to break into nets to find food due to overfishingElephants that had suffered a “cruel and intensive” training process that involves severe pain were used for giving rides. The study says: “Tourists who enjoy interacting with captive wild elephants, or watching them perform seemingly harmless acts such as painting are not aware of the severe suffering  that lies beneath.”The highly traumatic experience will stay with the elephant for ever, it says, adding: “Many tourists incorrectly presume that elephants are docile animals, a story which many elephant entertainment venues are keen to spread. These ‘gentle giants’, however, are one of the most dangerous  wild animals to handle. The number of people severely injured by captive wild elephants is estimated to be the highest rate among captive wild animals used by people.”Many elephants at Bali’s tourist venues displayed abnormal repetitive behaviour – including swaying and foot-shuffling – a sign of distress and suffering.Ms Vitali said: “Our research shows many people go to animal spectacles because they’re interested in animals and out of love for animals, but the vast majority are unaware of the welfare violations behind these places.“Many venues portray themselves as sanctuaries when really they’re exploiting animals.“The websites of some of these places talk about a resident herd of elephants living peacefully, which looks idyllic but what you don’t see is the elephants are chained, placed in a field without food, water, shade or chance to communicate – the opposite of in the wild where they have close family structures.“No one wants to think in the background of their wedding photos is a herd of suffering animals.”Steve McIvor, chief executive of World Animal Protection, said: “It’s a tragedy that Bali, such a beautiful destination for tourists, forces its captive wild animals to endure such grotesque and horrific conditions.“Behind the scenes, wild animals are being taken from their mothers as babies or bred in captivity to be kept in filthy, cramped conditions or repeatedly forced to interact with tourists for hours on end.”The Balinese economy relies on its millions of tourists, he said. “Sadly, until Bali improves animal welfare at these dreadful venues, World Animal Protection is urging UK tourists to avoid them.If you can ride, hug or have a selfie with wild animal, then it’s cruel – don’t do it, no matter how many ‘likes’ it will get on social media.“We’d also encourage holidaymakers to boycott the travel companies that promote and support these appalling establishments.”The Independent has asked the Bali Tourism Board to comment.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

US investigators have accused Mr Najib\u0027s associates of stealing and laundering $4.5bn (£3.3) from the fund, some of which allegedly landed in Mr Najib\u0027s bank account and was used to buy a $23m pink diamond necklace for his wife. Ms Rosmah is known for her lavish spending on designer handbags, watches and jewellery when she travels abroad. Mr Najib’s critics have previously accused his wife of financing her expensive shopping habit with public funds.Mr Singh declined to say who the raided apartment belonged to but he confirmed that the search was “conducted in relevance to our 1MDB investigations. Anti-corruption police also carried out simultaneous raids at several other locations, including his former office as prime minister, an official residence and Mr Najib’s own home, where police seized more handbags and clothes following a 20-hour search.  Mr Singh said police were trying to crack open a safe in Mr Najib’s house.  Police search former prime minister Najib Razak\u0027s home in Kuala Lumpur as part of a corruption probe after billions of dollars were siphoned off from a state fund (REUTERSLai Seng Sin)Mr Najib has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer denounced the long search at his home as harassment.The police raid marks an extraordinary turn of events a week after Mr Najib’s coalition was defeated in a general election he was expected to win – putting an end to the coalition\u0027s 60-year rule. After leading an opposition alliance to victory in the 9 May election, the new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad re-opened the investigation into the state fund’s missing money. The 92-year-old, who was once Mr Najib’s mentor, was prime minister for 22 years until 2003.

He recalls the pressures organising LGBT football games in regional cities, only to see them cancelled at the last minute. He recalls the phone calls from security services, and numerous other such incidents.But, according to Mr Agapov, the authorities have seemingly undergone a total conversion in time for this summer’s World Cup. Under the watchful eye of Fifa, Russia’s bureaucrats are, apparently, now fully signed up to the principles of tolerance and non-discrimination. For one month at least, Russia’s “traditional values” are being put to one side, and the most pernicious interpretations of a 2013 law banning “propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations among minors” forgotten. World Cup 2018 squad guide: Latest news and updates ahead of RussiaOfficial statements have been bold enough. The Russian Football Union’s Alexei Smertin, a World Cup ambassador, said there would be no bans on rainbow flags or same-sex partners showing affection. “You can kiss all you like, and hug one another, within the bounds of normal reason,” he has said.

But in comments to The Independent, he was strangely non-committal. He claimed that Russian supporters would never do such things as show rainbow flags in stadia. But it was not up to him to tell officials like Mr Smertin what the Russian policy should be. And he would not be staging any personal protest either.  Reverting to his usual discriminatory language, almost as an afterthought, Mr Milonov added: “We have never persecuted people on account of their Satanic sexual perversions.”  World news in picturesWorld news in picturesNewly appointed Catalan president Quim Torra arrives to visit jailed Catalan separatist politicians at the Estremera jail near Madrid.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro casts his vote during the presidential elections in Caracas.

A vibrant gay scene exists in many of its major cities, and its younger generation is more tolerant. But several years of state-sponsored homophobia have had an effect on the general population. Since the controversial 2013 anti-gay law was passed, the number of recorded hate crimes has doubled. Polls also indicate a growing intolerance of LGBT communities. In more lawless corners of the Russian Federation, the situation is uglier. Last year, credible reports emerged from the largely Muslim republic of Chechnya suggesting more than 100 men were tortured on account of their sexuality. At least three died many are still missing. Alexander Kondakov, a researcher at St Petersburg’s Centre for Independent Social Research, said the tournament has the makings of a toxic cocktail. “You have a tournament celebrating hyper-masculinity taking place in a country where the government is actively supporting hatred with rhetoric and legislation,” he said. “Then you add alcohol into the mix.”Violence against LGBT supporters was not only possible but likely, he added. According to Mr Kondakov, Russian activists have welcomed the Kremlin’s discovery of LGBT rights. But there are few illusions that it will lead to a change in direction, or a new inclusive or positive agenda. “The rare positive steps we see usually end with the most ordinary of homophobia,” he said. Indeed, far from providing a springboard for local LGBT rights, the World Cup has arguably played into anti-gay propaganda, said Mr Agapov. “By emphasising the safety of foreign LGBT fans, authorities have managed to present homosexuality as something foreign, un-Russian,” he said. “Clearly, they will do everything to make sure the World Cup passes trouble-free, but when it does the discrimination, the homophobia, and the laws will remain.” or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The two had been lovers after meeting in 1960 when being gay was banned.Scott, who worked as a model, was said to have had a full blown affair with the politician and even had liaisons in Thorpe’s Commons room.But after they parted, Thorpe was said to have viewed Scott as a dangerous blackmailer intent on revenge - something that could have wrecked his political ambitions.For while homosexuality was legalised in 1967 it was still taboo for people in the public eye.Scott had been lured on to Exmoor by a hitman, who was allegedly a part-time pilot called Andrew Newton who had been hired as part of the plot.He shot the model’s dog before turning the gun on Scott – but it jammed. Effing and jeffing, he sped off.After managing to hail down an approaching car, Scott blurted “Jeremy Thorpe” to the driver.A police investigation lead to a trial in the Old Bailey with the Liberal leader accused of conspiracy to murder along with three other men. But the jury did not feel convinced that Thorpe, a man of hitherto unblemished reputation and a national figure with a very distinguished public record could be capable of the crime.

But we have also watched him grow up.He is no longer the pampered prince surrounded by chinless sycophants, who got it horribly wrong at fancy dress parties and Las Vegas swimming pools.He has grown into an Afghan war veteran, a doer of genuinely good works that make a real difference to lives that have been shattered by combat.He has grown into the son that Princess Diana would have been incredibly proud of.Twenty years on from the death of Diana, this country desperately wants Harry’s life to have a happy ending.A wedding — even a royal wedding — is not the same as a marriage, of course. And a day — even a special day like yesterday in Windsor in the blazing sunshine — is not the same as building a successful relationship that endures a lifetime.But the wedding of Prince Harry to Meghan Markle felt like the start of Harry’s happy ever after.Many of us, I suspect, were caught off guard by the raw emotion of the day. Hardened old hacks who have covered their share of royal events do not usually shed a tear among all that pomp and circumstance.But it is 20 years since I watched William and Harry mourn their mother in Westminster Abbey, and I saw them grieve when the cameras were pointed away. And I could not watch this wedding without a lump in my throat. And I suspect there were millions like me.Windsor is not really built to host the wedding of the century. This ancient market town is more used to low-key royal nuptials — Charles marrying Camilla and Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones — and having Meghan and Harry’s wedding in the shadow of that 1,000-year-old castle was like ­throwing the Rio carnival in a telephone booth.But it worked. This was Woodstock for royalists, whatever part of the world they came from.The mood was good-humoured, stoic, polite and it all felt fantastically British. A lot of people brought their dogs.And there were Americans everywhere, like Fulvia Brooks, 52, of Washington DC, visiting the UK for the first time.“As an African-American, and a woman, and an American, this day means a lot to me,” Fulvia told me. “Most of all it means love is real.”Her sister Julietta Simmons, 54, said: “I wanted to be a part of history. And it’s amazing! Wonderful! Yeah!”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKHarry and Meghan have lit a fire under the special relationship. There are 1,000 graduates of Meghan’s old university, Northwestern of Chicago, living in the UK and it felt like most of them had come to Windsor.“She is a smart, powerful, sophisticated woman,” said Ellen Bencard, a Northwestern alumna. “She is going to be able to do so much.”Some things about the crowds were unchanging, such as the presence of servicemen and women, the backbone of these events. But this was noticeably a different crowd from William and Kate’s wedding in 2011.There were more black faces, more brown faces, and more of a sense the entire nation felt included in a way they never did in the past.“She will modernise the Royal Family,” said Val West of Staines, Surrey. “There are millions of us who have been living in mixed-race families for years. The Windsors have joined us in the 21st century.”The last time an American divorcee married into the Royal Family, the British monarchy had a meltdown.This time, it might be the American divorcee who saves them.But you had to wonder if Meghan Markle TRULY understands what she’s getting into. She will be scrutinised like no other woman for the rest of her life.The fact she is 36 and has had a life — Diana was 19 when she wed Charles and died at 36 — will hold her in good stead, as will marrying a man clearly crazy about her.But there will be unimaginable pressure on Meghan to keep smiling, to keep hugging, to make the fairytale come true and — oh yes — produce a baby before she turns 40. So, even on this happiest of days, you had to fear for the bride.Because on Saturday we watched a once-obscure actress cement her place as without ­question the most famous woman on the planet.And you have to worry, just a ­little, about Harry. Like his brother, Harry sometimes seems a tad sulky about the constant, never-ending interest in his life.Behind the charming smiles, the younger royals too frequently seem to lack the stoic sense of duty the Queen has displayed for a lifetime, as though being born into the Royal Family is a heavy burden — when of course it is also a fantastic privilege.And you can’t dream of the quiet life when you just married the Grace Kelly of the 21st Century, a woman who blends regal charisma with Hollywood va-va-voom like nobody else alive. But this was not a day for nagging doubts.This was a day for believing Meghan and Harry will have the happy-ever-after they deserve, that the boy and girl from broken homes will build a home that lasts.The build-up to this special day has been difficult.Arranging your wedding day is never easy when you come from a dysfunctional, divorce-riven family full of bat-crazy relatives — and that’s just Harry!But thoughts of the sad past melted away in the sunshine. In 1947 Churchill called the Queen’s wedding “a flash of colour on the hard road we travel”.Windsor on Saturday made you believe we have not changed as much as we may have feared. The last was George V when he married Princess Victoria Mary of Teck at St James’s Palace in 1893.Harry had to get special permission from the Queen to keep his facial hair.As he is no longer a serving officer, Her Majesty had to give the OK for him to wear his military uniform.Since it is customary to be clean-shaven when in uniform, it is believed that her permission also covered Harry’s facial fuzz.Historian Hugo Vickers said: “Theoretically the Army don’t like it.”Along with brother Wills, Harry was in the frock coat uniform of the Household Cavalry’s Blues and Royals.They were hand-tailored by royal outfitters Dege and Skinner, of Savile Row in central London.A Royal Crown on his shoulder indicated Harry has been promoted to Major since leaving the Army as a Captain in 2015.He would have had the honour bestowed on him by The Queen, who can promote members of the Royal Family in line with their peers because they hold military appointments.On his left chest Harry displayed his Pilots’ Wings, awarded when he served with the Army Air Corps as an Apache helicopter pilot.His medal ribbons were the Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order Afghanistan with rosette The Queen’s Golden Jubilee and Diamond Jubilee. These were our people on the streets of Windsor. Men like Ray Brown, dressed as Uncle Sam — his friend Janet Butterfield was in a Union Jack dress — who had travelled all night from Yorkshire to cheer on the Long Walk.And Grace Gothard, from London out of Ghana, who wore a homemade dress she wore to Kate and William’s wedding.And you had to admire their patriotism, their good-natured humour, the quiet fortitude it took to be on those streets for hours.And this is our country, you realised, the real country that exists beyond the soft, sneering elite in Westminster. These decent, patriotic, polite people who are so often ignored are the best of us.We are often told this country is bitterly and permanently divided.But on Saturday in the spring sunshine of Windsor, it felt like those cheering crowds held up a mirror to the nation’s soul. And we did not seem divided at all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She stormed: “I remember Diana, the Princess of Wales taking her young sons out at night to see the street-sleepers.“This week we have had stories of Windsor’s street cleaners cleaning the street homeless, who had their possessions compounded, while keen monarchists sleep out in their clothes so they can cheer on the Royal parade.“I can’t believe she would have remained silent on £30m spent on security for a Royal carriage ride around Windsor while street homeless are so cruelly displaced.”And pointing out that Kensington is the joint poorest ward in London and that their health is getting worse, she added: “what does her youngest son think of that?”The Kensington MP, whose constituency covers Grenfell tower, accused the Royals of not doing enough to help those affected by the tragic blaze which killed 71 people last summer.Ms Dent Coat said it was a “lovely idea” to use the hundreds of rooms in Royal palaces to house the homeless.It is estimated that the Royals help Britain take in £500m every year in tourism revenues from their estates and buildings.And they spend their time helping dozens of deserving charities, including Help for Heroes, organising the Invictus Games and promoting mental health campaign Heads Together.Ms Dent Coad sparked uproar last September for pouring scorn on Prince Harry’s military record – saying “Harry can’t actually fly a helicopter”.Speaking at a fringe event at Labour Party conference, she said: “He tried to pass the helicopter exam about four times and he couldn’t get through it all – so he always goes for the co-pilot. So he just sits there going ‘vroom vroom’.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, Harry’s acted.They all talked about modernising the Royal Family. Harry has actually done it with a bride and a wedding service like no other.“Love,” Bishop Curry told us in his extraordinary sermon — which spoke in accents unheard of in polite English churches — “love can change this world.”It’s sure changed the Royal Family. Ms Markle, it is worth repeating, is mixed-race, American, of uncertain religion, an actress, divorced and with a sexual history.In the past any one of these would have rendered her deeply doubtful as a royal bride and the combination would have ruled her out entirely. But the times they are a’changing.The stigma of divorce was still powerful as late as the 1990s, which is why it took so long to dissolve the disastrous marriage of Harry’s parents, Prince Charles and Princess Diana.But their divorce, and Charles’s subsequent remarriage to Camilla, acted as a sort of earthquake which brought all the remaining conventions of royal marriages — virginal brides, nice English girls, no divorce — tumbling down.Which, in a nutshell, is how the Royal Family came to get Meghan.But why did Meghan want to become royal? The short answer is that she wanted Harry. But so did lots of other women, who all baulked at the prospect of becoming royal.Not Meghan. Indeed, she seems to have embraced it as passionately as Harry himself.As an actress, of course she wasn’t fazed by the publicity that had so put off Harry’s earlier girlfriends. But there’s more to it than that.At university she took a double major in theatre and international studies — which was her real love.She became an intern in the American embassy in Argentina. She took the exam to enter the US State Department, which is the equivalent of our Foreign Office.It was only when she failed the notoriously difficult test that she turned to acting.Moreover, the moment she enjoyed success and fame with Suits, she used it to leverage her entry on to the international stage as “Global Ambassador” for World Vision Canada, among many other good causes.In other words, acting was not her vocation. It was only a means to an end.And that end is much better served by her marrying Harry, becoming royal and using her fame — and his — to serve the issues, particularly women’s issues, she is so keen on.So you could say that Harry — the eternal boy-man — is marrying his mother, since Diana used her fame too.But Diana did it in opposition to her estranged husband. Meghan aims to do it in partnership with Harry and at the very heart of the Royal Family.And she’s proving astonishingly adept — is it those actressy skills again? — at winning over the British establishment.Back in the 1930s, the Archbishop of Canterbury was the deadly foe of Wallis Simpson, King Edward VIII’s divorced American bride, and led to his abdication.Today, Archbishop Justin Welby is Meghan’s best friend. Indeed, he’s practically three in a bed with the couple.There’s chemistry, of course. But there’s also calculation on both sides.Welby wants to use Meghan, who as an American does religion as well as touchy-feely, to spearhead a religious revival among the young.The Royal Family also want to buy into her as an international brand.Which is why the Queen appointed Harry Commonwealth Youth Ambassador.Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKKeeping the Commonwealth going in the face of the overwhelming indifference of British politicians of all parties has been the greatest personal achievement of the Queen’s long reign.And she capped it by ruthlessly stage-managing Charles’s acclamation as her successor as Head of the Commonwealth at the most recent Commonwealth Conference.That was the constitutional bit sorted out.Harry’s appointment addresses the equally important question of PR.Meghan and Harry are the model modern couple: Mature (well, she is), bi-racial,bi-cultural, international, do-gooding, fashion-conscious and media-savvy to their fingertips.They are the perfect face of a modern monarchy at home and ideal Global Ambassadors for Brand Windsor abroad.And, come to think of it — which I’m sure the Queen and her advisers have done — they are the perfect Global Ambassadors for post-Brexit Brand Britain as well.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Nobody would believe that.Yet the happy couple set aside family rows, petty jealousies and drunken sabotage and basked in the warm embrace of an adoring public.Windsor’s Disney-style ceremony was watched in broad daylight north of the equator and the middle of the night Down Under by happy viewers of all races and creeds.There is a message here for us all.Harry and Meghan’s wedding did more than unite this nation in sympathy and affection for a popular prince and the love of his life. It showed this country is world class.The sub-plot, of course, was the emotional union between the damaged children of two broken families.Fans have long yearned for Prince Harry to find happiness after the roller-coaster life and shocking death of his fabled mother, Princess Diana.They have warmed to a young man who transformed himself from a mixed-up kid to a likeable soldier, helicopter pilot and champion of war-damaged Invictus casualties.As for his bride, Meghan Markle is the glamorous star of hit TV series Suits, who dreamed as a child of becoming a princess.Best of all in this age of right-on political correctness, she is the daughter of a charming African-American mother and an Emmy-winning Hollywood lighting specialist.The House of Windsor is now truly multicultural.It is also hip.Our amazing sovereign, at 92, and doughty Prince Philip, 96, both heading for their royal telegrams, are the Queen and King of Cool.Where else in the world would you see an Elton John double act with Windy City preacher Bishop Michael Curry?This was a truly uplifting occasion, worn lightly by a once-stuffy Royal Family.Nobody does it better when it comes to choreographing mounted cavalry, trumpets, banners and horse-drawn carriages with an electric-powered E-Type and a vintage Rolls-Royce.All underscored by a sense of humour, as Harry and his supportive brother William exchanged banter at the altar of Windsor’s historic St George’s Chapel.Even the weather turned out in tribute, bathing Windsor Great Park’s glorious greenery in spring sunshine.There may have been some muffled coughs over Markle family squabbles but they were nothing compared with the torrid dramas leading to the Queen’s own “annus horribilis”.The world has become used to British pageantry.But this Royal Wedding was a timely reminder that Britain is not just a small island with a fading history on the edge of Europe.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex ride in a carriage down The Long Walk back towards Windsor Castle after getting married in St Georges Chapel, WindsorThe 21st-century United Kingdom is an unrivalled brand on the global stage.The world was witnessing more than mere pomp and circumstance.This was UK plc on international parade, joining hands with the global community in a way no other nation can match — even the mighty USA.Had Meghan married into the family of a French or American president, a German Chancellor or a Kremlin tsar, would anyone have tuned in?Neither China nor Russia could captivate so many friendly eyeballs.The Olympics might do it.But London 2012 revealed Britain is best on these occasions, too.On Saturday, Britain proved it is capable of reaching out to a world beyond borders.Harry and Meghan’s marriage bonded the UK indelibly with the US.If the new Duke and Duchess have kids, they will be American citizens — as well as British due to Harry’s lineage — and will eventually be liable to American tax.Importantly, this wedding had special significance for the 2.5billion citizens of 52 Commonwealth countries, especially in Africa and the Caribbean, who swear allegiance to the Queen.My Australian in-laws were constantly on the phone from Sydney this weekend, all thoughts of becoming a republic abandoned, to discuss the finer points of royal protocol.But this event was watched from lands with no current ties to Britain — South America, the Far East and the Gulf States.It was a showcase of modern Britain forever adapting to change, the key to our success as an outward-looking nation.There was a clear hint of defiance, too. This steely couple were doing it their way.Our Brexit negotiators — on both sides of the argument — should take note.That big wide world, viewing us in high definition on Saturday, is where Britain’s future lies.These are our markets.The audience liked what they saw and they want some of what we’re having.In marketing terms alone, it was priceless.Too often we underestimate our strength and standing.We have developed an absurd inferiority complex.We’ve been led to believe we are too weak and puny to stand alone on the global stage.Yet we are among the world’s greatest economies, second only to Germany in the EU.We are a nuclear power with a real professional army which has helped keep the peace in Europe, and have an envied place on the UN Security Council.Republican lefties despise all this stuff.They smear Britain’s record as a brutal colonial power while ignoring our global lead in abolishing slavery.Disturbingly, some Conservatives seem to agree the UK is washed up and past its prime.Since we cannot run our own economy, they say, we should hand the job to unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.These, remember, would be the same Brussels flunkies who created the euro, wrecked the economies of member states and put millions of unemployed young people on the scrap heap.Most of those workless youngsters gratefully upped sticks and moved here.I wonder why?Saturday’s Royal Wedding showed we are in the Premier League.Now the world is watching, perhaps with slightly less enthusiasm, as another British saga lurches towards its climax — another broken family consumed with jealousy and bent on revenge.The cast is familiar — the statutory drunk, a bully who prefers to talk with a gun in his hand, some characters who would prefer a car crash to a happy ending.Can we stop the bickering and reach a good Brexit deal?Why can’t the Leavers and Remainers put the country first, join hands, bury their differences and take a vow to work together to serve the national interest?Inspired by the Royal Wedding, by the poem Invictus, we can rise above petty differences.“We are the masters of our fate: We are the captains of our soul.”Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Oh well.Most married couples leave it 18 months before they reach that arrangement.But on that bombshell it was on with the Royal Wedding, which normally divides the nation into two distinct camps.There are the royalists, who have great fun watching all the pomp and pageantry on television.And the republicans, who have great fun hating all the pomp and pageantry on television.So the only real choice to be made, for all of us, is: Which channel?Personally, six hours of a photobombing Kay Burley giving it the full Partridge on Sky News was a punishment that’s way beyond me, as was five hours of the E! channel gang ­yelling: “Oh my God. Wow!”ITV was never going to be anything less than thoroughly professional in the hands of Julie Etchingham and Phillip Schofield, once he shut up about Holly Willoughby, so I went with the Beeb, where Naga called it a night shortly after announcing Prince Harry was now: “The Duke of Essex.”Oi! Oi! “Sussex rather.” Oh. Pity.The real surprise for some of you, though, might have been discovering that to give it an informal vibe, ­alongside Kirsty Young, BBC1’s 9am-and-beyond coverage was now being fronted by the strangely contorted ­figure of Dermot O’Leary — the former host of ITV’s The Marriage Ref.A show that may have been the ­perfect rehearsal for most royal ­weddings, but probably not this one.They weren’t alone, obviously.The Beeb had the joint surrounded, in fact, by among others Huw Edwards, ­fashion expert Jo Elvin, who was “across the dress” (as clueless as the rest of us), Alex Jones, Ore Oduba and Anita Rani, who performed the ­essential task of repeating what the other person had just said.Ore: “First glimpse of the dress, it’s going to be a moment.”Anita: “It’s going to be a moment.” Traditionally, of course, on these great state occasions, the moment TV crews start interviewing other TV crews is the cue for the coverage to descend into flannel, repetition, idle speculation, cliche (“Excitement’s ­building”), imponderable questions and outright stupidity.On Saturday, by slight contrast, the trigger was actually the arrival of Oprah Winfrey and the first trickle of celebrity guests, who had a clearly ­nervous ­Dermot asking: “When the invite says ‘hats’, does that mean hats are an absolute given?”“Absolutely, it does,” said Kirsty, slapping him down testily.It got progressively worse with each arrival as well.So by the time Amal Clooney wafted in alongside husband George, who was dressed as one of Modern Romance, even basic motor tasks seemed beyond some of the BBC team.Kirsty: “It can be difficult to wear a hat, can’t it?”Jo: “I think so, yes.”In fairness, it should also be stated this idiocy was certainly not restricted to the BBC.I switched over to ITV during the ­arrivals and heard Meghan’s old drama teacher, Gigi Perreau, say: “This is incredible and we’re right there. Well, we’re here but we’re also there, so it’s fabulous.”It’s just the nature of the beast.With so much time to fill, everyone will say these things.Only the BBC, though, could possibly leave me feeling queasy with the choice of one of its Royal Wedding experts.This was left-wing “social commentator” Afua Hirsch, who was privately educated and has led a life of unimaginable advantage, compared to most of us, but is also a professional victim who thinks pretty much ­everything is “racist”, wants Nelson’s Column torn down and wasn’t about to drop her agenda with such a large audience at her mercy.“While I have felt alienated by the inherited privilege,” said Afua, who’s enjoyed more than most, “my own struggles with identity have made me appreciate the need for cultural ­continuity.“So while I didn’t relate to the Royal Family, I did relate to that need for a sense of tradition.”Quite a brass neck, isn’t it, speaking out against the whole concept of the Royal Family, while simultaneously using them to increase your TV profile, as Afua had been doing all week.Instead of telling her so, or pointing out Harry’s ex Chelsy Davy had arrived while she was guffing away, a nodding Dermot said he could listen to Afua “all day”.A claim I doubt, frankly.Indeed, I reckon he’d have been throwing himself off Windsor Castle’s ramparts before breakfast if he’d tried.No one else, I suspect though, was listening to a single word she said.Nor will they have needed Afua’s lofty approval to enjoy a day filled with so many memorable events, including Bishop Michael Curry’s fiery address to the congregation, the ­reappearance of the Duke of Edinburgh and Meghan’s Rolls-Royce ­hurtling up the Long Walk past 100,000 Union Flags like it was being driven by Richard Hammond.These are all magical moments you’ll possibly want to watch again — and if you do, having sat through both start to finish, I’d probably recommend the ITV version.It had the better ­historic detail, was never in any danger of missing Chelsy Davy’s arrival and rounded everything off nicely as well.Over on the BBC, meanwhile, Kirsty did it by searching for profundities and going where angels feared to tread.“Something has travelled between Harry and Meghan that might be the next page of the story, where they give us a gorgeous little product of their union which we might enjoy too . . . ?”Though not if Naga’s honeymoon arrangements are to be believed, they won’t.Obviously.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Brexit negotiators should remember this.An exciting new era awaits the happy couple, and us, as a truly global Great Britain.SHADOW Chancellor John McDonnell is a sinister politician who would wreck Britain’s finances.Yesterday he outlined how he wants to overthrow capitalism and introduce socialism.He and Jeremy Corbyn would take us down a very dark path. Just look at once-rich Venezuela, where socialism resulted in the poor starving to death and there being no medicine for the sick.Madly, McDonnell yesterday claimed the South American country’s problem was that it was not socialist enough. He also said he wanted a “zero- tolerance” approach to anti-Semitism, yet defended Labour’s appointment of Martha Osamor to the House of Lords.That’s the same Martha Osamor who claimed the party’s anti-Semitism row was manufactured as “a tool to intimidate activists on the Left”.We wouldn’t expect anything less from McDonnell, a man who glorified the IRA, described London rioters as “the best of our movement” and joked about lynching a Tory minister.There are rumours the Government is insanely considering calling a snap election — risking handing this scary clown the keys to the country finances.The Tories would not just be gambling their future, but Britain’s.CULTURE Secretary Matt Hancock is right to get tough with the social media giants.For far too long Facebook and Google have shown no concern for the youngsters using their sites.Mr Hancock invited 14 of the internet giants to a consultation.

Later, I went back with him after he had built a night school for the boys, and asked over a cup of tea: “Why are you doing this, Harry?”He replied: “This is the most important thing I do.”It tells you everything about who his mother was.Inside the Chapel, the hymn was Guide Me, O Thou Great Redeemer, which was played at Princess Diana’s funeral and one of her favourites.Di’s sister Lady Jane Fellowes delivered the only reading. Listening to it was Sarah, the Duchess of York, who had not been invited to other recent royal weddings.Inviting Fergie was a brilliant thing to do. During Diana’s troubled times every Sunday she would drive down to Berkshire to have lunch with Fergie, spending the afternoon talking about their divorces.Outside in the Chapel courtyard were 2,000 people from Harry and Meghan’s charities, including servicemen who have lost limbs.Harry is following Diana’s hugely successful campaign to stop landmines by working with those who have been wounded by IEDs.When Harry was flying back from one of his tours of Afghanistan he shared the plane with three soldiers who were in a coma.He realised these soldiers, if they recovered, would have limbs missing and facing a life of misery — which is why he inspired them with his support for the Invictus Games.And Harry and Meghan asked guests to make donations to the Children’s HIV Association.Harry has clearly never forgotten how his mother took the stigma out of Aids by embracing sufferers, including babies in Brazil.And then there was the ring. On Saturday night Meghan was wearing the emerald-cut aquamarine ring Diana first wore in 1996.Harry once told ITV’s Tom Bradby: “I wanted to do something that would make my mother proud.” He succeeded on Saturday.Want to celebrate Harry and Meghans wedding like a royal?Weve made a brand new Snapchat lens just for the big day!Unlock The Suns Royal Wedding lens on Snapchat here and send us your snaps to @TheSunUKOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I might only have a slim chance.According to Sky News, the mum-of-one added: There is something called clemency.Give me that for the sake of my baby. She hasnt seen her father for over two years now.I would ask the judge today to close this new case and give me parole, so that I can go home and have another baby and have a normal life.The judge said he would address her case as a priority.Earlier, her husband Richard said they were holding our breath after she appeared in the Iranian court on Saturday.She has been told she faces new charges of spreading propaganda and is likely to be convicted.And Boris Johnson today insisted the Foreign Office is working on a daily basis to free her.The 40-year-old charity worker appeared at the hearing where she was presented with a 200-page document and told she needed a new lawyer.Richard, speaking to The Sun Online, dismissed the so-called evidence against her.He said: Most of it seems to be press cuttings of our campaign, its not ‘evidence’ of her having done stuff.”Despite the new hearing the couple are still in the dark as to what happens next.Richard said: “Our experience of the court process so far is that it hasn’t been very positive so there’s a bit of holding our breath this time.“In terms of what happens next? Who knows.”During the hearing Judge Salavait warned her that she was likely to be found guilty and dismissed her lawyer and gave her just ten days to find a new one.The couple have been given some hope as the court allowed Nazanin to phone the British embassy for the first time since being in prison.Richard said: “The court case happened on Saturday, which made us pretty low. Then there was the phone call on Sunday which made us more upbeat.“The fact that she was allowed to call is a good thing. It’s very easy for me to over-read things and get confused.”He added the response of the embassy had been quite cautious - I guess they were trying to get their bearings on why this was allowed.”Richard added that he hoped the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson would do everything in his powers to help.He said: “We’ll try and meet with the Foreign Office this week and work out what’s going on and we will want the Foreign Secretary to do what he can.That would be an intervention. One of the things we asked before was for him to try and visit her and to make it really clear that the UK was standing by her.“We also asked that the Government protest – the ambassador protesting and the Foreign Secretary protesting, which would be a more serious level.“The gravitas of the Foreign Secretary can make a difference.”“I’d like him to do what he can. It’s not for me to tell him how to do it.”Speaking during a trip to Buenos Aires today, Mr Johnson insisted his officials are dedicated to helping the British mum.He told reporters: I can tell you absolutely sincerely that there is not a day that goes by in which we are not working in the Foreign Office on every single one of the incredibly sad consular cases that we have - and particularly the difficult cases we have in Iran.But he claimed it would not help Nazanins case to give regular updates - adding that Mr Ratcliffe should be reassured by the attention the Foreign Office is giving to her ordeal.During the hearing Judge Salavait told her she was likely to be found guilty.Human rights body Amnesty International described the judges comments of a likely conviction over the new charges as another body blow.Kerry Moscogiuri, Amnesty International UK’s Campaigns Director, said: “This is yet another body blow for Nazanin.The latest developments in the case come at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the West after Donald Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal recently, breaking with US allies in Europe and potentially worsening the crisis in the Middle East.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo signalled today that the United States would take a hardline against the Islamic Republic, saying the US would impose the strongest sanctions in history if the countrys leadership did not change its foreign and domestic policy.The actions of the US though has led to a split with its European Union allies, including Britain.Mr Johnson attempted to salvage the nuclear deal by holding crisis talks to thrash out a last-minute deal in the hope that Tehran did not ditch the deal.Nazanin has been held in Iran on spying claims since 2016, when she was arrested during a holiday with her daughter Gabriella.Nazanin was originally arrested at Tehran airport on April 3, 2016.After being detained for over five months, initially in solitary confinement for 45 days without access to a lawyer, Nazanin was sentenced to five years in prison in September 2016 after being convicted of “membership of an illegal group”.She is currently being held in Tehrans Evin Prison.Members of Nazanin’s family visited prosecutors for an update on her case earlier this month, and according to Mr Ratcliffe they say she is being used as a bargaining chip.He said she told him of the development in a 5.30am phone call on May 14, and added: I have no clue why they have started all this nonsense again. They know Boris is coming.Please take me out of this, please. My parents have had enough. I want my daughter back. She needs both of us. So tell the world.

She is making big money with an exclusive TV interview.”Samantha regularly tweets about her half-sister, and her Twitter profile includes candid photographs of them growing up together.Meanwhile, Doria Ragland, 64, has remained largely silent after it was revealed her daughter had fallen in love with a Prince, with the American mum jetting into the UK to be by Meghans side ahead of the wedding.The mum was quickly welcomed by the Royal Family, with the bride even thanking her new in-laws for their kindness to her mum.But Samantha appears to be unimpressed at Doria, who is believed to be filming an interview with Oprah Winfrey while they are both in London.Oprah, 64, arrived at the wedding alone after securing the landmark chat with Meg’s mum. The US talkshow icon later described the day as “extraordinary”.A royal source revealed: “The plan is for Doria to film part of her interview while Oprah is in London. That’s why she was invited to the wedding. There’s huge secrecy about what the interview will involve and when it will air.“But both Doria and Meghan felt it was critical for Oprah to be at the wedding to really understand.“Oprah is an icon in the US media and a role model to African American women. She has an untouchable status and is becoming a key adviser to both Meghan and Doria.”Samanthas criticism comes after she was compared to the Middletons, with one Twitter user saying: It would be nice if you would take your cues from the Middleton family-or any family members of the royal’s spouses for that matter-who NEVER sell them out to the press or on social media.Samantha hit out, saying:

environment","story":"Campaigners from Blue Planet Society compiled the images to lobby the fast food chain to scrap balloons and ditch single-use plastic like straws.But founder John Hourston, 52, says it has been met with resistance - and claims the balloons are more damaging than any other form of plastic waste.Balloons from British branches of McDonalds have washed up across the North Sea, as far away as the coastlines of Belgium and Germany.John said: Weve collected 300 images in about a year, nearly one a day.In the marine environment, balloons are unlike any other form of human waste - they mimic marine food.If they go into the atmosphere they blow up, become shredded and end up falling down in fragments.They end up in the stomachs of seabirds, turtles, whales and dolphins.We know that plastics in the environment attract pollutants.To get to nanoplastics, they have to be in the marine environment for months or years.Nanoplastics are so small that they could be absorbed through the gut walls of humans.It is a ticking time bomb.The passionate conservationist, who lives in Bournemouth, Dorset, said the three components of a balloon pose a risk.He added: They are a lethal form of airborn litter.Most other litter does not have the ability to travel hundreds of miles.What I can say for certain is that British balloons are the biggest problem.John has written to the British CEO of McDonalds, Steve Easterbrook, to raise his concerns.He added: The Happy Meal balloon promotion is the gateway for McDonalds to hooking kids into fast-food and for some reason they seem abnormally attached to the idea.My personal feeling is that they think the balloons are an integral part of their marketing.They could easily change this with their global profits.I think they could come up with an idea that is more appealing to children than balloons.An activist from the Danish island of Fanoe, on the west coast, wrote: On our beach we can easily find 10- 15 happy meal balloons every day.Wildlife could be seen in some of the pictures, including seals and puffins.A spokesman for McDonalds said: Helium balloons are no longer in use in the majority of our coastal restaurants.We strive to be a good neighbour in all the communities we operate in and work closely with our suppliers to ensure all of our balloons are made from biodegradable materials.We have taken a number of steps to encourage customers to dispose of litter responsibly, and are currently in the process of replacing all helium balloons with stick balloons in coastal restaurants.Our priority remains to provide our customers with the correct messaging on waste disposal and ensure we play our part in keeping the environment litter free."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407928594.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"roman abramovich vladimir putin relationship russia yacht","story":"The Chelsea owner, 51, and his business dealings are under the spotlight once again after his UK visa was delayed amid a government probe into Russian oligarchs living in Britain.Known for his “stealthy” and often ruthless business acumen, Abramovich has amassed a fortune of £9billion thanks to his close ties to the Kremlin and in particular President Vladimir Putin, 61.After meeting future business partner and Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky in 1993, Abramovich was able to forge alliances in the Yeltsin government including with Putin.He and former car dealer Berezovsky were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million (£148 million) in an auction which is alleged to have been rigged.But it was his relationship with then-Prime Minister Putin which enabled him to consolidate Russia’s warring aluminium industry between himself and a small number of other oligarchs.The mega deal – made in February 2000, three months before Putin became the country’s President – would transform Abramovich’s life and business portfolio.A Putin biographer described the ex-KGB spys relationship with Abramovich as being similar to that of a father and favourite son, reports The Times.In 2016, it was revealed that the billionaire was able to gift the Kremlin strongman a £25million superyacht named Olympia.Putin is said to have maintained the luxury boat using state funds.In 2012, a high court judge said Abramovich had “very good relations” and privileged access to Putin.The oligarch, who purchased Chelsea football club in 2003, was in court after Berezovsky accused him of forcing him to sell his Sibneft shares for a cut price.But despite acknowledging Abramovich’s strong relationship with Putin, judge Mrs Justice Gloster said his influence on the government’s decision-making was “limited.She said: There was no evidential basis supporting the contention that Mr Abramovich was in a position to manipulate, or otherwise influence, President Putin, or officers in his administration, to exercise their powers in such a way as to enable Mr Abramovich to achieve his own commercial goals.I am prepared to assume that, on occasion, President Putin may have taken his views into account when making decisions, but the suggestion that Mr Abramovich was in a position to pull the presidential strings was simply not borne out by the evidence.She ruled in the Chelsea owners favour calling him courteousand frank while accusing Berozovsky of being an inherently unreliable witness.Orphaned at four, and adopted by his uncle, Abramovich left school at 16 and briefly studied engineering before joining the army.After working as a mechanic, he started his own business becoming a market trader in 1980s Moscow selling toys such as rubber ducks.At the age of 25, he is accused of “procuring financial gain by means of fraud” by allegedly forging three million kilograms of diesel in 1992.The fuel, carried by five railway tankers and worth 3.8bn roubles (around £400million), was “emptied and appropriated”, reports the .The rumours surrounding the diesel tankers have never been substantiated.By the early 1990s, Abramovich reportedly set up and liquidated at least 20 companies in industries as diverse as tyre retreading and bodyguard recruitment.But it was during a Caribbean holiday in 1993 where he would meet Kremlin insider Boris Berezovsky and forge one of the most significant relationships of his career.Abramovich admitted in court that he paid Berezovsky a total of $2.5bn for political access inside President Boris Yeltsins 1990s government.In the mid-90s, the pair were able to buy Siberian oil giant Sibneft for less than $200 million despite the firm being valued at $15billion (£11billion) in 2003Through Berezovsky, Abramovich was able to forge an alliance with Yeltsin ally Vladimir Putin."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407971109.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"royal wedding official photos meghan markle prince harry

Markle, 36, and her mother Doria Ragland by her side, surrounded by their new royal in-laws in the Green Drawing Room of Windsor Castle.The photograph shows just how much the Royal Family has changed, with the American actress standing by her royal husband, the Queen and her yoga instructor mother.Highlights from the Royal WeddingAnother more relaxed photograph shows the newlyweds sitting on some steps, with Prince Harrys arm protectively around his new wife as they both beam with delight hours after being declared man and wife.In a statement from Kensington Palace, the newlyweds said: The Duke and Duchess would like to thank everyone who took part in the celebrations of their Wedding.They feel so lucky to have been able to share their day with all those gathered in Windsor and those who watched on television across the UK, Commonwealth, and around the world.In the third photograph, Prince Harry and Meghan can be seen sitting on the floor in Windsor Castle - surrounded by their adorable bridesmaids and pageboys, including Prince George and Princess Charlotte.Fifth-in-line to the throne Charlotte particularly seemed to be at home in front of the camera, with the three-year-old having been on sparkling form all day.And big brother George seemed to appear slightly more comfortable as he stood with the couple, giving a cheeky grin in the snaps.Meanwhile, two-year-old Zalie Warren appeared to be distracted in both photographs.The toddler stared off into the distance while the other members of the bridal party posed for the camera.But while the photographs have been flooded with compliments, some fans have noticed a bizarre optical illusion in two of the snaps thanks to mirrors in the drawing room.The photographs come just days after Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in front of a star-studded crowd from the Queen to the Clooneys.The Prince, who has previously revealed that he knew Meghan was the one for him the moment they met, hadnt hesitated to propose to the US actress.And the pairs whirlwind romance came to a head over the weekend when Meghan married her very own Prince in the romantic ceremony that broke with tradition and celebrated the couples modern relationship.The wedding ceremony saw the couple seal the deal with a sweet kiss in front of Windsors St Georges Chapel.Prince Harry couldnt take his eyes off his new wife, who stunned in a simply elegant white gown by Givenchy designer Clare Waight Keller.The new Duchess of Sussex completed her look with Queen Mary’s diamond bandeau, made in 1932 - on loan from the Queen.Meanwhile, Prince Harry has been praised for his humility and commitment for choosing to wear his regiments Blues and Royals uniform with the rank of Major, instead of his generals uniform.More than 100,000 people turned out in Windsor to greet the newlyweds as they made their way through the town after the ceremony.The thousands of people who were in Windsor in person - plus the millions of viewers who tuned in around the world - were left melting at the couples adoring relationship.From Harry whispering I missed you to Meghan when she arrived at the altar to the flowers he had picked for her bouquet the day before, every moment of the wedding was filled with the couples unique identity and love for each other.Wedding watchers hailed Prince Harry and Meghan, saying the couple had thrown the Royal Family into the 21st century with their modern ceremony that included a gospel choir and charismatic American bishop. Ingrid Seward, Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine, told The Sun Online: Theres never been a royal wedding like in modern history.It was certainly a departure from tradition and and bodes well for the future of the modern monarchy.Their wholly modern ceremony was a far cry from Royal Weddings of previous generations and showed the Monarchy mirroring modern Britain.Mixed-race divorcee Meghan, 36, was embraced with open arms by her in-laws — a welcome not extended to previous newcomers to the family."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407462240.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"the

progressively worsening shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing - was cut in half when patients were treated with dupilumab.And those taking the placebo suffered at least one asthma exacerbation a day.Although the drug significantly reduced asthma symptoms for all patients, dupilumab worked particularly well in patients with high numbers of a specific type of white blood cell, called eosinophils, circulating in the bloodstream.For those patients, asthma exacerbations were cut by two-thirds.Lead author Mario Castro, a distinguished professor in pulmonology and critical care medicine, said: This drug not only reduced severe symptoms of asthma, it improved the ability to breathe.Thats important because these patients have a chronic disabling disease that worsens over time with loss of lung function.So far, we do not have a drug for asthma that changes the course of the disease.Current drugs for severe asthma help reduce trips to the emergency room, for example, but they dont improve lung function.For the first study, 1,900 patients needing three types of inhalers to manage their symptoms were split into two groups, one to receive dupilumab and one to receive a placebo for a year.Not only did the drug reduce symptoms, the patients receiving dupilumab showed improved lung function in a test of forced expiratory volume - a test that measures how much air a persons lung can exhale.Patients receiving dupilumab, regardless of dose, improved their lung function by approximately 130-200 milliliters greater than those receiving the placebo.Hospital visits were also down with only 3.5 per cent of dupilumab patients needing to go to A\u0026ampE compared to 6.5 per cent of the placebo group.The second study suggests patients could be weaned off strong steroids, currently used to treat asthma.Long-term use of steroids can have debilitating effects including stunted growth, diabetes, cataracts and osteoporosis.Some 200 patients who had used inhalers and oral steroids to control their asthma were recruited for the second study.Half were put on dupilumab and the other half a placebo.After a year of treament 80 per cent of those on the dupilumab trial were able cut their steroid doses in half, compared to a small amount on the placebo trial.I have patients who have had to stop working and go on disability because their asthma symptoms are so severe they can no longer function in the workplace, Prof. Castro said.Im excited about the potential of dupilumab because I have so many patients who have maxed out on available therapies and they still cant breathe. It can become a very disabling disease."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000407986374.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"prince harry and meghan arrive

“to crack down on people close to Putin who may have illicit or ill-gotten wealth”.Pointing to new US sanctions recently slapped on Putin’s cronies, Mr Johnson said: “The truth is actually that I think the effect of some of those sanctions - particularly on some individuals - has been very marked and I’ve noted that”.The Kremlin refused to discuss Mr Abramovich’s embarrassment, but branded a

So the inescapable conclusion is that Mr Livingstone has jumped before he was pushed. After left-wing activist Marc Wadsworth was expelled for anti-Semitism towards the Labour MP Ruth Smeeth a few weeks ago, the disciplinary panel would probably had found against \"Red Ken\" too.Critics of Mr Corbyn claimed earlier this year that he had hounded out Labour\u0027s former general secretary Iain McNicol, awarded a peerage on the eve of the Royal Wedding last week, and that his replacement, former Unite official Jennie Formby, was a stooge.But to be fair to the new general secretary, in the short time since she succeeded Mr McNicol both Marc Wadsworth and now Mr Livingstone have gone, suggesting she has made a swift impact and confounding those critics who claim the Labour leadership has failed to tackle anti-Semitism.As a result, his one-year suspension was extended by another year.It was then that the Labour MP John Mann confronted the former London mayor in front of reporters in Westminster, accusing him of being a \"Nazi apologist\".Mr Mann, who chairs parliament\u0027s All-Party Parliamentary Group Against Antisemitism, chased Mr Livingstone up the stairs at the Westminster offices of Sky News, shouting and calling him a \"f****** disgrace\", which resulted in extraordinary TV pictures showing the clash.This year, the anti-Semitism row in the Labour Party has become more damaging.An unprecedented demonstration by Jewish organisations, supported by dozens of Labour MPs, filled Parliament Square and there was evidence that the row robbed Labour of taking control of Barnet Council in the elections on 3 May.After the Parliament Square demonstration, the leaders of the same organisations held a meeting with Mr Corbyn in Westminster, but immediately dismissed the talks as a missed opportunity.The first demand of these Jewish groups - and the so-called \"moderate\" Labour MPs who joined them in Parliament Square in March - was the expulsion of Mr Livingstone from the party.Some of Mr Livingstone\u0027s strongest critics are disappointed that he was not put through the formal disciplinary procedure and expelled, claiming that would have made his return to the party impossible, while resignation leaves the door slightly ajar.In his resignation statement, Mr Livingstone said he recognised he had caused offence and upset in the Jewish community. \"I am truly sorry for that,\" he said.But he said he does not accept the allegation that he has brought the Labour Party into disrepute, nor guilty of anti-Semitism. That suggests he is unrepentant and remains defiant. Mr Livingstone has, of course, quit the Labour Party before, when he stood as candidate for London mayor as an independent after he was denied the Labour nomination by a plot by Tony Blair to install Frank Dobson instead.Four years later he was back in the Labour fold, though, after a humiliating climbdown by Mr Blair, who declared tongue-in-cheek: \"I always said that Ken would make a good mayor.\""},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/03/2048x1152/skynews-barack-obama-michelle_4251357.jpg?20180309182157 ","title":"obamas confirm films and series netflix deal","story":"Mrs Obama said: \"Barack and I have always believed in the power of storytelling to inspire us, to make us think differently about the world around us, and to help us open our minds and hearts to others.\"The shows would give Mr Obama, who was US president for eight years until Donald Trump took over after the 2016 election, an unfiltered way of talking to the public.Among the issues close to the former president\u0027s heart are health care, voting rights, foreign policy and climate change while the former first lady championed the importance of nutrition during her time in the White House.In March it was reported that talks between Netflix and the couple were \"advanced\", and it was also said that the Obamas would not use the shows to respond to the current US President or their other conservative critics.It has not been revealed how much the Obamas will be paid under the deal."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-damsacus-assad-syria_4316659.jpg?20180521152946 ","title":"syrian government says damascus and surrounds free from militants","story":"The gain puts the government of Bashar al Assad in its strongest position since the Syrian war began in 2011.During those seven years, more than half a million people have died and half of the population driven from their homes.Assad\u0027s troops launched their offensive on southern Damascus a month ago, taking advantage of the gains enjoyed since Russia entered the war on their side in 2015.Earlier this year, they took eastern Ghouta, on the outskirts of Damascus, after thousands of opposition fighters surrendered.Some of the Islamic State fighters have been allowed to leave the Damascus area, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, but Syria\u0027s state media has denied there was a deal reached allowing their escape.The Observatory said that the fighters were heading east toward the desert and that they had been setting their offices and vehicles on fire so that government forces could not use them.Tehran has already said its forces will not leave Syria but will continue fighting \"terrorism\" there at the request of the Syrian government.Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Ghasemi said: \"Our presence in Syria has been based on a request by the Syrian government and Iran will continue its support as long as the Syrian government wants.\""},{"url":null,"title":"michael gove joked meghan markles","story":"NewsMichael Gove joked about Meghan Markle’s “exotic” heritage as he launched a think tank aimed at attracting young people to the Conservative PartyThe Environment Secretary also compared himself to an infamous wife-beater\u0026nbspShareByMikey SmithPolitical reporterDan BloomPolitical reporter21:13, 21 MAY 2018Updated22:21, 21 MAY 2018NewsMichael Gove made the gaffe about Meghan Markle\u0027s background at a thinktank launch (Image: AFP)\u0026nbspShareGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMichael Gove compared himself to an infamous wife-beater and made a joke about Meghan Markle’s “exotic” heritage as he launched a think tank aimed at attracting young people to the Conservative Party. The Environment Secretary made the gaffe as he launched ‘Onward’ at a boozy reception in Parliament with Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson. He joked: “Looking around this evening, an evening when we have five speeches, white wine, a warm room - we’re inevitably reminded of weddings. “And indeed as I came in and the canap\u0026eacutes were being handed out someone said it is a bit like a wedding reception. “I did think for a moment, yes it was.  “Because you have this amazing woman from an exotic background, who turns heads, and who is transforming a staid and traditional institution by sheer force of charisma on the one hand.  “And then you’ve got a lad who’s occasionally walked on the wild side, done some naughty stuff, but at last has a chance for redemption.” He went on to compare himself to two famously terrible celebrity husbands, both of whom have been accused of being physically or psychologically abusive in their relationships. He said: “In talking of course about weddings, about partnerships, it’s a pleasure of course to be here, particularly for me, with Ruth. “And spending some time on the same platform with Ruth, I feel rather like Ike to Tina Turner - or Sonny to Cher. He paused, then after laughter and sharp intakes of breath, he added: “I know where the real talent lies.” Ike Turner was married to singer Tina from 1962 to 1978.  They divorced after a violent argument, after which the Private Dancer singer publicly accused him of violent spousal abuse throughout their relationship.  In a 1985 interview, Ike admitted: “Yeah I hit her, but I didn\u0027t hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.” Cher and Sonny Bono were one of the most iconic couples of the 1970s, shooting to superstardom with their duet ‘I Got You Babe.’ But behind closed doors, Cher has since described him as a “terrible husband”, and listed the reason for their 1974 divorce as “Involuntary Servitude.” In 1999, she explained: “He was like the father. You know how you can be frightened of your father even if he doesn’t ever do anything? It wasn’t like, I mean, he never hit me, never really yelled at me. He could be tough, though.  “He could just be real tough in that kind of horrible, tough Sicilian way. I couldn’t stand on my own two feet and talk back to him. That was my problem. I could just never ever talk back to him, and so I never got any of my needs met that weren’t what he felt they should be.” Ms Davidson had earlier joked that the best way to present the modern face of the Conservative Party was to invite the “pregnant lesbian” to speak. Taking the stage for his speech, Mr Gove said: “In future when think tanks ask please, can we get a pregnant lesbian, the answer for all those of us who are modernisers in the Conservative Party should be ‘which of the many pregnant lesbians?’. It came as Ms Davidson said Tories had looked too dour, joyless and authoritarian.

The twins, who both had the same genetic condition, went for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) assessments at different times and one was approved, while the other was rejected. Last month the Work and Pensions select committee found that for at least 290,000 claimants of PIP and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA), 6% of all those assessed, the right decision on entitlement was not made first time around. Labour and Liberal Democrat MPs at Work and Pensions questions raised individual cases where people were having issues with PIP and ESA, including one suffering with epilepsy and another with an inoperable brain tumour.  Labour MP Emma Reynolds, speaking in the Commons, said: I\u0027ve been helping identical twins who have the same genetic condition involving learning disabilities and associated health problems, both were assessed for PIP at different times by different assessors, one was granted PIP and one was rejected. This case has now been resolved but can\u0027t the minister see that the system is totally unfit for purpose and needs overhauling?  Work and Pensions Minister Sarah Newton drew scoffs from the Labour benches when she told MPs the fact the case was resolved showed the system was working. She said: The very fact that the case has been resolved shows that the system is working. It\u0027s very important to me that we make the right decision the first time and I\u0027ve set in place a whole series of improvements to PIP, we have followed the advice given to us by the independent review of PIP and are working at pace to make the necessary changes.  A number of MPs raised the high level of successful appeals by those looking to claim PIP and ESA, with around two thirds of all appeals overturned in favour of the claimant. Ms Newton said she was absolutely determined to ensure the right decision is made every time, and said: There have been 3.1 million PIP decisions made and 9% of those have been appealed and 4% of those have been overturned. But MPs kept on raising individual cases to the minister. Lib Dem Layla Moran said a constituent with a rare inherited disorder had received the old Disability Living Allowance (DLA), but since turning 16 was scored zero in every category on her PIP assessment. Would the minister consent to meet with me and my constituent so we can iron out this clear case of computer says no, the Oxford West and Abingdon MP added.  Labour whip Jeff Smith said he had two cases where constituents with serious and deteriorating cerebral palsy both scored zero points on their PIP assessments. In both cases, the constituents require round the clock care, and yet both are forced to appeal the PIP decisions, he said. Does the minister think it\u0027s acceptable that people with serious and deteriorating disabilities are being forced to go through the courts to get the support they deserve? His Labour colleague Clive Efford (Eltham) added: My constituent was called back early for a Personal Independence Payment assessment. The assessment made no reference to the fact he has an inoperable brain tumour, which has led to him having intractable epilepsy and Parkinson\u0027s disease. Can the minister explain why he was recalled for an assessment?  Labour former minister Angela Eagle said her constituent of working age had suffered two strokes and has now been diagnosed as suffering from vascular dementia.

A spokeswoman for the London fire brigade confirmed the owners of 101 residential blocks over 18 metres tall had been told to change their advice to residents. In the event of a fire, the advice has changed from “stay put” to “simultaneous evacuation” after work to inspect the safety of their cladding systems. It is a huge change with the standard advice that residents should “stay put” if a fire breaks out which was repeated after the Grenfell Tower Tragedy last year.  Asking an urgent question on Grenfell Tower, Labour\u0027s John Healey said that there was confusion about advice given by different fire services. He told MPs: Many people will have learned only yesterday that the London fire service has fundamentally changed its safety advice to residents in blocks still wrapped with the same Grenfell-style cladding. In place of “stay put” if a fire breaks out—strong advice given for decades to all residents in all tower blocks across the country, including those in Grenfell Tower—the London fire brigade now says “get out” directly. And he asked ministers to clarify the position to reassure all those living in high-rise blocks.  Do all fire brigades now give the same advice? Do all residents in all blocks with unsafe cladding know that? I say to the Minister that more action, more clarity and more urgency are required from the Government. When will the Secretary of State publish a clear national statement on evacuation policy?\u0027 he asked. Other MPs joined his call for clarity.  Brentford and Isleworth MP Ruth Cadbury said: What are the Government doing to ensure that residents of these high-risk buildings are made aware of the new arrangements about leaving in the case of a fire? And she said that residents in her constituency had not got the message.  Eight months since the change of policy there, she said. Residents of the privately owned Blenheim block in Hounslow have still not been given evacuation instructions or had a fire drill, and the only people who left the building when several fire engines turned up at one of several recent fires were the paid fire marshals. While Labour MP Karen Buck said: The “stay put” policy has been a recognised element of fire safety for a long time, and those of us who have thousands of residents in high-rise towers in our constituencies now want clarity from the Government.  She asked whether residents were supposed to know what type of cladding was on the outside of their block. My understanding is that the London fire brigade has changed its policy for blocks with particular types of cladding, but are residents expected to know what kind of environment they are living in before deciding whether to stay put or to leave? she said.

The Government revealed the southbound motorway in Kent would be brought to standstill by thousands of stationary trucks queuing for docks like Dover, if there are delays. Cars heading to the continent would be able to use the northbound carriageway along with vehicles heading towards London, with workers setting up a contraflow system. The plan - similar to Operation Stack, the procedure implemented by Kent Police and Highways England to park lorries on the motorway when strikes in France cripple cross-Channel ferries and Eurotunnel trains - will be ready from early next year.  It comes after ministers shelved plans for a \u0026pound250million lorry park at the size of the motorway. Britain is due to quit the EU on March 29, 2019. The latest plan was slipped out in a written parliamentary statement on “road haulage”. Confirming the move, Transport Minister Baroness Liz Sugg said: “The Department has now agreed with Highways England that this arrangement should take the form of a contraflow system which would see lorries for the Port of Dover and Eurotunnel held on the coast-bound carriageway between junctions 8-9 of the M20, while other traffic will use a contraflow to continue their journey on the other side of the motorway. “Highways England are starting the preparatory works for the scheme now and it will be available from early 2019.”  Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said: “The Government’s approach to contingency planning for lorries on the economically vital M20 link to the Port of Dover has been incompetent and disastrous. “It had to scrap an important \u0026pound250million lorry park near the M20 last year because it got the plans wrong and has wasted millions on renting space for lorries at Manston Airport which has never been used.  “A no-deal Brexit could grind the South East of England to a halt.” Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said: “The Transport Secretary is right to start worrying about potential serious disruption to cross-Channel transport. “If no customs deal is reached and tariffs kick in, spot checks will start on the 10,000 lorries that go through Dover alone every day and the Channel ports will simply freeze up. “Nobody voted to see our ports grind to a halt.” "},{"url":null,"title":"aldi barbecue discount bargain","story":"NewsAldi\u0027s 3-in-1 £99 bargain pizza oven is back for the bank holiday - and it\u0027s already sold out onlineThe supermarket giant has revealed a fresh batch of BBQ SpecialBuys\u0026nbspShareByDave Masters16:42, 21 MAY 2018Updated17:16, 21 MAY 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAldi is selling a super-cheap pizza oven - but it\u0027s proving such a hot bargain it\u0027s already sold out online.

The family photos of Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding day taken by Alexi Lubomirski have now been released - and just like William and Kate\u0027s official pictures, they were well worth the wait. The newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex released three photos: a full family picture, a picture of the bride and groom with their little page boys and bridesmaids and a black and white picture of the happy couple.  At the same time their wedding photographer posted the picture and a message on his own Instagram page.     He said: It has been an incredible honor and privilege to document the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s inspiring journey of love, hope and family from the engagement photos, all the way through to the official wedding and family portraits on Saturday. This has been a beautiful chapter in my career and life, that I will happily never forget. Thank you to everyone at @kensingtonroyal and @theroyalfamily. With the wedding one of the most heavily photographed events of the year, he did not need to take pictures of the ceremony, but will instead have focused on the portraits. That meant he was able to attend the wedding as a guest with wife Giada. He wrote on Instagram after the big day: Went to a little wedding today ) ...... Wow.. What a fantastic, surreal and wonderful day! Amazing to experience it as a guest and even more incredible to experience it as a photographer. Felt extremely fortunate to have been there AND to share the day with my beautiful wife (@ecoshaker) by my side, who looked stunning. MASSIVE CONGRATULATIONS to the happy couple!!!!  It seems a no-brainer to pick one of the world\u0027s top fashion photographers, who has shot the likes of Lupita Nyong\u0027o, Julia Roberts, Catherine Zeta Jones, Kate Winslet, Victoria Beckham, and Anne Hathaway. But perhaps the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex had more in mind when they first picked Lubomirski to take their pictures. Because he is a real Prince himself and has written an etiquette guide book called Princely Advice for a Happy Life.    At age 11 Lubormirski discovered a Polish royal lineage on his father\u0027s side that dates back 500 years. It was a Princess Diaries moment of sorts but with a catch — the house\u0027s reign had ended, and Alexi\u0027s seat would be the first not to bear any of the luxury trappings associated with royalty. In one generation, everything flipped completely, he told Harpers Bazaar . I was one generation away from 500 years of history.  According to the photographer\u0027s own website: The Lubomirski family is one of the most well- known and influential in Poland’s history. They were one of the largest landowners in Europe, and their members served as governors, statesmen, senators, diplomats, philanthropists, and patrons of the arts throughout the centuries. But he adds: After two world wars and the rise of communism, the family had lost centuries of art, land, palaces, and family treasures. It was a title with no physical riches. Lubomirski’s childhood was spent between England and Botswana with his Peruvian mother and English stepfather and he studied at The University of Brighton before he became Mario Testino\u0027s photography assistant. Of working with one of Princess Diana\u0027s favourite photographers, he told Bazaar : It was incredible to sit next to Mario Testino and just watch him work. You could be sitting in front of the Queen of England watching him make her smile or Gwyneth Paltrow trying to make her feel sexy when she [wasn\u0027t feeling] sexy.  Royal wedding in pictures: Most amazing photos from Harry and Meghan\u0027s beautiful day But it was his mother\u0027s words which have guided the photographer and he said: If you are to be a prince in today\u0027s world, she told him when he was young, you have to be a prince in your heart and actions. Since then, he says has lived life according to the spirit of the William Shakespeare quote from Henry VI, Part 3 that opens Lubomirski\u0027s book, Princely Advice for a Happy Life : My crown is in my heart, not on my head. The book has gathered celebrity fans, Kate Winslet said: This beautiful book, should become a bible for all! Without spiritual fluffiness, and free from preaching statements, this is a simple book of basic, gentle ideals that we sometimes forget about.

The manufacturer Celotex used extra fire retardant in the product that qualified for the safety certificate, it was claimed. A more flammable version of the insulation was then sold for public use, including the refurbishment of Grenfell, an investigation by BBC Panorama claims. Celotex said it could not comment because it is cooperating with the police investigation and the public inquiry. But the company has not denied any of the allegations. The RS5000 insulation gives off toxic fumes which contain cyanide when it burns. It is thought that all of the 72 people who died at Grenfell were killed by smoke. Celotex’s plastic foam insulation has been used on hundreds of other buildings around the country.   Fire safety expert Arnold Tarling said he was shocked by the allegation: “Well, words fail me. This is absolutely mind-blowing. This material is all over the place.” The alleged change in formula was not the only problem with the fire safety test that the insulation passed. The BS8414-2 test only showed RS5000 was safe to use on certain new build projects when it was combined with a specific fire-proof cladding panel. But Celotex allegedly knowingly misled buyers about RS5000. Its marketing suggested the insulation was suitable for use with other cladding panels and for tower block refurbishment projects like Grenfell, it is claimed. Neither was true, according to the BBC Panorama - Grenfell: Who Is To Blame? which is airing tonight. The company was repeatedly warned that its marketing was misleading, but it carried on mis-selling the product anyway- according to reports.

After Meghan is seen looking aghast, Alex turns to Gigi and says: Oh my gosh she totally saw you.  Laughing, Gigi replies: I know, she went and then pulls a shocked face with her mouth wide open.  Alex, who presents the weather on Good Morning Britain, shared the footage on Twitter saying he had asked Gigi just a few seconds before if she thought Meghan would recognise her.

Thomas Markle was spotted near his home in San Antonio Del Mar, Mexico, two days after his daughter tied the knot with Prince Harry in a fairytale ceremony. The 73-year-old was due to walk his daughter down the aisle but pulled out after reportedly suffering a heart attack and undergoing an emergency op.  He is said to have undergone surgery three days before Saturday\u0027s royal wedding , where Meghan, 36, officially joined the British Royal Family, becoming Duchess of Sussex.   Thomas Markle Sr was seen in public for the first time on Monday, clutching a plastic bag marked \u0027personal possessions\u0027, the Daily Mail reports .    Meghan reportedly didn\u0027t speak to father on her wedding day - but is believed to be planning a trip to visit him .   Meghan had just one member of her family there on the day - her yoga instructor mum, Doria Ragland .    US Weekly reported Meghan, 36, was not in touch with any other family members on her big day - including her dad Thomas.   However, Harry and Meghan are now believed to be discussing plans to visit him after their honeymoon, the Sun reports.   A family source told the paper the couple were devastated that he couldn\u0027t share their special day and have discussed seeing him soon as Meghan continues to worry about him and checks on him regularly.  The former lighting director revealed to American celebrity news site TMZ that he was watching the ceremony on TV, and found it emotional and joyful as his daughter married 33-year-old Prince Harry.  He told the site: My baby looks beautiful and she looks very happy.  I wish I were there and wish them all my love and happiness. Thomas made headlines in the weeks leading up to the wedding after agreeing to take part in a series of staged paparazzi shots. The images showed Thomas Markle admiring images of Meghan and Harry online and being fitted for a suit. Meghan and Harry married in front of 600 guests at St George\u0027s Chapel at Windsor Castle on Saturday.  They were later joined by 200 of their closest friends and family for a late-night afterparty where a DJ played house music and fireworks lit up the skies of Windor. Despite reportedly not being in touch with her dad on her wedding day, Meghan and Harry are said to be planning a trip to Mexico where they will visit Thomas Markle in hospital.  Kensington Palace released a statement from Meghan days before she tied the knot to Prince Harry, in which she said she has \u0027always cared for\u0027 her father.  She said: Sadly my father will not be attending our wedding.

Samantha, who has written a book on growing up with Meghan, has started using her former surname of Markle as opposed to Grant.

Lucy\u0027s Law is demanding a ban on the sale of puppies by pet shops and other third party commercial dealers, a trade fed by cruel puppy farms in the UK and abroad.  George Eustice, minister at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, gave a huge hint that Lucy\u0027s Law could become a reality, saying: “The Government considers there is merit in exploring this further”. He added that a final decision would be made after it has looked at the responses to the public consultation that closed on May 2. In a dramatic day for the campaign, Lucy\u0027s Law supporters including the Mirror handed the petition which has incredibly topped 143,000 signatures to Ten Downing Street. Campaign founder and award-winning vet Marc Abraham, standing outside Number Ten, said: “It\u0027s amazing how far we\u0027ve come with no resources, just compassion and empathy and making dogs the priority “I\u0027m incredibly proud of my team and everyone for signing and sharing the petition, change is long overdue and you are all making it happen.” The campaign is named after Lucy, a Cavalier King Charlies Spaniel saved from a rescue centre. Lucy was taken in by Lisa Garner and died in 2016.  “It\u0027s very emotional today because it\u0027s a day to remember Lucy and all she went through and but we\u0027re so close to change, it\u0027s that final push,” said Lisa, who now cares for another rescue dog, Plum Pudding. “Dogs lives are literally hanging in the balance, all the other Lucy\u0027s out there still need to be saved. “I never thought it would come as far as it has and it\u0027s all stemmed form one little dog called Lucy who I saw on a rescue centre website looking so tiny and vulnerable.” Also handing over the petition was Beverley Cuddy, editor of Dogs Today magazine. “I\u0027ve been writing about the third party sales of puppies for 28 years and this is the best shot we\u0027ve ever had of ending it,” she said. “This is our big chance today to put right something that\u0027s been wrong for decades.”  Another stalwart campaigner in Downing Street was Linda Goodman of CARIAD – Welsh for “beloved” and standing for Care and Respect Includes All Dogs. “I\u0027m incredibly hopeful,” she said. “Sometimes it\u0027s been like banging your head against a brick wall but now it feels like there\u0027s a door in the wall.” The astonishing success of the petition triggered a debate in Parliament, led by Scottish Nationalist Martyn Day, who told how an estimated 80,000 puppies are sold through third party dealers each year in the UK. “The sale of puppies through commercial third party dealers both sustains and is dependent upon the existence of puppy farms, where puppies are bred for maximum profit and minimal regard for animal welfare,” he said. He called the Lucy\u0027s Law e-petition “probably the most popular dog welfare petition the Government has seen in all time, I would extend my congratulations to all involved.”  Caroline Lucas for the Greens added: “One of the reasons this policy is so popular is that not only does it make good sense from an animal protection point of view, it\u0027s much easier to enforce that the current situation.” Lucy\u0027s Law has cross-party support, with Labour\u0027s Ann Clwyd telling MPs: “While we carry on talking, debating and procrastinating, dogs are suffering every minute of the day. “How much longer must they wait for us to end this barbaric third party puppy dealing? “I support Lucy\u0027s Law and if you really care, you will too.” Conservative Andrea Jenkyns said: “The public remain na\u0026iumlve to the horrors of the puppy farming trade, this is why legislation is necessary, not just to protect the puppies but their mothers too, and also the public from facilitating this abhorrent trade.”  Lisa Cameron, SNP, told how Lucy was exploited to within an inch of her life as “a breeding slave” before being rescued and becoming the mascot for all commercial breeding dogs. “The voices against Lucy\u0027s Law have now gone and paled into insignificance, we are speaking with one voice today, there is universal support for Lucy\u0027s Law. “For those organisations who say \u0027we\u0027d like a ban but not now,\u0027 I say, why not now? “If we wait a minute longer, more dogs like Lucy suffer absolutely appalling consequences.

No \u0026shyunauthorised videos or pictures were to emerge of the raucous party to end all parties. Only the couple\u0027s \u0027inner circle\u0027 - an exclusive 200-strong group - was invited to the Frogmore House knees-up. But here is a rundown of every last detail to escape the English country mansion. Guests reportedly supped on When Harry Met Meghan cocktails, played drinking games, danced with George Clooney and giggled at Meghan\u0027s overexcited pet dog. Meanwhile, prankster Prince William teased Harry over his thinning hair and attached a ladder to the couple\u0027s wedding car in a hilarious royal gag. Here is how Harry and Meghan celebrated in true A-lister style.  Who danced with who? Chat show superstar James Corden, who was compering the event, reportedly instigated a dance routine which featured Prince Charles, William and Harry. A source told the Sun: James \u0026shyCorden did his best to entertain and it went down an absolute treat. He even compered a dance-off between Harry, Charles and William. Everyone was laughing because it’s something no one expected. Meghan and her mum also joined in. Then everyone danced, which really kicked off the party.  The royal couple chose the Whitney Houston classic I Wanna Dance With Somebody as their first dance at the wedding bash. One of the 200 guests said: It wasn\u0027t \u0026shytraditional in the slightest. They went into a bit of a jive and a lindy hop. Hollywood actor George Clooney, 57, is also reported to have whisked Meghan and the Duchess of Cambridge away for a dance. But despite being one of world\u0027s the sexiest men, he did not get his own way with Fergie, who snubbed him when he asked for a quick spin on the dancefloor. Guests were given slippers to wear when their feet were tired from dancing. Actress Troian Bellisario, wife of Meghan\u0027s former on-screen husband Patrick J Adams in Suits, posted on Instagram: How amazing is this? Because these shoes have come off. They have slippers for us. \u0026shySlippers! I’m so ready.  What food and drink was served? The black-tie evening party was a sit-down dinner for 200 people. To provide the food, Harry and Meghan hired Clare Smyth, Britain\u0027s top chef and the first woman to hold three Michelin stars. The sit-down dinner was organic, sourced at the request of Prince Charles, and the light-bite canapes were themed \u0027spring meets summer\u0027. Guests were told to dress to the nines for a night of old-fashioned glamour and gallons of Pol Roger champagne.  A source told the Sun: There was a glass marquee for the dinner, festival-themed stalls and bars outside, with different themed drinks. There was a gin vermouth cocktail created for Charles and Camilla, who are both massive gin fans apparently. Also on the menu were candyfloss and \u0027dirty burgers\u0027 as midnight snacks, while one source reported a cocktail featuring ginger and rum was on the menu as a cheeky nod to Harry\u0027s red hair, named \u0027When Harry Met Meghan\u0027. Dozens of pizza boxes were spotted being hauled into in Windsor Castle on the night of the reception - but it later emerged they were for press accredited crew on the grounds. Who won the drinking games? The bride\u0027s US heritage was marked with the American drinking game beer pong, where players throw table tennis balls into cups of beers which their opponents then have to consume, according to reports. A reception insider said Serena Williams played the game like it was tennis.  What music did guests dance to? Celebrity DJ Sam Totolee, who was hired by Rod Stewart and Uma Thurman for their wedding receptions, was on the decks. Actor Idris Elba also took a turn at DJ\u0027ing, with a playlist filled with soul classics, 1960s R\u0026ampB and 1980s dance hits. A DJ who slipped his business card to Harry during a visit to Brixton also hinted that it worked and he secured the coveted commission to play at the do. Jevanni Letford posted a photograph Windsor with the caption: Calm before the excitement. At one point a grinning Harry is said to have turned to his guests, asking: \u0027Can anyone play the piano?\u0027 before Sir Elton John gave a moving medley of four hits - Your Song, Tiny Dancer, Circle Of Life and I\u0027m Still Standing.  Who gave a speech? Harry is reported to have told friends: You are the people that make \u0027me\u0027 me in my Harry life, which as you know is the backbone to Prince Harry. Now I’m going to hand over to my far better half… Meghan then gave a speech in which she thanked Prince Charles for walking her down the aisle and for such a warm welcome into the royal family. In Harry\u0027s speech, he said he was looking forward to spending the rest of my life with Meghan. But it was brother William, 35, who brought the house down in a joint speech with Harry’s best pal Charlie van Straubenzee.  They teased the groom about his thinning hair and told Meghan she was the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. One guest told the Sun: William managed to strike just the right balance between hilarious and solemn. He did mention their late mother, Princess Diana, and said how proud she would have been of her younger son. He said he was proud of Harry too and welcomed Meghan as the sister he never had and the best thing that had ever happened to Haz. But when he and Charlie got going, it was hilarious. They teased Harry about his growing bald patch and Wills said it would become as bad as his. It was some bash.  Proud dad Charles gave a speech at the earlier reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle. Talking about the man his son had become, he said: My darling old Harry, I’m so happy for you. Harry also gave a speech at the earlier reception. He moved guests to tears as he enthused about his beautiful wife, saying: We make such a great team. He is also said to have told Meghan, whose father could not attend the wedding because he was ill, that she navigated everything with such grace. Guest Suhani Jalota, who founded Mumbai charity Myna Mahila Foundation that Meghan visited last year, told Glamour Magazine the prince said: I’m so lucky to call this beautiful woman my wife now.  Was Meghan\u0027s dog at the reception? Meghan made sure her Guy played a part in her big day yesterday. And her beloved beagle proved to be one of the highlights of the night as he entertained wedding reception guests. The pet pooch had revellers in stitches as he caused chaos, running all over the place lapping up any spilled canapes. Meghan, the new Duchess of Sussex, brought Guy to Britain with her last year when she relocated from her home in Toronto.

Eight-year-old Saffie was one of 22 people killed in the suicide bombing at Ariana Grande’s concert a year ago today, while some 800 were injured. The victims of crazed terrorist Salman Abedi will be honoured in events across the nation, including a service at Manchester Cathedral and a mass singalong featuring more than 80 choirs. And Saffie’s dad Andrew, 44, said: “There are a lot of good people out there and we have been \u0026shyoverwhelmed by the love and support shown. “When an atrocity like this happens and people say, ‘This is wrong and we will support you’ it is a lovely feeling and it does help you in your darkest hours. We could not have done without the public and the support we have had. The support has been heartfelt and genuine and has come from across the world. It is lovely to know people were touched by Saffie and to feel their love for her.”  Saffie had gone to the concert with mum Lisa, 49, and sister Ashlee Bromwich, 25, who both suffered serious injuries in the blast. Lisa was told of her daughter’s death after waking from a coma. In the weeks that followed, the family’s chippy in Leyland, Lancs, became a sea of tributes to Saffie. But they have since moved, to a location they prefer not to reveal, as the memories were too painful. Speaking for the first time about their decision to relocate, Andrew said: “Our life, our home and our business were in Leyland and Saffie was such a huge character and a massive part of it. “To go back to that without her and to have those memories would have been too hard. Saffie spent a lot of time with customers and was known and loved in the area. Even walking around Tesco would have been difficult as we would have been expecting to see Saffie at every corner.  “We don’t ever want to forget Saffie but being in Leyland the memories would have been too painful. “We just wanted a fresh start – not to start again. There is no starting over after something like this. But to move away somewhere new and do our best to support each other.” Andrew said they had “seen the worst of human nature with what happened” but added: “Nothing will ever bring Saffie back but knowing the public is behind you restores your faith in human nature.” Paying tribute to his daughter, he said: “Saffie was the sort of person who just stopped people in their tracks. She was a \u0026shybeautiful young lady and not a day went by when we weren’t stopped by people complimenting her. “Saffie had a wicked sense of humour and this magic of capturing people.  “Saffie ruled our household – and she still does. We talk about Saffie all the time. We want to keep Saffie’s spirit alive so she is with us all the time.” Andrew is also full of pride for how son Xander, 12, has coped with their ordeal. He said: “Xander has had to move to a new area, left behind his friends and started a new school – all on top of losing his baby sister. “What happened is going to affect him for the rest of his life but he is keeping his chin up the best he can. Xander is a remarkable young man and we are very proud of him. We draw strength from each other.” The family this week finished a JustGiving appeal that raised \u0026pound11,000 to have a new kind of rose created in Saffie’s honour, with help from the Royal Horticultural Society. Lisa said the tribute, to be sold around the world to raise charity cash, would help her girl “live on for ever”. Many of Islamic State supporter Abedi’s victims were young people and 10 of those killed were under 20.  Prince William and the Prime Minister will attend the service at Manchester Cathedral tomorrow to remember them all, during which there will be a national minute’s silence at 2.30pm across Government buildings. The invitation-only event has been arranged for the families of those who lost their lives, first responders and civic leaders. But the public will be able to watch on a big screen in nearby Cathedral Gardens. The service will also be screened at York Minster, Liverpool politan Cathedral and Glasgow Cathedral. Tomorrow evening, The Manchester Survivors Choir, made up mostly of parents and children, will sing at the Manchester Together One Voice event in the city centre. Thousands of people are expected to join the mass singalong, for which more than 80 choirs will unite. They will be led by Dan McDwyer, the choirmaster who directed Parrs Wood High School in Didsbury in their moving tribute at the One Love Manchester concert. And church bells will ring out across the city at 10.31pm – the exact time the shrapnel-packed bomb was detonated at the arena. Anguished Paul: I\u0027d always stay yo help A year on from the Manchester bombing brave Paul Reid still bears the mental scars. The 44-year-old father was just yards from the foyer when the bomb went off. He gave life-saving first aid and used his own clothes to keep the victims warm. He calmed the youngest victim – eight-year-old Saffie Roussos – before helping her onto a makeshift stretcher.

The charismatic US preacher brought a flavour of Meghan\u0027s homeland to the ceremony with his powerful speech at St George\u0027s Chapel, in Windsor, on Saturday. His dramatic monologue raised a smile - and a few eyebrows - in the church, but the Queen remained straight-faced throughout. And Editor in Chief of Majesty Magazine Ms Seward said the Queen would have loved Bishop Curry\u0027s unorthodox delivery. Mainly because she was such a huge admirer of the late American evangelist Billy Graham.  The author told the Sun: The Queen has always enjoyed clergy that make her laugh - though not in public - and I suspect she will at some later stage provide some of her renowned mimicry of the occasion. She certainly enjoyed the company of evangelical US preacher the late Billy Graham who she met in 1956. He preached in her private chapel at Windsor on many occasions and even listened to her practise one of her Christmas speeches. Graham, who died earlier this year, had a friendly relationship with the Queen and was frequently invited by the Royal Family to special events. He first met the Queen in 1955 and preached at Windsor Chapel at her invitation the following year.    Their friendly relationship may have been because they shared a traditional approach to the practical aspects of the Christian faith. According to Ms Seward, the only reason the Queen did not smile at Bishop Curry\u0027s speech was likely to be because she never smiles in church. As the Supreme Governor of the Church of England, the monarch is deeply religious, and feels she must remain stern-looking. Bishop Curry - the first black presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal Church - gave an address titled the Power of Love at the service and spoke of poverty and justice. We must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love. And when we discover that, we will be able to make of this old world a new world. Love is the only way, Bishop Curry quoted.  And he said it was a real joyful thing to bring diversity to the ceremony.  He said: It was a real joyful thing because there was a sense in which you had the fullness of the church represented in many respects. Bringing everybody together, Bishop Curry said, happened today, in different ways, different songs, different perspectives, different worlds and all of it came together and gave God thanks. The speech was a lengthy one, with Bishop Curry appearing to tell himself to bring it to a close towards the end when he looked at the couple and said: We need to get y\u0027all married. Asked whether the address was planned or off-the-cuff, the Archbishop of Canterbury interjected, saying: Let\u0027s have an honest answer. It was planned and I thought it was going to be six minutes, Mr Curry said. It was a little longer than that because there were pauses in there, he added to laughter from the Most Rev Justin Welby.

John Purcell, 72, and his daughter, Catherine Purcell junior, 35, denied and were cleared of the manslaughter of their wife and mother, Catherine Purcell senior.  But the father and daughter were on Monday found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-grandmother, who died while being eaten alive by maggots, t he Liverpool Echo report s.  Paramedics found the victim’s body at the house she shared with her daughter in Shacklady Road, Kirkby, on Sunday, July 24, 2016.  Prosecutors said the 68-year-old died in a “cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid”, which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed. David McLachlan, QC, prosecuting, said the reaction burnt the skeletal victim’s skin and her infected body was then fed on by maggots. He argued during that the pair knew she was dying, but failed to seek medical aid, which three weeks beforehand would have saved her life. A post-mortem examination found Mrs Purcell died from pneumonia, dehydration and skin ulcers, including a hip ulcer penetrating to the bone. The victim, who weighed just five-and-a-half-stone, also had undiagnosed cancer of the tongue, which would have made swallowing painful.  Mr Purcell claimed he didn’t realise his wife was “severely malnourished”, or her stained legs covered in sores, despite changing her clothes. He accepted her bedroom was “disgraceful”, but said he didn’t know it was that filthy until she died, because the bed was covered by a duvet. Lawyers acting for Catherine jnr – who chose not to give evidence – said she was devoted to her mum, but let her “demanding” dad take over. Catherine jnr\u0027s sister Kellie, who lived nearby but had not visited her mother in six months, was not charged. Repeated messages between the two sisters about needing to wash their mother and clean her bed were shown to the court.  Jurors on Monday found Catherine jnr and her father John not guilty of manslaughter, but guilty of wilful neglect, after a 15-day trial and nearly 20 hours of deliberation. Mr Purcell showed no emotion, while Catherine jnr burst into tears, following the 10-1 majority verdicts, after one juror was discharged. High Court judge Mr Justice Holgate, sitting at Liverpool Crown Court, said the pair would be sentenced on June 18 and remanded them on bail. Mrs Purcell suffered from Korsakoff’s Syndrome, an alcoholism-related vitamin deficiency disease, resulting in chronic memory problems.  Catherine jnr, whose son, then aged 11, also lived at the house, was her mum’s carer and received \u0026pound62 per week in carer\u0027s allowance. Prosecutors said the victim was estranged from her husband, of Quarry Green, Kirkby, but he still visited daily and often slept over. The couple had two other children, John junior and Kellie, the latter who lived nearby with her partner Darren Moore and three children. During the harrowing trial into the death of Mrs Purcell, Mr McLachlan read out messages retrieved from the defendants’ mobile phones. Kellie, who the court heard had not visited the house for six months, was not charged with any offences.  Here are the conversations in full between Catherine jnr (CP) and Kellie (KP) during July 2016, with oswearing and children’s names removed.

The biker captured the shocking footage on his helmet cam as he cycled home from work on a canal towpath in Tyseley on Friday afternoon. Video reveals how the trio of hooded men lay in wait amongst foliage situated along a canal at around 3.30pm.  One of the group is seen jumping from the tree cover brandishing a large stick and swings it forwards, the Birmingham Mail reports .   Thankfully the cyclist, who has not been named, noticed the threat early and slowed down before he reached their hiding place.

The 41-year-old, who works at a Yardley packing company, told how the incident had left him shaken.   I had my backpack, helmet camera and was cycling on my bike on my commute from work to home.

The former Labour Health Secretary was still finding his feet outside the Westminster bubble when Manchester’s worst peace-time atrocity claimed 22, mostly young, lives, and left an entire region shell-shocked. As the world’s media focused on Manchester’s grief and its people sought direction, the mayor went through the full range of emotions. Every hour, he said, seemed like a day. Initially, he felt an overwhelming sense of sadness, and not a little fear. Then, after a vigil he had organised saw Mancunian defiance come to the fore, pride and humility replaced the fear. As names and faces were put to corpses, and small coffins were carried at funerals, St Ann’s Square became a shrine and Don’t Look Back In Anger was adopted as the city’s anthem, Burnham struggled to articulate what it all meant.  Until, a few months later, at a homelessness event in Piccadilly Gardens, these lyrics, sung by an unknown band called Prose, knocked him sideways:  Manchester has lost its sound, the kids, the kids that can’t be found,   and there’ll never be a day that goes on where I say,   I won’t be carrying this weight in my heart,   remembering the place where I was when things changed,   and the world started falling apart.   Manchester has fell to its knees in the bedlam we forget to breathe   the city that’s never asleep loses its legs for a second and grieves,   and we get to our feet, build up our strength and we help the bereaved   and stand up together we’re stronger than ever,   our hearts and our heads are the weapons we need, we will not accept this is any defeat.  Burnham, 48, says: “It summed up everything I’d felt. Manchester had lost its sound. The day after the bomb, it was deadly quiet and jittery. It felt momentarily winded and unable to respond. But then it did and its response was magnificent.”  May 22, 2017, had been an ordinary Monday evening for Burnham. It was his dad’s birthday, so he dropped round a bottle of wine, then played five-a-side football, went home and switched on Newsnight. Then his phone rang. It was great friend and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram asking what was happening at the Arena, where his daughters had gone to see Ariana Grande. The next call told Burnham it was a terror alert. He says: “I felt sick to the pit of my stomach. I decided not to go to the Arena while everything was unfolding, but to stay at home and gather my thoughts.” The next morning, he stood at the town hall telling the world that after the darkest of nights, Manchester had woken to the most difficult of dawns. He says: “It certainly felt like the darkest night I’d ever had. They were a hard few hours when I kept asking myself, ‘How will this place respond?’”  He and the Manchester City Council leader Richard Leese decided to hold a “vigil of peace” that evening in Albert Square. On social media, the far right accused them of lighting candles as terrorists planned a next attack. That angered Burnham. “We weren’t saying, ‘Light a candle and love each other’, we were saying, ‘Be proud, don’t let anything change you, don’t lose confidence’. “When Tony Walsh read his poem This Is The Place, the mood completely changed. Mancunians had found their voice. That vigil massively helped set the tone.” He was also in St Ann’s Square when the mass rendition of Oasis hit Don’t Look Back in Anger broke out. He says: “Hearing that build was just amazing. It showed that for all our challenges our biggest asset is our people.  “We saw it in the immediate aftermath, when Muslim taxi firms gave free rides. Something phenomenal came out of that terrible night. The sense of solidarity was summed up by the ‘worker bee’ symbol being adopted. It’s an emblem of Manchester and it says that no one is bigger than the whole.” There were 14,200, mostly teenage girls, trying to get out of the Manchester Arena when suicide bomber Salman Ramadan Abedi, 22, detonated an explosive device, killing 22 people and injuring more than 500. At the time Burnham described the attack as “an act of pure evil”. Does he still think that? “Yes. This individual grew up here. To commit that act in a place where he knew there was an \u0026shyaudience of teenage girls was pure, vindictive and unremitting evil.” "},{"url":null,"title":"two teen boys accused planning","story":"NewsTwo teen boys accused of planning school shooting \u0027fail to give evidence\u0027 as \u0027they can\u0027t answer case\u0027Their plan to murder teachers and pupils at their school in Northallerton, North Yorks, was “real-life intent”, a jury was told\u0026nbspShareByHenry Clare22:20, 21 MAY 2018NewsCourt sketch of the teens (Image: Priscilla Coleman/MB Media)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo boys of 15 accused of plotting a Columbine High School-style massacre failed to give evidence as they “can’t answer the prosecution’s case”, a court heard.

This whole week will be largely dry, warm and sunny with temperatures hovering in the low to mid 20s, several degrees warmer than the May average, the Met Office said.   The balmy conditions have swept in on a high pressure system, dragging in hot air from the continent, meteorologist Greg Dewhurst said.  And on bank holiday Monday, temperatures in most places will easily climb into the low 20s with London set for a scorching 25C, according to The Weather Channel. These warm and settled conditions should continue for most of the day, however, the outlook is more changeable for north-west Scotland and Ireland. There is also a risk of some isolated thunderstorms across central and southern England throughout the week as the humid blast arrives from France and Spain.  It will also be a wet start to the week for Northern Ireland and western Scotland, but the showers and clouds should largely clear by Wednesday. And as the days progress it will grow cooler along the North Sea coasts owing to a northeasterly wind. Mr Dewhurst said: On Sunday we had a high of 24C and that was in Sheffield, and the day before we had 23C. Usually in May we expect highs of around 17C. Temperatures in the low to mid 20s should continue for this week, with quite widespread warmth across the country. But an easterly wind will make it feel a bit cooler across the North Sea coast as we move on. UV (ultra violet) levels are generally high across the UK as well, so people should make sure they\u0027re protected from the sun.  A spokesperson for The Weather Channel also said it would also be a dry and bright run up to the holiday weekend with temperatures above normal. “High pressure will persist resulting in a cool onshore wind from the North Sea for eastern Britain and coastal areas may be affected by low cloud and sea mist at times, they said. “Inland and especially to the west, dry and sunny conditions are forecast. “In the afternoon heat, a scattering of showers and isolated thunderstorms may develop over southern Britain on most days, the spokesperson added. Meanwhile, bookmaker Coral makes it odds on at 4-5 that 2018 goes on to be the hottest year on record amid a flurry of bets.

The impact of the weather and money worries also appeared at the top of the poll, with finances also plaguing our minds when our eyes open. Others declared that checking social media and \u0027group chat\u0027 is their number one priority in the morning. It also emerged Brits are stirred from their sleep ahead of the alarm by work woes at least twice a week. Despite being a nation of early risers, getting out of bed at an average time of 6.16am on a workday, it will take 29 minutes before we feel fully awake, alert and ready to start the day.  The average adult also takes 62 minutes to get ready in the morning, from the second they wake up to the moment they step out the door, according to the study. As a result, 36 per cent spend more than half of the working week feeling rushed and pressured for time. And 58 per cent feel “overwhelmed” with the number of tasks on their to-do list when contemplating the day ahead. Worryingly, two in five of the 2,000 surveyed feel they do not take care of themselves in the morning – skipping breakfast and exercise, and forgetting to take their vitamins. A spokesperson for The New York Bakery Co, which commissioned the study, said: “Mornings can be a hectic time, especially with pressures hitting us first thing, such as getting the kids ready for school or making it to work on time.  “It seems many of us leave just enough time to get the morning essentials done, while neglecting what we see as luxuries, like making time for breakfast or a quick session at the gym ahead of the work day.” Breakfast is also the most neglected meal of the day, with seven in 10 Brits dedicating more care to lunch and dinner. In fact, just 11 minutes each day will be dedicated to breakfast each day on average. And more than one in 10 confessed they don’t have time for breakfast AT ALL due to the daily rat race. Nearly a quarter of the UK’s workforce are forced to eat their first meal of the day ‘on-the-go’, utilising their morning commute, or while at their desk. Breakfast options lacking in excitement were on the menu for most, with a third quickly scoffing a bowl of cereal and one in eight opting for a slice of buttered toast. But due to time constraints we will skip breakfast once a week in order to fit everything into our busy morning schedules.

He initiated my passion for music,\u0026#8221 the 45 from Dundee said.\u0026#8220I started playing at just five years of age or so. My dad once overheard me playing simple tunes on a little toy tune percussion that I was given for my birthday.\u0026#8220My father found the musical talent in me and decided to buy me my own real accordion.

She was the main factor that really pulled me into teaching others.\u0026#8220As a teacher or instructor I not only help students to progress in their musicianship or instrumental skills , but also have a huge impact on their personality and help to shape their character. Seeing my own student’s progress and a smile on their face is the biggest reward any teacher can get.\u0026#8221\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afc0004b7cc0-745x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people nurses across dundee and tayside celebrate international nurses day","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNursing staff across Tayside marked International Nurses Day.

Ross County to secure Fraser Fyvie on a two-year deal.The 25-year-old missed the second half of the season with a serious knee ligament injury.Even so, with his contract up at the end of the month the Staggies had been keen to poach him from Tannadice as they battle to get back up to the Premiership next term.The Tangerines, however, have persuaded the former Aberdeen, Wigan and Hibs man to stay with them.They recognised it was with him anchoring their midfield they played their best football this season and were determined to keep him.“Fraser’s performances and professionalism were clear to me when I became manager and he is an important player for us,” said gaffer Csaba Laszlo.“Him signing is excellent news as we build our squad ahead of the 2018/19 season.”Fyvie himself made it clear his first option was always to stay where he was.“I am delighted to continue my career here at United.“I was enjoying my football last season, and the club has been excellent during my rehab,” he said.“As I continue towards full fitness again, I cannot wait to get back out playing for United.”Fyvie’s stats for last season show why United were so desperate to hang on to him.Fifteen of his 17

Tangerines.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afe9b8f2158c-e1526636734395-837x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united signing spree set to kick off this weekend","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are closing in on the first of what could be as many as 17 signings over the summer.Such is the extent of the planned overhaul of the Tangerines squad, they’re set to continue beyond the start of the season in July.So far no clues as to who’s on the wanted list have been forthcoming from Tannadice.But the Tele understands talks with at least two targets are at an advanced stage and deals could be struck over the weekend.Dunfermline pair Fraser Aird and Nicky Clark could be on the verge of joining up.While United have declined to confirm their interest in Clark, the 26-year-old’s proven scoring record at Championship level is something of which they are aware.And despite interest in him from the Premiership – St Mirren have also been linked – a determined effort to get him to Tannadice appears to be ongoing.Ex-Hamilton defender Ziggy Gordon is also on their radar and he could be fixed up soon.With other identified targets, the process could take longer.While the departures of 14 players means replacements are needed, and soon, as much time as is needed to ensure the right quality is obtained for next season will be taken.With the season just over, a number of players and agents are on their summer break and that will delay some business. In other cases, the calibre of those involved means United will battle with other clubs to get them.The fact they are remaining outside of the Premiership for a third season running makes that task harder – but it’s not being seen as an insurmountable one.And the number of players who’ve expressed an interest in hearing what the plans for the new-look squad are has been encouraging.There will be action at Tannadice tonight as Dave Bowman’s annual match to raise cash for skin cancer and dementia charities takes place.It will see a string of other past Tangerines greats turning out in the home ranks.“We’ve got the usual list of suspects and Sean Dillon and Jon Daly will be back in United strips as well,” said Bow.“We’ve even got your columnist in the Tele, big Lee Wilkie, playing. Before he agreed to turn out he did check we have XXXL shorts for him to wear.”The opposition is made up of fans who’ve bid to play against their past heroes. The action kicks off at 6.30pm and entry is free.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united stick by crocked keeper mehmet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United have offered crocked keeper Deniz Mehmet the chance to stay with them as he battles for fitness next season.The 25-year-old suffered a serious knee problem when he picked up a bizarre injury in the Premiership play-off quarter-final victory over Dunfermline at Tannadice earlier this month.He suffered knee ligament damage as he jumped in delight to celebrate Scott McDonald’s equaliser early in the second half of the second leg that United went on to win 2-1.With the one-year contract he signed when joining up from Falkirk last summer up at the end of the month, that put a question mark over his future with the Tangerines.But manager Csaba Laszlo is sticking by the man he made No 1 late in the season.He has been told a new deal is waiting for him to sign.Even if the former Turkish youth international decides his long-term future lies elsewhere, United will see he is put through his operation and provide the facilities for him to complete his rehab programme.That process is likely to take until the end of the year at least but he did enough in 13 first-team games this season for United to be more than happy to keep him.With the other first-team goalie, Harry Lewis, returning to parent club Southampton at the end of his season-long loan, at least one of the as many as 17 signings made this summer will be an experienced No 1.Meanwhile, the latest discount period for season tickets for the 2018/19 campaign comes to an

Record for the number of people wearing sunglasses in one location – using #SunnyDundee specs.Sizzling plans to put the current record in the shade have been backed by the campaign group.Organisers of Westfest approached the group about the idea of using the yellow sunglasses emblazed with #SunnyDundee.Campaign manager Jennifer Caswell, from Dundee – One City, Many Discoveries, said she would never have thought about making a record-breaking attempt when the campaign started in April.She said an estimated 5,000 #SunnyDundee glasses have already been distributed.Dundonians wearing the glasses have been pictured basking in the sun both at home and abroad, including New York, Singapore and Austria.Westfest, which is expected to welcome more than 10,000 revellers on Sunday June 3, could be the ideal location for the record attempt.Jennifer added: “Westfest organisers approached us about the idea.“Given there are more than 5,000 shades out there, we would certainly encourage revellers who have a pair to bring them along.“The campaign has been incredible so far.“Dundee has really got on board with it, especially taking pictures and uploading them online.“We’ve seen pictures from Austria recently on social media.“Throughout the whole campaign, I would never have envisaged a record-breaking attempt.“I’ve been down to Westfest in previous years and it’s a great atmosphere and a great idea.”A Westfest spokesman said: “All of us are hugely excited by the prospect of attempting to break a record for wearing sunglasses.“We can confirm we are investigating the possibility and are in the process of contacting Guinness World Records to find out the exact world record as it stands as we try to arrange an official attempt.“Westfest has previously basked in sunny weather. It would be a joy to see 5,000 bright yellow sunglasses on the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Everything drivers need to know about today s Race for Life road closures","story":"                          GLASGOW will be transformed into a sea of pink today\u0026nbspas the annual Race for Life event gets underway."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7812353.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Gers fan s tweet goes viral after he posts picture of Kenyan local in old football shirt","story":"                          A Rangers\u0026nbspfan\u0026nbspwho\u0026nbspposted a picture of a Kenyan local sporting one of his team\u0027s\u0026nbspold\u0026nbsptops\u0026nbsphas seen his tweet go viral.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7813727.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Married life begins for Harry and Meghan after fairytale ceremony","story":"                          Newlyweds\u0026nbspHarry\u0026nbspand Meghan begin their first day as a married couple after tying the knot during an emotional wedding ceremony that captivated the nation."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7813739.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"What do drivers need to know about the MOT change ","story":"                          The way the\u0026nbspMOT\u0026nbspworks in Britain has changed.

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community.
