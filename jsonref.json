(Picture: YouTube)It’s one of the oldest Eurovision Song Contest tropes going: Countries vote for their neighbours and no-one likes the United Kingdom so we can’t win.It was rolled out again by Phillip Schofield this week as he interviewed SuRie ahead of her flight out to Lisbon, but its an ill-informed myth. In fact, the United Kingdom has won the Eurovision Song Contest more than any country except Ireland and Sweden.Switzerland and Austria have plenty of neighbours, but they’ve often finished low down the scoreboard. This year both Zibbz from Switzerland and Cesar Sampson from Austria are targeting a place in the Eurovision Song Contest final.This Morning presenter Philip Schofield spoke to SuRie before she flew to Lisbon (Picture: BBC)After completing their second round of rehearsals, they’re getting ready for the live shows next week. They perform in the first jury final on Monday where 50 per cent of the votes will be decided. The live TV show of Eurovision semi-final one is on Tuesday 8 May, and that’s where the public vote.MORE: Check out the Zibbs rehearsal of Stones on the Eurovision stage in LisbonMORE: Check out Austria\u0027s incredible rehearsals on the 2018 Eurovision StageToday, Zibbz and Cesar Sampson have released a mashup from a jam session on the official Eurovision channel and it shows them performing both Stones and Nobody But You together. It’s awesome:When artists get exposure across international borders, it often translates into votes. Where musical cultures are similar, that results in people voting for songs and artists they’ve already known.This happens every year with Greece and Cyprus and the former Yugoslavian countries, where the singers are already well known and the song are already hits before Eurovision.Norway’s Alexander Rybak and Sweden’s Bengamin Ingrosso also joined up to do some cross-border promotion ahead of this year’s Eurovision Song Contest.Eurovision is big business in Scandinavia and they all have weekly preview shows. Artists regularly appear on the biggest chat shows. That’s the real reason why you’ll see Nordic nations giving points to artists they already know and like.Both Norway and Sweden are serious Eurovision heavyweights this year and could be taking the Contest back to Scandinavia for 2019.Alexander Rybak’s That’s How You Write A Song has moved up to second favourite in the betting odds as he aims to become only the second man in history to win the Eurovision Song Contest twice. His Eurovision odds are down to 51 and falling fast. after completing his second rehearsal today.MORE: Norway show\u0027s how to write a Eurovision song and perform it to perfection in LisbonMORE: Can Sweden make it 7th heaven at Eurovision this year?

If he wins, it won’t be political, it will because his international fan base pick up the phone and vote for a great song."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/kate-oates-e1525263167788.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"coronation street boss kate oates clarifies her exit decision reveals huge spoilers and addresses backlash","story":"(Picture: ITV)Coronation Street chief Kate Oates may have overseen a very busy era for the thriving soap – not only has it increased its episode output to six weekly editions and expanded its set, adding an entire new street – but ratings have increased massively and the reach to 16-34 year olds is the highest since 2006. No mean feat considering the competition from Netflix, catch-up TV and hundreds of channels. Her stay at the Street has not been without heavy discussion, with some questioning whether her approach to darker storytelling suits the show but there can be no denying that more people are watching than ever and she leaves the show in a much stronger state than she found it.As she heads on to pastures new and takes over prime time drama Bancroft, we sat down for a good chat with Kate about her time in the show, her final storylines coming up and also allowed her the chance to set the record straight on her departure and have her final thoughts on the ‘is Corrie too dark?’ debate.I was most nervous about what we talk about when we tackle a story like this – imitative behaviour which is someone doing it because they have seen it. I took some private, personal advice on that from a couple of friends who work in mental health.I also just had to think about my own experiences with my training with Samaritans. I also strongly believe that not talking about it isn’t working so I went through a whole process and had to think “how would I feel if…?” But I think it’s more important to raise the subject and try something else.Yeah, I’m all right about that side of things – I have gone from being very thin skinned to much thicker skinned! I have been asked by a researcher before appearing on Lorraine whether there were any low points to my time on the show and I thought “actually, no – without wishing to sound too twee about it, it all helps and it all counts and I will use it all in my career at some point”. I am very well supported – so many nice people have my back.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision(Picture: ITV)It kind of almost collided by accident to be honest – all of those issues with male mental health. Sometimes as a producer you would think “hang on, we’ve got a lot of stories that cover that vibe at the moment” – but that was a really good thing. We decided to cluster them and talk about it from all different angles because it is important and the figures are staggering and they are tragic.Things do need to change. I find it interesting that they are all different men with very different issues and approaches to life. Their support networks are all very different and in some cases those support networks work brilliantly and in others, people don’t know there is a problem.This is true to life. They all felt like natural character trajectories – the characters all held up to these journeys and as a theme for the show, it worked quite well.Not particularly – I still think it should be story led. With Donna in Emmerdale for example, when I spoke to Verity, she was brought back to play this final story – it was Ross’ and Marlon’s story really. Whenever you kill a character, it has to be more about the story that is left behind. For example, a character like Katie – Sammy is a brilliant actor who had been in the show for ages and also a really good friend – what that story gave was year’s worth of story for Robert and Aaron. Sammy had made the decision to go and it’s about what powers us forward – you always have to be thinking when you have six episodes to fill, what is going to drive that narrative.I was aware of the number but if I look at each of them inidually, I can justify every single one – I don’t think any of them were wasted deaths and all of the actors rose to the challenge. I have always worked with people who were gracious and generous – they always come in and do the job, even if it is challenging. There hasn’t been the same level of mortality in Weatherfield – but the key thing is about what it gives you afterwards. We’re not trigger happy, I promise – we always consider each death carefully.Yes. I suppose a way you could look at it is I could have completely avoided it if I wanted to – plenty of producers don’t want to get involved or talk to the press and that’s completely fine that’s their wand. In a social media society we live in, people always have an opinion on everything – sometimes the things I have responded to, I have got a dry sense of humour – sometimes when people are mean about me on Twitter, I have my own methods on how I might deal with that (laughs). But that’s just because that’s just how I respond to certain opinions.What I have been grateful for from the press is being able to have the chance to explain something or put something in context. In theory, drama shouldn’t have to explain itself because people watch it and it should exist on its own merit. But sometimes it’s nice to give context and explain where we are coming from and what we hope to achieve.It has been a bit of a surprise but I am very well supported and it has taught me a lot about resilience. I feel a little bit tougher that I did two years ago and that’s okay – I also understand that it’s part of the game I’m never necessarily playing a game but I do have a job to do and have to tell stories important to me and I know that others have to create their own careers off of that too.I think there will be a lot less interest in me and that’s no bad thing. I think it’s important to remember that out of the millions of Coronation Street viewers, the overwhelming majority haven’t got a clue who I am. There is a small percentage of people who do – most people don’t care and just care about the drama in front of them.With any drama, some people will immerse themselves and want to know all the IMDB credentials and some people couldn’t care less.When Iain MacLeod is here, he will have the same kind of thing I imagine and I am sure he will handle it brilliantly and I am looking forward to just concentrating on the script and the story. But as I say, sometimes it’s a luxury to be able to speak publicly and clarify things so it’s a double edged sword and I am very comfortable with that.Yes, you have to leave stuff in the story cupboard – I did that in Emmerdale with my team. The Ashley story was started under me but don’t forget, that was pitched by Maxine Alderton, that wasn’t my idea.Robron was also something I was able to leave and that’s something which grows which is fantastic. What I like about Iain and his work and why I’ll be interested in his work at Corrie – he did things with those stories that I wouldn’t have done.The Ashley point of view episode, I could watch that as a creative piece and think “hats off, I would never have thought of that”.I think that’s why he has succeeded with those stories and why I can watch him as a creative in his own right and think – “okay, that’s exciting!” I am sure he will do the same at Corrie. For my professional sensibilities, I want to leave good stuff and be proud when I go – don’t forget, my stuff will have my name on it ’til the autumn it’s my reputation and I care very deeply about that.But I care very deeply about the show as well and I have said before, you only look after these programmes for a period of time and then you hand them on.That is very much the job – if you just want to burn through stuff just to put your name on it, you won’t make many friends.MORE: Coronation Street’s male suicide story for Aidan Connor is a brave and necessary move that will save lives(Picture: ITV)I suppose all I would say is that I am sad that they were conflated because from my point of view and my bosses’ points of view, that genuinely wasn’t the case.Anyone who thinks that I pay too much attention to controversy hasn’t been paying much attention to the way I work and what I do. It’s pretty clear that I don’t cave easily and I love my job and I have been so privileged to do it. I genuinely don’t mind the stuff that comes out around it – it’s all part of the beast that is Coronation Street.I am really excited about the next job and I know that I will look back on this period of my life and be choked by how lucky I have been to do it. I come out feeling robust and hungry for the next thing.I love that soap can do that so I absolutely would work on soap again because I love the pace and I love how people talk about it. I feel very comfortable in it, I understand it, I like the people who work in it, I like the people who write about it – I just like it. So of course.One of the things I am most proud of is when you look at our reach of 16-34 year olds a couple of weeks ago around the big Phelan stuff, it was higher than it had been since 2006. That is pre Netflix, pre tablets and all of that kind of stuff – we have all of that competition now and yet it was still higher than in 2006. That makes me think, brilliant! The future of soap is just about people rising to the challenge – you’ve got to roll with the punches.When the network says, we want six a week – I left Emmerdale when it was doing seven a week – the figures were fantastic. So you go “all right, let’s do this. We need to have an extra meeting this week, we have to make sure these stories are at the top of their game. We have to justify it.” There is a side of it which means that people in my job – I don’t want to say burn out as that sounds negative – but reach the end of the process for themselves.Maybe that happens a little sooner but I think the shows are guarding against that – when you look at what Emmerdale is doing at the moment, there’s a couple of producers running it. Jane Hudson is incredible and I have worked with both Kate and Laura and they are amazingly talented, creative women.(Picture: ITV)That’s all about ensuring there is energy and creative ideas coming through all the time. The production side will have to evolve slightly, the writers will just have to keep bringing it and I think the viewers also have to allow the changes to happen organically but equally, we need to listen to their critique. It doesn’t just Teflon off me when people say it’s not funny or warm anymore or we miss this or that – we do really think about it and we try very hard.Those critiques have helped me through my whole process here and have been very valuable to me but I do think soap has a good future because I am leaving the show with the ratings in good form and higher than when I got here and when I get frustrated about negative press, that’s what I want to say – the ratings are higher, it’s sort of end of discussion, they’re the facts!If I was leaving the show with declining ratings, I might have given a different answer but I’m not – and I have enjoyed every moment. And there’s been such a great team around me, it’s not just me.Oh I thought you meant when I “snapped” at Holly! My boyfriend was sitting at home saying “that’s not Kate snapping!” (laughs). Well, Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby are coming in for a bit of fun and part of Helen Flanagan’s exit story.We’re kind of replaying a bit of a trick we have used before because Rosie has already been on shows but it will be great comedy.Phil and Holly will play themselves – I had a couple of hopes where I thought I could get them to slightly play against type! They’re such good sports – I am very happy. That’s the benefit of being in a big production company like ITV – I know Emma Gormley who runs daytime – she’s an amazing, successful person and a good friend of mine so I was able to give her a ring and she said: “yeah, that sounds fun!”I would love that! I think he would kick ass.(Picture: ITV)We have some amazing stuff with Jim McDonald. He’s going to be coming back with a lot of resentment because of what Steve did – from his point of view, he has been rotting in prison and no one cares. We also played a story 18 months ago where it seemed like Steve might have inherited a genetic disease from his dad but no one went to see Jim to ask if he was okay. We have a great story to play with that.Things get massive for the Metcalfes – they will be big right up until Christmas. I can’t promise they will still be the Christmas story as Iain is taking over from me but they have huge material for them that will see Tim and Sally at their best.We have Lewis – king of cads! He is returning – I would have him for as long as Nigel Havers would want to stay as he works brilliantly with Sue Nicholls and I love that existing dynamic that he played both mother and daughter. It’s perfect and I love everything that they have done with Sophie Thompson as none of them have overplayed it.I was anxious about that story as it’s about a medium talking about Richard Hillman. If you are going to tell that truthfully, you have a woman whose husband was a serial killer, then you have a stranger coming in but you’re playing it for laughs – how can you expect Helen Worth to play that honestly? But the writers were brilliant and were able to unfold it so it feels very truthful in the moment and we will just spin it in a bit of a different way after that. Sophie does everything with integrity – she was perfect for it.We also have Steve and Tracy – you’ve got to love it. I see them as a bit of a fiery Jack and Vera. They fit into old school Corrie but they are not old school actors – they are fresh with it. Kate Ford benefits from a much more rounded type of storytelling. She is fantastic.  When you look back at the layers she has played alongside Deirdre, Blanche, Amy, Steve and so many other relationships, there is such depth to this character. We can still see the darker side of Tracy, she’s still a superbitch – but a much more believable one.(Picture: ITV)I always liked their reunion. I didn’t always have Steve and Tracy in my head – it came about later in the day – but I always had it in my head that Steve and Michelle couldn’t see out his indiscretion. His thing with Leanne was a story I inherited – it gave me lots of mileage. What we played was Michelle losing that child and then the truth coming out – and what happens after that? Kym and Simon work brilliantly together but I just don’t believe she would forgive him after that – the dynamic needed to break up because of that and we had to go with something else. I can’t pretend that Steve and Tracy was my game plan from the start but it has grown and I think it works.Again, I probably refer back to my earlier comment about not being afraid of controversy – it’s more important to reflect the truth. If you tie things up with a bow, there’s a danger people take away from that: “it’s all right then, we don’t need to talk about this anymore, it’s done.” But it’s not done. There are lots of things within that story that we couldn’t show on screen. If I were going to show that story in court, I’d have been fascinated to have played the truth of it – I hope he doesn’t mind me name dropping here but I am really good friends with (Judge) Robert Rinder and I talked to him about the story and he spoke to me about how he might cross-examine someone on the stand or how someone else might.Rob is a massive supporter of the storyline – he’s a great friend and sounding board. Duncan Craig from Survivors Manchester did the same when he took us through the kinds of questions someone might be faced with on the stand. It’s hard and it’s brutal and you question whether we are set up in the best place to get these convictions? If it were a 9pm drama and we saw David Platt on the stand talking about what had happened to him, a barrister might cross examine him with a huge level of detail to try and discredit him – it is really intimate and makes you think “I never thought about it that way and how it could be spun”.I think it’s important not to artificially tie things up – I believe that David’s perpetrator wouldn’t be convicted in this instance. David got rid of all of the evidence. We will have to tie the storyline off – it will find an ending which will surprise people. David will get a catharsis and some acknowledgement but he might not get that legally. In soap, a lot of the justice often comes from the community – Phil Collinson used to call it the court of Coronation Street and I completely get that.(Picture: ITV)I can say that Phelan was biblical on those sea walls – he imposes his own biblical imagery and there is definitely that in his exit. We have collided stories like we did last May with Who Pushed Ken, Bethany’s story and Nick’s exit. We’re doing that again – they’re the richest stories for me. It’s difficult in these set weeks when there’s one event and everything else feels like you are just waiting for the moment – Connor gives it his all as always it’s such a good week, I’m proud of it.That’s a great question to end on but also the hardest. In a way, it all passes in a blur – it’s so busy. Without wanting to sound twee, it’s such an incredible experience – there aren’t many people as privileged to have done what I have been doing. If you had asked me ten years ago if I’d be doing this job, I’d have laughed and hidden and not thought it were possible – I’m so lucky. I feel incredibly lucky and I look back on it with nothing but fondness – even the challenging bits.MORE: 10 Corrie spoilers: Aidan suicide death, David Platt’s rape reveal and Bethany’s romance decision"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/954573250.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"david haye just ten pounds heavier tony bellew rematch","story":"Tony Bellew and David Haye weigh in ahead of Saturday (Picture: Getty)A lean David Haye weighed in just ten pounds heavier than Tony Bellew for their rematch.Haye was almost a stone heavier than Bellew for their previous encounter 14 months ago, but tipped the scales at 15st 10lbs 2oz (220lbs) ahead of their second encounter.Bellew too was aiming to be lighter for the showdown and he weighed in at 15st 4oz (210lbs).Bellew and Haye enjoyed an amicable final face-off compared to the melee at yesterday’s press conference.There were no punches thrown this time, but there were plenty of words exchanged as Haye hurled insults at a smiling Bellew."},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10363174.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"kendall jenner frees nipple rocks lace dress swanky tiffany party","story":"Kendall Jenner opted for a see-through dress (Picture: Getty)Kendall Jenner rocked a see-through dress as she headed out in New York.The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star looked incredible as she attended the launch of Tiffany \u0026amp Co.’s Paper Flowers jewellery collection – freeing the nipple in a white mini-dress.And she was joined by some famous faces for the lavish bash, including Cara Delevingne and rumoured girlfriend Paris Jackson.But, while eyes may have been on Kendall’s slightly transparent dress, or those very see-through heels, we have some serious questions about her mini handbag.Kendall looked incredible in the risque outfit (Picture: Getty)Like, what do you even put inside it?And where do you keep your phone, gum, lipstick, and Oyster Card?Kylie Jenner’s sister recently made headlines after opening up about her sexuality, putting all those rumours about her dating life to bed once and for all.Speaking to Vogue, the 22-year-old explained whether she identifies as gay or bi, explaining: ‘I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know!

She and Meghan are famously close, with pictures of Doria, Meghan and Harry at the Invictus Games before the announced their engagement proving their solid relationship.Prince Harry chats to Doria Ragland in September 2017 at the Invictus Games closing ceremony, two months before the pair became engaged (Picture: Canadian PressREXShutterstock)Amid the speculation that Thomas wasn’t even coming, it was also reported that Doria would instead take on the important duty.It was even claimed, at one stage, that Prince William could be in line to walk his future sister-in-law down the aisle.As Prince Harry’s elder brother and the future King, it wouldn’t be too strange for Meghan to be lead to Harry by William.Will William walk Meghan down the aisle on her wedding day? (Picture: MEGAPA)When King George VI – Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret’s father – died in 1952, Princess Margaret married eight years later and didn’t have her father to walk her down the aisle.The Queen’s husband Prince Philip, who she had been married to for 13 years before her younger sister married, stepped in and escorted his sister in law down the aisle.If Prince William were to have echoed what his grandfather did for his great aunt, it would have been a nod to the history of the Royal Family, as well as their traditions.While Kensington Palace has never commented on speculation over which of Meghan’s family members are invited to the royal wedding, it’s understood her sister-in-law, nephew and step-brother Tom Markle Junior are not getting invite, nor her step-sister Samantha Markle.Samantha Markle (Picture: ITV)Meghan’s uncle has also criticised Meghan for ‘snubbing’ her family, while her niece has defended her and insisted the Markle family should keep out of Meghan’s business.Meghan Markle\u0027s family has been quite the topic of conversation since her wedding to Prince Harry was announced.The former Suits actress grew up in the US with orced parents and half brothers and sisters and her past - and this past has followed her since news broke in November 2016 that she was dating Harry.Some of Meghan\u0027s family members have been more vocal than others (in the interest of transparency, the main culprit is of course Samantha Markle, her loose-tongued half-sister), while others have kept a more respectful silence, namely her mother Doria Ragland and father Thomas Markle.When it was confirmed that the couple have sent out their wedding invites to around 800 guests, the question was - which of her family members have made the cut?Here, we take a look at which of Meghan\u0027s family members have been invited to the royal wedding...Meghan\u0027s mother Doria is a definite on the invite list and she\u0027ll no doubt be flying over from the US in time for Meghan\u0027s second hen party.It has even been rumoured that Meghan could break with convention and have both her father and her mother, Doria, walk her down the aisle on 19 May.Doria, 61, met Harry at last year’s Invictus Games in Toronto and the Prince previously described her as ‘amazing’.Tom and Doria, a social worker, orced when Meghan was six but she is said to \u0027adore\u0027 both her parents.It was revealed last week that Thomas Markle - who reportedly lives a reclusive life in Mexico - is also on the invite list.The paper reported a \u0027close confidante\u0027 of the 73-year-old Hollywood lighting director - who has yet to meet the prince - will be flying in for the ceremony from his quiet retirement village to share the special day with his daughter.\u0027All the pressure has been hard on him and he’s just trying to stay out of the limelight.’\u0027Tom has said from the start that he wants to walk her down the aisle, and that has never changed,\u0027 the source added.It\u0027s understood Samantha Grant - although she calls herself Samantha Markle on her Twitter page - has not been invited to Meghan and Harry\u0027s wedding.Last month she took to Twitter and claimed none of the Markle family had been invited.Since Meghan\u0027s relationship with Prince Harry was revealed, Samantha has taken it upon herself to make damning comments and criticism of Meghan to the press.However, while she might have received the right royal snub, she will still be in Windsor for the wedding weekend as a guest of a TV channel.It\u0027s also thought Meghan\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr. - the son of her father Thomas and her step-mother Roslyn and brother of Samantha Grant - has not received an invite in the post.Thomas Jr. has filed for bankruptcy in the past, has been orced twice and faced trial on gun charges before the case was dropped.The father-of-two lives in Grants Pass, Oregon, and works as a window fitter.While it\u0027s understood he does not keep in contact with Meghan, he has shared family photos of her to the press. He also allegedly posted her a letter apologising for any upset he has caused her.But, according to reports, the so-called letter didn\u0027t stop Meghan leaving him off the wedding guest list.Meghan\u0027s former sister-in-law Tracey Dooley appeared on Good Morning Britain in which she spoke about not receiving an invite to the royal wedding.When asked if Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas, will walk Meghan down the aisle, Tracey shared: \u0027I\u0027ve heard that he\u0027s going to be over there and I\u0027m sure that he will be giving her away.\u0027The arrangements are being made...I don\u0027t think he\u0027s waiting for his invitation, because I\u0027m sure they already have the plans in place, and for me talking to him, he\u0027s very excited to be a part of it.\u0027Likewise, Meghan\u0027s nephew who she used to babysit - Tyler Dooley, the son of Thomas Markle Jr. and Tracey Dooley - has not received an invite to Harry and Meghan\u0027s nuptials.However, Tyler and his mum Tracey will be in the UK in May anyway to help with Good Morning Britain\u0027s coverage of the royal wedding, which is costing an estimated £32million.Sorry, this video is no longer available.Thomas Markle\u0027s brothers Michael and Fred are not invited to Harry and Meghan\u0027s big day either.Michael spoke out last month about being snubbed from the invite list.It\u0027s also understood Joseph Johnson, her uncle on her mother\u0027s side of the family, has not received an invite to the royal wedding.What royal title Meghan Markle will have has been a topic of debate ever since Prince Harry confirmed their engagement in November last year.Will she be Princess Meghan? What about Duchess Meghan like Kate Middleton? How about Lady Meghan?One thing\u0027s for sure: when Meghan - whose full name is Rachel Meghan Markle - marries Prince Harry, she will no longer simply be known as \u0027Meghan Markle\u0027.While the Royal Family are yet to confirm whether Harry will become a Duke upon marriage, historians have speculated what her name will change to when she marries Prince Harry on 19 May this year.If Harry retains his current rank - His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales - it\u0027s believed Meghan will take on the feminine version of his title, becoming known as Her Royal Highness Princess Henry of Wales.But if Harry becomes a Duke upon marriage, as he is widely expected to, Meghan will therefore become a Duchess, just like Kate Middleton became Catherine, Duchess Of Cambridge upon marriage to Prince William, Duke Of Cambridge.Royal Historian Marlene Koenig wrote on the blog Royal Musings that Meghan is most likely to become the Meghan, Duchess Of Sussex if, as it is widely believed, Harry takes the vacant rank of Duke Of Sussex.\u0027Meghan would be HRH the Duchess of Sussex,\u0027 Joenig has previously told Royal Contral. \u0027Her rank would be a princess by marriage of the United Kingdom, Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\u0027This view is actually shared by a number of experts who previously predicted the title, that has sat vacant since 1843, would be given to Prince William before he became the Duke of Cambridge.Other titles available are Clarence and Buckingham.Catherine, Duchess Of Cambridge - who was just known as Kate Middleton before she married Prince William, Duke Of Cambridge in April 2011 - could also go by the name of HRH Princess William of Wales if she wished.So why won\u0027t Meghan be given a Princess title?While she will become a princess by marriage, for someone to assume the title of Princess, they must be born into the Royal Family, just like Princess Charlotte is a Princess because of her father\u0027s status.However, if Harry and Meghan were to have children, they would not automatically be called Prince or Princess as there\u0027s another layer to the Princess rule.Meghan and Harry\u0027s children would be given the title of Lord or Lady, taking the surname Mountbatten-Windsor - a nod to Prince Philip\u0027s family name.In 1960, the Queen passed a ruling which only entitled the children or the grandchildren of the sovereign to take the title of Prince or Princess.However, for the grandchildren to take the titles, they must be born to the sovereign\u0027s son - not daughter.In the case of Zara and Peter Phillips, for example, they are the children of Princess Anne. Anne is the Queen’s daughter and as the children of the monarch’s daughter, they do not hold a royal title.All of their cousins are children of the monarch’s sons – Charles, Edward and Andrew – so their children do get the royal titles, such as Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess Of York\u0027s children Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.However, in the case of Prince Edward, his and Sophie, Countess Of Wessex\u0027s children are not Prince or Princess.Instead, their daughter Louise, 14, is known as Lady Louise Windsor and their son James, 10, is known as James Viscount Severn.With Edward being given the Earl Of Wessex title upon marriage, he and Sophie decided to give their children the titles usually given to Earls\u0027 children to somewhat shield them from the royal spotlight.When Louise and James are older there is no law that would stop them from taking up the Prince and Princess titles, if they wish.So why are Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis allowed to carry the coveted titles?A 1917 ruling stated that HRH titles were limited to the Monarch, the Monarch\u0027s children and grandchildren and the Monarch\u0027s eldest-born\u0027s first grandson.That would mean that only Prince George could have legally been called a Prince, while Charlotte and Louis would be Lady Charlotte Mountbatten-Windsor and Lord Louis Mountbatten-Windsor.However, in 2012 - one year after Kate and William married - the Queen allowed all children of William and Kate - her great-grandchildren - to take the Prince or Princess titles too.The ruling does mean, however, that Princess Charlotte\u0027s children are unlikely to be called Prince or Princess, just like Princess Anne\u0027s children were not.Harry and Meghan\u0027s prospective children could be upgraded to Prince or Princesses when the line of succession to the throne changes as Prince Charles ascends the throne.Prince Harry would then likely become HRH The Prince Henry, meaning Meghan would become HRH The Princess Henry.Of course the Queen may also choose to make an exception for Harry\u0027s children, like she did for William.MORE: The upcoming royal wedding has had a hand in the most popular baby names for springMORE: Who is designing Meghan Markle’s wedding dress – from Ralph \u0026amp Russo to Alexander McQueen"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_10343842.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"mums mirror selfie goes hilariously wrong thanks photobombing toddler","story":"(Picture: Georgia Shorthall)If you say you’ve never had a selfie go wrong, you’re lying.Unflattering angles.

Check it out. American traditions that may be included in the Royal weddingA large bouquetTraditionally, Royal wedding bouquets are smaller and more subdued. American brides tend to have more over-the-top, eye-catching floral arrangements in hand on their wedding day and there\u0027s a good chance Meghan Markle might go that route.   Kensington Palace confirmed on Twitter that the wedding flowers will include \u0027flowers and plants that are in season and blooming naturally in May\u0027.          Princess Diana omitted the word \u0027obey\u0027 from her vows at her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. Kate Middleton followed in her footsteps in 2011 and Meghan will likely do the sameAccording to ABC News, the vows have been modernized, however.In 2000, they were changed to: \u0027I, (bridebroom name), take you, (groombride name) to be my wifehusband, to have and to hold from this day forward for better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish, till death us do part.\u0027Princess Diana omitted the word \u0027obey\u0027 from her vows at her wedding to Prince Charles in 1981. Kate Middleton followed in her footsteps in 2011 and Meghan will likely do the same. Adult bridesmaidsTraditionally, bridesmaids at Royal weddings are children. The maid of honor and best man are the only adult members of the wedding party.While Princess Charlotte and other young members of the Royal family will likely be included, Meghan is expected to invite friends of hers to be bridesmaids as well. This is a tradition among American brides.Kate Middleton will probably not be one of those adult bridesmaids, according to the Daily Express.       How to change your Twitter passwordWho are Sam and Mark?

The pupils who changed returned to lessons. All the pupils in detention were provided with work and given ample opportunity to use the time constructively to prepare for their forthcoming examinations. The school deems this to have been a proportionate response and the matter is now closed.\u0027"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/09/4BCBDD7A00000578-0-image-a-9_1525336785439.jpg","title":"Woman doesnt believe autistic girl 4 disabled Bishops Stortford car park","story":"    Hannah Blatch is pictured with her son Max, 2, and daughter Lily, 4, who has a long list of physical and mental health issues Writing on Facebook she penned an open letter to the woman who accused her of \u0027not being disabled\u0027 describing little Lily as \u0027the kindest, most gentle, endearing little girl\u0027. Describing what happened that day, Ms Blatch said: \u0027We had just come back from town and I was loading up Lily\u0027s pushchair into the car when I noticed a woman at the ticket machine watching me.\u0027I didn\u0027t think much of it at first but as she walked passed she said to her husband \u0027well she\u0027s clearly not disabled\u0027.\u0027I looked straight at her and said \u0027well actually my daughter is, but thank you for your concern\u0027 and then she actually said \u0027well she doesn\u0027t look disabled\u0027.\u0027Her husband, bless him, looked like he could have died a thousand deaths.\u0027Autistic boy, six, is banned from special needs school bus...\u0027I never meant to annoy anyone, I was only trying to enjoy...Share this articleLily, of Takeley, Essex who turns five in July, only started speaking nine months ago and has to attend around ten medical appointments a month for a number of health conditions.The youngster has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, postural tachycardia syndrome - a heart condition - and severe OCD, as well as autism. She suffers from a range of symptoms including seizures, blackouts, social anxiety and swelling of her joints.She also has a gastrointestinal condition which means she still has to wear nappies.But her mother says she looks like a \u0027typical four-year-old\u0027 most of the time, which has often led to them being on the receiving end of \u0027judgmental\u0027 looks and comments when out in public, as well as confrontations over parking.She added: \u0027I\u0027ve had it happen regularly, and it\u0027s always in Stortford.

King Edward VII is pictured with Queen Alexandra at York Cottage in 1899           Prince Henry of Wales, the Duke of Gloucester is pictured at York Cottage in September 1902George, like Harry, was the second son, not expecting to inherit the throne. But then his older brother Prince Eddy, Duke of Clarence, died suddenly aged 28.It was on his marriage that George was given what was then called the Bachelors\u0027 Cottage — built as an overspill for Sandringham\u0027s unmarried shooting guests. A man of simple tastes, he wanted nothing grander. The house had been designed by a Colonel Edis, an old friend of Edward VII, but according to biographer James Pope-Hennessy: \u0027The main drawback was that he was not an architect at all.\u0027From Edis\u0027s sketch-pad came a maze of twisting passages, narrow stairs and bedrooms the size of a housemaid\u0027s cupboard.The nursery could barely contain a small rocking-horse.

Even when he was king after his father died, George remained there while his widowed mother Queen Alexandra stayed in the big house at Sandringham.To accommodate George V and his growing family, York Cottage was extended twice — making it \u0027even odder\u0027 according to Pope-Hennessy.           Prince Albert is pictured in 1864 Queen Mary thought it was ugly, and hated it for every one of the 33 years she was forced to live there. So too did the royal children —among them our present Queen\u0027s father, George VI, and another Prince Harry — the future Duke of Gloucester.They couldn\u0027t wait to get away, but none the less were forced to spend six months of every year at York Cottage during their growing up years.There was no privacy — the place was overrun. George and Mary and their six children came first, but then there were equerries, ladies-in-waiting, private secretaries, four pages, a chef, valet, footmen, wine butlers, nurses, nursemaids, housemaids and cooks.There was nowhere for staff to sleep — \u0027the King said he supposed they roosted in the trees,\u0027 wrote biographer Kenneth Rose.And his majesty\u0027s private secretary — effectively the CEO of House of Windsor — had to use his tiny bedroom as his office, with his visitors perching on a chair in the corridor until he could greet them.No wonder, then, that with such lack of space each Christmas turned into \u0027a feast of acrimony\u0027. \u0027An atmosphere of restriction, killjoy pompousness, mystery, artificiality, and the most complete and utter boredom,\u0027 wrote David, later Edward VIII.          Inside the drawing room at York Cottage at Sandringham pictured in October 1897 \u0027And that doesn\u0027t even begin to describe how ghastly it is.\u0027There was worse. York Cottage was pervaded by the ghost of King George\u0027s elder brother Prince Eddy, who\u0027d borne the title Duke of Clarence and was expected to inherit the throne until his early death.Even today\u0027s most ardent royalists agree Prince Eddy was the worst king we never had.Recklessly promiscuous in his sex life, he suffered constantly from gonorrhea and was utterly brainless.In the army, he could not be guaranteed to turn the right way on the parade ground and forgot the orders he was supposed to issue to his men.He was embroiled in the Cleveland Street scandal, where telegraph clerks from the General Post Office were used as rent-boys in London by the titled and rich — and was urgently dispatched on a tour of India when the ringleaders were put on trial at the Old Bailey.          York Cottage at Sandringham in Norfolk is pictured from behind with its private lake But he liked women too, with his fellow officers encouraging him to try new experiences in order to ingratiate themselves.He was even suspected, then finally cleared, of being Jack The Ripper.Eddy was said to have secretly married at the age of 20 to an artist\u0027s model called Annie Crook, and later he was ensnared for his sexual high-jinks by a notorious blackmailer, Maude Richardson.He was named as the lover of a chorus girl, Lydia Miller, who committed suicide by swallowing carbolic acid.He was nothing short of a walking disaster for the Royal Family.There was a concerted effort to get Eddy married off, in the hope it would put an end to his wild ways, but finding a suitable bride proved impossible — his reputation as a brainless philanderer went before him.          Harry and Meghan are pictured attending a reception for the Commonwealth Youth Forum in London In the end Princess May of Teck, a distant cousin, agreed to the job — but just at that moment Eddy, weakened by gonorrhea, died of influenza.Weirdly, within weeks, May accepted the proposal of marriage from Eddy\u0027s younger brother George, and so became Queen Mary. Both she, and her husband,lived intimately with Eddy\u0027s ghost at Sandringham.\u0027All is left just as it was,\u0027 wrote Empress Frederick of Prussia, their cousin.\u0027His dressing-table with his watch, his brushes and combs and everything. His bed covered with a Union Jack in silk, and his photos and clothes in a glass cupboard.\u0027George\u0027s children grew up with this ghost, and couldn\u0027t wait to get away.Bertie — the present Queen\u0027s father — was on the lookout for a bride from his teens on, the only means of escape being marriage and a home of his own.His sister Princess Mary, equally desperate, accepted the hand of the Earl of Harewood, who at 40 was 16 years her senior (Harewood\u0027s reputedly proposed to her for a wager).The future Edward VIII, according to his biographer Philip Ziegler, hated York Cottage — \u0027as he grew older it came more and more to symbolise all that he disliked about family life\u0027.So nobody enjoyed the redbrick, suburban, glum and gloomy house — apart from King George. \u0027Very nice to be in this dear wee house again,\u0027 he wrote unknowingly in his diary.But no royal ever lived in it again. In 1925 he and Queen Mary moved up to the big house after the death of his mother Queen Alexandra, and the place was eventually turned into what it is today — staff offices, with a few flats tacked on.York Cottage\u0027s convenience for Meghan and Harry is that it\u0027s near to William and Kate at Anmer Hall, and should babies come along, their cousins will provide handy playmates.But a joyful place for their future family home?As Meghan has yet to learn, there are a few heavy prices you have to pay when you become a princess."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/10/4BD80ABD00000578-0-image-m-8_1525425832384.jpg","title":"Theresa braces devastating losses counting begins local elections","story":"Local election voter ID check - LIVE: People denied right to vote in UK for first time ever due to lack of identification | The IndependentElectoral Commission | How to vote"},{"url":null,"title":"Starbucks new Frappuccinos alarming calorie count","story":"How to change your Twitter passwordWho are Sam and Mark?

The fund will pay their wages.As part of his offering, he will also announce proposals to drop an accountability measure that names and shames ‘coasting’ schools. It has been hated by teachers since it was introduced three years ago as the Government had originally said those identified would be forced to become academies.The new sabbaticals for teachers will act as a reward for those with ten or more years of experience and will enable them to work on projects that complement their work in the classroom. Participants will be expected to show how their work will benefit their pupils when they return to school.It follows warnings about a teacher shortage caused by rising pupil numbers and an improving private sector job market. Announcing the move today in a speech to the annual conference of the National Association of Head Teachers, Mr Hinds will say he is keen to attract more talented people to the profession.‘All of us have a shared goal of making sure teaching remains an attractive, fulfilling profession,’ he will say.Essex teacher who kicked a female pupil and branded her...The pupils who can\u0027t talk properly: Education secretary vows...British schools linked to an Abu Hamza \u0027terror academy\u0027 are...Ex-integration tsar warns a £50million plan to end ided...Share this article‘We will take an unflinching look at the things that discourage people from going into teaching or make them consider leaving … and we will also look at how we support teachers to get better at what they do and hone their experience and career progression.’While there are currently a record number of teachers working in schools, the increase in staff has not kept pace with the explosion of the pupil population following a period of sustained migration.The measures proposed by Mr Hinds are aimed at encouraging more people into the profession to plug the shortfall. Other offerings include introducing ‘flexible working practices’ and extending on-the-job training for new teachers.And in an olive branch to the profession, the Education Secretary will also say he intends to drop the ‘coasting schools’ accountability measure.Currently, school exam results are judged on two measures – a minimum ‘below the floor’ standard and a ‘coasting’ standard aimed at exposing those schools that are not performing as well as expected even if they meet minimum requirements.          The move intends to stop burn out and help teachers advance in their careersTeachers branded the measure complicated and unfair. Mr Hinds will now revert to one minimum standard, with a consultation on how that should be set, and no threat of the measure being used to force schools to become academies.Only schools deemed failing by Ofsted will now be in line for conversion into academies.Stressing the need for accountability, Mr Hinds will say today: ‘I intend to replace the current confusing system of having both “below the floor” and “coasting” standards for performance.‘I have a clear message to schools and their leaders: I trust you to get on with the job.’Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, welcomed the proposals. ‘Teaching is such a rewarding profession, so it’s disheartening to see teachers leaving due to the pressure of workload and high stakes accountability. A fund for sabbaticals is exactly what we’re asking for.‘Removing the coasting and floor standards will do much to address the confusion felt by many school leaders.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/03/16/05B1A790000003E8-5687617-image-a-25_1525361189569.jpg","title":"Sajid Javid Afghan interpreters allowed stay UK without fees","story":"    In his first newspaper article as Home Secretary, Sajid Javid (pictured) has announced he will guarantee Afghan interpreters who served in Helmand Province will be able to stay in the UKThe commitment and bravery shown by our local interpreters while our Armed Forces were in Afghanistan was extraordinary. As the Mail has highlighted, they worked in dangerous and challenging situations, regularly putting their lives at risk.Put simply, we would not have been able to carry out our work there without them.It was in recognition of this unique and exceptional service to the UK that we made the offer of relocating these iniduals and their families.Around 400 people have already taken up the offer and have relocated with their families, meaning in total around 1,100 people are now living in the UK.For almost five years they have been building their lives here, contributing to local communities, and we cannot allow those who have been through so much to have their lives disrupted again. I know some have felt uncertainty about their future – an issue I\u0027ve been following for some time.As I said when I stood at the despatch box on my first day in this job, I want to ensure that we have an immigration system that is fair and humane. That\u0027s why today – as one of my first acts as Home Secretary – I am announcing that I will be bringing forward new immigration rules which will ensure that the Afghan interpreters who have been making this country their home will have a route to permanent settlement. And I am also waiving the fees so they won\u0027t have to pay a penny for it.

Everyone was given the opportunity to bring family members over with them when they came to the UK.But I know that some people still have family members in Afghanistan.

I call upon the international community to condemn the grave anti-Semitism of Abu Mazen (Abbas), which should have long since passed from this world.\u0027 He added: \u0027Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, gave another anti-Semitic speech. With utmost ignorance and brazen gall, he claimed that European Jews were persecuted and murdered not because they were Jews but because they gave loans with interest.\u0027 David Friedman, the US ambassador to Israel, said Abbas had reached a \u0027new low\u0027 while President Donald Trump\u0027s envoy Jason Greenblatt said \u0027peace cannot be built on this kind of foundation.\u0027Tensions between Israel and Iran show us that once again the...Share this articleThe comments came after Abbas, who has faced accusations of anti-Semitism before, suggested in an address to a rare meeting of the Palestinian National Council on Monday night that Jews\u0027 relations with banking had led to hostility against them.\u0027From the 11th century until the Holocaust that took place in Germany, those Jews - who moved to Western and Eastern Europe - were subjected to a massacre every 10 to 15 years. But why did this happen? They say \u0027it is because we are Jews\u0027,\u0027 he told the hundreds of delegates.He then cited \u0027three books\u0027 written by Jews as evidence that \u0027hostility against Jews is not because of their religion, but rather their social function,\u0027 adding he meant \u0027their social function related to banks and interest.\u0027He contrasted this with Jews in Arabic countries, who he argued had not faced similar persecution.Friedman said on Twitter late on Tuesday Abbas had \u0027reached a new low in attributing the cause of massacres of Jewish people over the years to their \u0027social behaviour relating to interest and banks.\u0027\u0027  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the Palestinian president of anti-Semitism after Mahmud Abbas suggested Jews were to blame for the Holocaust\u0027To all those who think Israel is the reason that we don\u0027t have peace, think again,\u0027 he added.Greenblatt said the comments were \u0027very unfortunate, very distressing \u0026amp terribly disheartening,\u0027 calling for them to be \u0027unconditionally condemned by all.\u0027Israeli foreign ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told AFP Abbas\u0027s \u0027anti-Semitism\u0027 was \u0027all the more shocking considering that he presents himself as wanting to make peace with Israel.\u0027 The European Union condemned Abbas for \u0027unacceptable remarks\u0027. \u0027The speech Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas delivered on 30 April contained unacceptable remarks concerning the origins of the Holocaust and Israel\u0027s legitimacy,\u0027 a spokesman for the EU\u0027s diplomatic service said in a statement.\u0027Such rhetoric will only play into the hands of those who do not want a two-state solution, which President Abbas has repeatedly advocated.\u0027 The row comes as relations between the US and the Palestinian leadership have broken down over the controversial American plan to move its Israeli embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The move, which is due to be completed on May 14, sparked major protests by Palestinians, who consider east Jerusalem their capital, and led Abbas to cut off ties with Trump\u0027s administration. "},{"url":null,"title":"How change Twitter password","story":"How to change your Twitter passwordWho are Sam and Mark?

Guests will be arriving at the Round Tower by coach and will be seen walking to the South Door of St George\u0027s Chapel.Members of The Royal Family will begin to arrive from 11.20am, and enter St George\u0027s Chapel via the Galilee Porch.

message that visitors to Windsor will have a chance to be part of a very special day, but those who will be heading to the town really do need to plan their journeys carefully.\u0027The Royal Borough

November, Prince Harry and Ms Markle have been incredibly grateful for the support they have received from members of the public.\u0027The crowds that have turned out in Nottingham, Cardiff, Brixton, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Bath and elsewhere have given Ms Markle a welcome to the United Kingdom marked by warmth, enthusiasm, and a real sense of fun.\u0027We said from the outset that Prince Harry and Ms Markle were keen to make sure that members of the public would have the opportunity to feel part of the celebrations on their wedding day.\u0027This is their way of expressing their gratitude for the messages of support they have received from around the UK, the Commonwealth, Ms Markle\u0027s home country of the United States, and right around the world.\u0027As we said back in November, this wedding will be guided by tradition, allowing everyone to celebrate what makes Royal Weddings so special, but also one which reflects the personalities of Prince Harry and Ms Markle.

will take guidance on whether Prince Philip should attend the royal wedding closer to the eventBuckingham Palace is hopeful Prince Philip will be at the royal wedding although his attendance is not guaranteed, it emerged today.The Duke of Edinburgh is currently recuperating from a hip replacement and may have to be aided with a \u0027stylish stick or cane\u0027 at the ceremony. Asked whether  Philip would be at the wedding, a palace aide said today: \u0027We very much hope so.\u0027 Royal staff will take guidance on whether he is well enough to attend closer to the time, the member of staff added.The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the private King Edward VII Hospital in early April for surgery after a month of severe discomfort on the advice of doctors.It seems as if the 96-year-old, who is likely to still be using walking sticks or crutches at this stage, was keen not to be seen incapacitated so left ten days later after a prolonged rest.Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor Castle, where the Queen is in residence, and both the Queen and Princess Anne have said he is in \u0027good form\u0027.The elderly royal will have already begun his rehabilitation moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of physiotherapy as he learns to walk again on his new hip.The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure when aged 95 then later an emergency operation when 97 following a fall.For about a month before his operation the duke had complained about trouble with the joint but medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.   Meghan will NOT have a maid of honour... but

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/13/4BD8384C00000578-5691227-image-a-12_1525436763195.jpg","title":"Whod want live Kray twins old cells","story":"    This prison which has hundreds of years of history will be turned into luxury flats Alongside restoring and converting the original listed prison buildings into 38 one, two and three-bedroom flats, seven new buildings will be built to house another 164 apartments.

Irresistible: Every year, Keith Fielder admires this gorgeous pink and white magnolia tree in Park Road, north west London           Pictured is Christopher Marsh\u0027s magnolia tree in Puttenham, Surrey against stunning blue skies and country backdrop Many species are tender and will not survive in any but the mildest British gardens. Others require a distinctly acidic soil in order to thrive. But two species with more adaptability have come to dominate our modern gardens and streets.The first to flower is Magnolia stellata, the star magnolia from Japan. This is perhaps the easiest to grow, adapting to most soils and situations, although happiest in sunshine. The other favourite is Magnolia x soulangeana.There are many names, clones and cultivars and all tolerate a degree of pollution — which is why they became so popular for roadside suburban developments in the 1920s and 30s.          Mail readers Jeremy and Ann Pemberton entered this picture of a bright pink magnolia tree in Richmond upon Thames           Brightening up the garden: Richard Blackburn\u0027s entry is pictured next to his house on a quiet suburban street In my garden, I grow M. x soulangeana \u0027Black Tulip\u0027 and although it\u0027s very hardy, most years the flowers get hit by late frost — although this late spring I am keeping my fingers crossed.But whatever magnolia you grow, each and every one is blessed with glorious flowers.Always position new plants in a sunny, protected site and keep them well watered. Pruning is largely unnecessary save to remove any damaged shoots or branches. With time and care, you never know, you, too, could one day have a magnificent magnolia like this in your garden.

message that visitors to Windsor will have a chance to be part of a very special day, but those who will be heading to the town really do need to plan their journeys carefully.\u0027The Royal Borough of Windsor has confirmed that preparations include:A 6,000 space pre-booked car parking area at the Review Ground, just off the Long WalkFood stalls and facilities, including big screens showing live

November, Prince Harry and Ms Markle have been incredibly grateful for the support they have received from members of the public.\u0027The crowds that have turned out in Nottingham, Cardiff, Brixton, Edinburgh, Birmingham, Belfast, Bath and elsewhere have given Ms Markle a welcome to the United Kingdom marked by warmth, enthusiasm, and a real sense of fun.\u0027We said from the outset that Prince Harry and Ms Markle were keen to make sure that members of the public would have the opportunity to feel part of the celebrations on their wedding day.\u0027This is their way of expressing their gratitude for the messages of support they have received from around the UK, the Commonwealth, Ms Markle\u0027s home country of the United States, and right around the world.\u0027As we said back in November, this wedding will be guided by tradition, allowing everyone to celebrate what makes Royal Weddings so special, but also one which reflects the personalities of Prince Harry and Ms Markle.

will take guidance on whether Prince Philip should attend the royal wedding closer to the eventBuckingham Palace is hopeful Prince Philip will be at the royal wedding although his attendance is not guaranteed, it emerged today.The Duke of Edinburgh is currently recuperating from a hip replacement and may have to be aided with a \u0027stylish stick or cane\u0027 at the ceremony. Asked whether  Philip would be at the wedding, a palace aide said today: \u0027We very much hope so.\u0027 Royal staff will take guidance on whether he is well enough to attend closer to the time, the member of staff added.The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to the private King Edward VII Hospital in early April for surgery after a month of severe discomfort on the advice of doctors.It seems as if the 96-year-old, who is likely to still be using walking sticks or crutches at this stage, was keen not to be seen incapacitated so left ten days later after a prolonged rest.Buckingham Palace said he would continue his recovery at Windsor Castle, where the Queen is in residence, and both the Queen and Princess Anne have said he is in \u0027good form\u0027.The elderly royal will have already begun his rehabilitation moving with the aid of a stick or crutches, and will face weeks of physiotherapy as he learns to walk again on his new hip.The Queen Mother underwent two successful hip replacement operations in the 1990s, first a planned procedure when aged 95 then later an emergency operation when 97 following a fall.For about a month before his operation the duke had complained about trouble with the joint but medical experts have said a few weeks after a hip replacement patients are usually back to their normal lifestyle, free from pain.   Meghan will NOT have a maid of honour... but

It has taken four generations of hard-working ancestors saving until there was enough money spare for my late father to put a deposit on a house.\u0027Mrs Gabriel, who also attended court, said that her son had been \u0027crucified\u0027 by the strain of the court battle.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/14/4BD93E6600000578-5691311-image-a-177_1525439424442.jpg","title":"Royal wedding George Charlotte expected page boys flower girls","story":"Put your princess in a pretty as a petal dress like Charlotte in Little Alice LondonClick to check it out!Prince George and Princess Charlotte were pictured making their way inside the Lindo Wing of St. Mary\u0026#39s hospital with dad William, ready to meet their new baby brother.Charlotte was her usual excitable self as she arrived at the hospital waving to the cameras and she looked adorable in a blue dress by Little Alice London.

Elderly New York society doyennes walked through the collection with private guides, stopping for a second to admire the Monets and Picassos, as tour groups crowded by the ornate porcelains and decorative arts, ning centuries and continents, craning their heads to catch a glimpse.But then, this is no ordinary collection, and it will certainly be no ordinary auction.Spread across three floors of Christie’s salerooms is the sprawling private collection of David Rockefeller, the billionaire banker and globetrotting philanthropist who died last year at 101. The last surviving grandchild of the oil magnate and America’s first billionaire John D Rockefeller, David Rockefeller spent much of his life collecting exceptional works of modern art, which will now be sold to raise money for the family’s preferred charitable causes.Branded as a once-in-a-generation chance for global collectors to buy some of the world’s most significant pieces still in private collection, some predict the auction, which will take place over three days next week, could be the first to raise $1bn in total.“This is not just a New York event,” said Jonathan Rendell, Christie’s deputy chairman. “It’s a world event. It is an exceptional sale.”Among the collection’s highlights include Picasso’s Fillette à la corbeille fleurie (Young Girl with a Basket of Flowers), one of the finest portraits of his rose period. The painting had hung in the living room of Rockefeller’s grand Manhattan home on the Upper East Side for decades. He bought it from the estate of Gertrude Stein in 1968, meaning the painting has only had two owners. It was described in Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast, the memoir of the author’s time in 1920s Paris, as hanging in Stein’s Left Bank apartment.The piece is expected to sell for over $100m.Also on sale is Monet’s Nymphéas en fleur (Water Lilies in Bloom), an important work in the artist’s series of water garden paintings. The work is distinguished by the fact that all the lilies are in full bloom, and was brought to New York after Rockefeller, with his wife Peggy, who died in 1996, purchased it from a dealer in Paris in 1956. The painting had hung at the couple’s Hudson Pines estate in Sleepy Hollow, near the bottom of grand, winding staircase, and is estimated to sell for between $50m and $70m.The collection also includes a number of works from American artists including Edward Hopper, Georgia O’Keeffe and Willem de Kooning – most of them valued at over seven figures. Diego Rivera’s masterwork The Rivals, painted in 1931 in a makeshift studio aboard the steamship that brought him and Frida Kahlo to New York, will also be on sale – valued at up to $7m.“Encountering the quality of these paintings has been a fantastic journey for all of us,” Rendell said. But even among these eye-watering estimates there is a sense that Christie’s has veered on the conservative side. Following the $450m sale of a painting by Leonardo Da Vinci at the end of last year, a price that shattered auction records, some predict the auction’s banner items will go for much higher than the estimated price.Rendell would not be drawn on the issue. “I will wait until next week and then I’ll say if it was a conservative estimate. This week, the estimate is what the estimate is,” he said.While the greatest monetary value lies in Rockefeller’s modern art, the collection extends to an array of extraordinary artefacts, from a dinner service Napoleon took with him into exile on the island of Elba in 1814, to a 13th-century Syrian incense burner unique in that it has Christian and Islamic decoration. The burner had sat on Rockefeller’s desk until his death.The Rockefellers purchased many of the pieces over their decades of collecting for relatively small prices, only to see the valuation balloon in recent years as the market surged.Nonetheless, in a bid to keep the sale as accessible as possible, hundreds of items, including costume jewellery and furniture, are being placed in an online auction where bidding starts as low as $100.To many in the art world, next week’s auction marks the end of an era. Rockefeller, who had long pledged to sell his entire collection and donate the proceeds to a group of chosen charities, was the last in a line of tycoon collectors whose primary mission was to patronise the arts through their purchases.“It was the stagecraft of his life,” said Evan Beard, national art services executive at US Trust, Bank of America’s private wealth management ision. “But the folks who will be buying a lot of this material will be a new breed of collector, where they have at least one eye on the financial component. Art for them is an extension of their financial life.”Beard said he represented a number of buyers planning to bid on some of the most lucrative items in the catalogue. A group of which were hedge fund managers, “trophy hunting clients”, aiming to put together some of the great private collections in the world.“Many of these folks think of themselves as the next generation. So you’ll see some bidding just because of the cultural capital that is contained within these works,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f442d892d5b8c4414edff4fe328a80559388188e/0_244_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=002444e5406adb030472fe8b6976dc46","title":"art shay acclaimed photographer in pictures","story":"Shay, who has died aged 96, photographed celebrities, politicians and ordinary Americans during a career that ned 70 years.

Other surveys paint a stronger picture and we still believe that the wage story will turn higher and be the catalyst for the Fed to take a more aggressive stance on the inflation threat...we continue to look for 3 further interest rates rises this year, starting with June 13.Revisions to the payroll number for February and March paint a slightly better picture overall:The 164,000 increase in US payrolls in April was well below the average monthly gain of 191,000 over the previous 12 months, the Labor Department said. In terms of sectors, there were job gains in professional and business services, manufacturing, health care, and mining over the month of April. There was little change in other major industries, including construction, retail, transport and warehousing, leisure and hospitality, and government.Breaking: The US economy added 164,000 jobs in April, weaker than the 192,000 forecast by economists.On the flip side, the number for March was revised up by the Labor Department, to 135,000 from an initial estimate of 103,000.Almost time for the US non farm payrolls report for April. Economists are predicting a rebound in job creation after a particularly weak March.Headline expectations according to a Reuters poll (March’s figures in brackets, which could be revised):Growth in eurozone retail sales slowed in March, according to figures published earlier by the statistics agency Eurostat.The US and Chinese delegations have reached agreement on some aspects of the trade row but there are still relatively big differences on other issues, according to China’s Xinhua news agency. Reuters reports:The two sides, though, committed to resolving their trade disputes through dialogue, state-run Xinhua reported.And the U.S. negotiators agreed to bring up with U.S. President Donald Trump the question of a ban on U.S. companies selling goods and software to Chinese telecommunication equipment maker ZTE Corp after representations from the Chinese side, the report said. ZTE faced the seven-year ban after the U.S. said it failed to keep to an agreement it made after breaching U.S. sanctions.The talks over the past two days have involved a high-level U.S. trade delegation led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and top Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Liu He, following months of threats and counter threats from both sides in a series of disputes over trade practices.The U.S. team has already left Beijing and is heading back to the U.S., a U.S. official told Reuters early on Friday evening. The Americans have yet to give their account of the talks.The trade discussions had been “candid, efficient and constructive,” Xinhua said, but gave almost no details on what the officials had agreed.The officials exchanged opinions on resolving tariffs and non-tariffs measures, on expanding two-way investment and the protection of intellectual property, and on expanding U.S. exports to China and bilateral services trade, Xinhua reported. It gave no indication of what actions might be taken based on those exchanges.“My impression was that (the talks) didn’t go well given the rhetoric,” said Kevin Lai, senior economist at Daiwa Capital markets in Hong Kong. “I think the ide is still very big.”Back with the trade talks, and Reuters is reporting some Chinese proposals to the US:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"harry meghan pay as you go wedding commoners royal wedding","story":"Oh, how the monarchy is modernising! Look at lovely, jokey Harry with his openness about mental health and his glowing fiancee, who astonishingly has had a life, is not a dumb blonde and says things about female independence. Oh, how they have moved on, this new generation of royals. They are just like us, after all.Except they are not. So the latest news about the commoners invited to the royal wedding is really stunning in its declaration of who’s who and what’s what. Kensington Palace (probably using the retch-inducing phrase “reach out”) announced earlier this year that Meghan and Harry were going “to allow members of the public to join in their celebration”. Very special people representing “youth” and “ersity” and – whisper it quietly – poor people would be allowed inside the perimeter of Windsor Castle. This is not just a wedding, remember, this is an attempt to build a bridge between high society and well … society.Twelve-hundred hand-picked “ordinary” people, many from charities that the royals support, will be let into the castle’s grounds. They will be there for hours and hours, and yet, it seems, they will not get so much as a vol-au-vent. Those who work with deprived and alienated people have been advised in letters from lord lieutenants “to bring a picnic lunch as it will not be possible to buy food and drink on site”. What? What kind of invite is that?It’s one that absolutely makes clear what is happening. That’s what. It never had anything to do with altruism. These ordinary people will effectively be extras for the TV coverage. They’ll make up a crowd that will be beamed around the world. The royals’ net wealth is estimated at around £400m – but now let us bow down before our rulers and hope that a garage sandwich will tide us over. Oh, I know it is not a good time to be a republican but quite honestly it never is. No one can begrudge the Queen, no one can’t admire the loveliness of Meghan, and on it goes. Only that kind of thinking is how this fountainhead of inequality is always made palatable.I once refused to go to a wedding because there was a pay bar as well as one of those irritating wedding lists. So I am not a great one for a pay-as-you-go celebrations. I can’t see it as anything other than meanness. Have a party or don’t. These occasions are actually very boring for spectators: hours of waiting around for a fleeting glimpse of a gloved hand as it speeds past. I was in the cathedral for Diana’s funeral, and on the way there we went past the crowds who had been sleeping in the street overnight. Weirdly, I was at Windsor for Harry’s father’s “low-key” wedding to Camilla, hoping, I suppose, for the ghost of Diana to appear. The crowds were quite sparse but had their flags to wave. What makes people wait for hours to do this, I remember asking a bored policeman. “We call them cat-stranglers,” he said. I didn’t know what that meant. “Women so mad they strangle their own cats,” he informed me.Now, though, the royalist media will go into overdrive and there will be a lot of reverential dross about protocol and etiquette. Debrett’s advises at least six canapes per guest before a wedding lunch. Harry and Meghan’s 600 actual guests will get the works, but the people chosen because they serve the most vulnerable in their communities will be left milling about for hours and are now Googling Windsor for the nearest supermarkets.As a metaphor for inclusivity royal-style, though, it’s all perfect, isn’t it? Do please come and gawp and cheer, but bring your own sandwiches. The meanness of the super-rich is truly something to behold. Twenty-one-year-old Saeed Atcha told the  that the news made him wonder if he should go to a nearby McDonald’s, but he wasn’t sure whether he’d be allowed to bring in a filet meal. He set up a magazine in Bolton after the 2011 riots and talked of the bemusement of some of the disadvantaged people his charity helps that the royals will scarcely offer invitees a drink. “It’s unfathomable,” he said. Not really, it’s the monarchy. Same as it ever was."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4813d7aa3bf50800a796ed01e08dc595bd406708/0_88_2464_1478/master/2464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a1601f242c61dc267fcee0ff29d20a7","title":"brexit britain political pendulum local elections","story":"The normal rules of governments being given bloody noses at local elections have been suspended• Key conclusions from a hazy night in English local electionsThe pendulum is stuck. The traditional laws of political gravity predict a swing away from the party of national government in local elections, but it has been a while since British politics followed the obvious arc of precedent.If last night’s council election results conform to any pattern, it is the laudable habit that voters have acquired of giving party leaders cause to scratch their heads and wonder what the hell is going on. There is no big national winner. Since the Tories were braced for a mauling and escaped without one, Theresa May will be feeling relatively relaxed today. Labour needed to demonstrate that last year’s general election gains were a staging post on the road to national power that destiny was calling Jeremy Corbyn. Destiny didn’t hang up the phone, but it has put the opposition on hold. Labour had ambitious targets – Tory bastions in London such as Westminster and Wandsworth – that did not fall.Outside the capital, Swindon and Nuneaton are the sort of places that would be swept up in Corbyn’s electoral slipstream if he were surging irresistibly towards Downing Street. But they resisted.Labour still gained a bunch of seats. The defence of the opposition’s performance is that expectations of a Corbynite carnival in Tory heartlands had run out of control, partly because of the exuberance of the party’s activists and partly because many Westminster observers were over-correcting for their failure to anticipate the Conservatives’ dismal showing last June.Not all of yesterday’s votes have been counted yet, but a provisional projection suggests that equivalent results, extrapolated as general election performances, would produce a House of Commons much like the current one. Parliament would still be hung. The biggest winners would be the Liberal Democrats, who would gain enough seats to make it back into the double-digit league.That gives Vince Cable’s party their first taste of good news since they won the Richmond Park byelection in 2016. That was celebrated as “remainers’ revenge” against the Tories in an affluent, metropolitan suburb. The Tories took the seat back within a year. Now Richmond council has turned decisively Lib Dem. Brexit is certain to be a factor there, as it is in the wider national picture. At the very least, the fact of Britain loitering in the EU departure lounge has an obvious causal relationship with the collapse of Ukip, whose number one grievance has been bitten off and digested into the political mainstream. The party didn’t even field candidates in many seats it won the last time these councils were in play. The Tories appear to have benefited most from those vacancies.Council ballots are often expressions of hyper-local issues, but the national context can’t be ignored. The government is attempting to pull off a vast, complex manoeuvre to reorient the entire country. Yet it still isn’t clear on what axis we are turning. The referendum battle was a messy combination of economic argument and culture war, neither of which has yet been settled. That is hardly surprising since Britain is still in an awkward limbo between the decision to leave (easily said) and safe exit (not so easily done). There is consensus between the two main English parties that Brexit is something that must be done, yet no agreement anywhere in the land on what that practically requires.It isn’t even possible to get a cabinet subcommittee to agree on a choice between two fractionally dissimilar variants of an alternative to the customs union. And that is just one part of the enormous apparatus of EU membership yet to be dismantled (and, in all likelihood, reassembled to roughly the same specifications). None of the big questions raised by Brexit – about the UK’s role in the world, its economic security, whether or not it is in cultural retreat from tolerance to outsiders – has an answer.The contours of those debates don’t map neatly on to the borough boundaries over which Labour and Tory troops did battle in rigid tribal formation. So even if Brexit wasn’t uppermost in many voters’ minds, it sat like a blustery, unsettled weather front over the whole political field, its unpredictable currents blowing gusts in multiple directions, helping some candidates and hindering others, but with no simple tailwind behind the biggest opposition party. The conditions were not conducive to easy swings of a pendulum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa80fd3ac31e42fefdd088dff2d3e0db524d76bd/812_262_4652_2792/master/4652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21ea46f5253bfcd4242f4069d91772bd","title":"lack trust government business corruption christine lagarde imf","story":"There are many reasons behind this heightened sense of dissatisfaction – the long tail of the global financial crisis, a perception that economic rewards are not being shared fairly, and growing anxiety about future job prospects. But when I talk to young people all over the world, one theme comes up repeatedly: corruption – the abuse of public office for private gain. I am convinced that corruption both feeds on and is fed by the broader crisis of trust, which sustains a vicious cycle that undermines economic health and social cohesion.By siphoning off precious reserves of trust, corruption makes it harder for society to take the collective decisions needed to advance the common good.The economic and social costs of corruption are clear. Consider, for example, the effects of corruption on the public accounts. It robs the tax system not only of revenues but of its very legitimacy. Corruption can also shift government spending away from valuable areas in health, education, and social protection, toward wasteful projects that enhance neither productive capacity nor human wellbeing.Given all this, it is not surprising that new research by the IMF found that corruption does serious damage to economic growth, investment, FDI, and tax revenues – and to income distribution and inclusive growth too.In light of this, the IMF is stepping up its engagement in the corruption and governance arena. This is only right – the mandate of the IMF, after all, is to secure financial stability and sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and our ability to pursue this mandate is jeopardised by deep-seated corruption.From this point on, we will be enhancing our analysis by making it deeper, longer, broader.Starting with deeper: the cancer of corruption cannot be cured by criminal enforcement alone. That is not the job of the IMF, anyway. In my experience the best tonic for depleted trust is heightened transparency. The best way to fight corruption is to put in place robust, accountable and transparent institutions. Accordingly, the IMF will look not only at corruption itself, but at the cracks in the various institutional frameworks that might let corruption creep in. Especially important here is transparency over government budgets, so that nothing is hidden from view or obscured. It is also important to keep regulations clear and simple, to reduce opportunities for corruption and cronyism.The International Monetary Fund, created in 1945, is an organisation of 189 countries based in Washington DC. It is governed by, and accountable, to member countries.Its goals are to ensure the stability of the international monetary system (exchange rates and international payments), to secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty.\u0026nbspThe IMF has bailed out scores of countries over the years, including the UK in 1976 when the minority Labour government borrowed £2.3bn from the fund to stabilise the value of the pound Iceland in 2008 and Greece in 2010, 2012 and 2015.​The number of bailouts of African countries has also increased in recent years as states became more vulnerable to commodity price crashes.The IMF was conceived at a UN conference in Bretton Woods in the US in July 1944 to build a framework for economic cooperation to avoid the devaluations that contributed to the Great Depression of the 1930s.​Most funds for IMF loans are provided by members via payments based on their position in the world economy, although the IMF can also borrow. Its decision-making also reflects members\u0027 relative influence.\u0026nbsp The Fund, as it is known, is one of the world’s biggest holders of gold.In terms of the “longer” focus, there may be countries where corruption has long been entrenched, with little harm to the economy surfacing today. But corruption hurts the economy through the slow atrophy of institutional trust.The broader focus suggests that where bribery is concerned, it takes two to tango. If a corrupt official is taking a bribe, somebody else is giving a bribe, and somebody else again is often helping to stash away the proceeds. It is wrong, both morally and economically, to pin the blame solely on officials in recipient countries. The net also needs to capture foreign investors, large corporations, and financial institutions that supply and conceal the payments.In today’s world, where funds can move quickly with little oversight, corruption is a global problem warranting a global response. For this reason, the IMF is asking countries with large financial and foreign investment sectors to volunteer for a check-up to see whether they criminalise and prosecute foreign bribery and have mechanisms to stop the laundering and concealment of dirty money.Restoring trust will not be quick or easy. But an important first step must be to build a strong foundation of governance and tackle corruption head-on. Otherwise, we will not be able to make progress on the pressing economic challenges of our times – including jobs and productivity growth, inequality and opportunity, and climate change.• Christine Lagarde is the managing director of the IMF"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c6490807d1b67dd7f2e2e224595af715426bf060/0_43_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62cb214a199173616001a39ba00cb5de","title":"momentum campaigning votes labour tories","story":"But Labour have real problems to address. Barnet was lost because many Jewish voters – as well as their friends and neighbours – fear the antisemitic fringe on the left. Labour has failed to properly address and defeat this fringe, and a wider culture of denial and complacency exists on the left. Antisemites have to be driven out of Labour, every single one. Labour’s new general secretary, Jennie Formby, has made this a priority: the full implementation of Shami Chakrabarti’s recommendations must now follow.There is also the wider problem of Labour’s support base – particularly younger voters – being so much less likely to vote than older affluent Tory voters, especially in local elections: that must be addressed. Increasing youth turnout isn’t enough, though – the party desperately needs to increase its appeal among older voters.It is difficult to conjure enthusiasm about local elections, full stop. Local authorities have such limited powers, and have been decimated by cuts, so it’s also much harder to offer the sort of radical policies Labour offered in the election and which turned its fortunes around. The party needs to advocate for radical devolution of powers so councils actually have teeth.There must also be reflection on the lack of political momentum since the election. Labour needs to recapture the sense of insurgency it exuded in last year’s campaigning. That’s difficult without parliament being dissolved again: Labour can’t otherwise benefit from broadcast impartiality rules that would grant it unfiltered access to the public, or a massive uptick in political interest which is a precondition for a viral social media campaign. The party needs to pick some fights that emphasise iding lines with the Tory party.Labour’s expectations management was poor, too, and that’s partly why victories – which have built on Labour’s general election result – are being presented as defeats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn.

Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa .

They really stirred the imagination. I felt like those clouds had been an inspiration for British writers to create lots of fantasy works. It looked as if some hidden castle were about to emerge from them.”It’s rare the tourist who comes to Britain and enthuses about our overcast skies, but Yonebayashi and his team were on a mission. They were researching for their new animated feature Mary and the Witch’s Flower, based on the 1971 children’s book The Little Broomstick by Mary Stewart. The story is set in rural Shropshire, where a country girl’s discovery of a magical flower whisks her into a world of witchcraft and adventure. Yonebayashi opted to retain the original setting, so despite being Japanese in name and manufacture, the film feels quintessentially and unmistakably British, from the chintzy furnishings to the toaster in the kitchen to the herbaceous borders in the garden.Yonebayashi is best known for his films When Marnie Was There and Arrietty, both made with Studio Ghibli, Japan’s pre-eminent animation house. The announced retirement of Ghibli’s founder and resident genius auteur, Hayao Miyazaki (who subsequently changed his mind), prompted Yonebayashi to part ways and set up his own Studio Ponoc. The continuity is evident in the vibrant, hand-drawn animation and themes of prepubescent female self-identification, but also in the source material: all three of Yonebayashi’s movies have been based on books by British authors. When Marnie Was There was an adaptation of a 1967 novel by Joan G Robinson, while Arrietty was of Mary Norton’s classic The Borrowers. Those were transposed to Japanese settings, largely for the benefit of domestic audiences. Given the choice, Yonebayashi opted to set his latest in England. It was his first visit. “We were familiar with English scenery through such works as Peter Rabbit and Thomas the Tank Engine,” says Yonebayashi. “What was different from what we imagined was the colours of trees and leaves and flowers. So many different tones and shades!” From their bed and breakfast in Leintwardine, the director, his producer and art director toured the Shropshire area viewing local manor houses, thumbing the Yellow Pages for gardens to visit, asking locals what to see. Yonebayashi is full of enthusiasm, for the landscape, the hospitality he received, the soft fruits, even the cuisine. “We had an English breakfast every morning and it was fantastic. However, at times we felt that we wanted to eat something else.” Not even the constant rain fazed him. It reminded him of his home town in Ishikawa prefecture, roughly halfway along Japan’s northern coast. “There is a proverb in my region: even if you forget your packed lunch, don’t forget your umbrella.”Looking back, Studio Ghibli has always had a bit of a love-in with Europe in general, and Britain in particular. As a student, Miyazaki became interested in children’s literature, including the works of Rosemary Sutcliff and Philippa Pearce. Last year, he published a list of his 50 favourite children’s books – 20 of them were British. He made trips to Italy and Sweden in the 1970s when he was attempting (unsuccessfully) to adapt Heidi and Pippi Longstocking, and many of his early features have quasi-European settings, from his debut, Castle of Cagliostro (set in a fictional European state) to 1920s aviator tale Porco Rosso (set in the Adriatic) to Kiki’s Delivery Service, another tale of a girl witch, whose location was primarily modelled on Stockholm.Most intriguing of all is Miyazaki’s 1986 fantasy adventure Castle in the Sky, a tale of airborne pirates, technological terrors and a mythical floating city which does, indeed, emerge from the clouds (it is named Laputa, after the flying island in Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels). The story’s boy hero lives in what looks like a 19th-century mining community. It is based on Wales, which Miyazaki first visited in 1984, just after the miners’ strike. The country seems to have struck a chord. “I really admired the way the miners’ unions fought to the very end for their jobs and communities, and I wanted to reflect the strength of those communities in my film,” he told an interviewer in 1999. “I saw so many places with abandoned machinery, abandoned mines – the fabric of the industry was there, but no people. It made a strong impression on me.” He also related to the Welsh and other Celtic people’s struggle for nationhood and cultural identity, in the face of outside invasion since Roman times. Two decades later, he adapted a novel by Welsh author Diana Wynne Jones, Howl’s Moving Castle.As with Hollywood, Japan’s anime and manga industries are so huge and prolific, they are constantly hungry for source material, so it is almost inevitable some are set in Britain. The Victorian, steampunk-friendly era is a particular favourite. Katsuhiro Otomo followed up his legendary Akira with 2004’s Steamboy, set in Victorian Manchester and London and taking in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Black Butler, AKA Kuroshitsuji, is a supernatural spy tale that crosses paths with Queen Victoria and Jack the Ripper. Emma follows a servant girl in class-conscious 1850s London. Read or Die centres on an agent for the “special operations ision of the British Library”.Here in the UK, we may question why Japanese animators are more engaged with our rich literary heritage than the domestic film industry seems to be. There is often uproar when Hollywood co-opts Japanese stories and culture, such as the recent remake of Mamoru Oshii’s Ghost in the Shell, or Netflix’s US-set adaptation of hit manga Death Note. Isn’t this the same thing? Should we be affronted? Not if it’s done in the right way, Yonebayashi says. “When we create works based on overseas culture, we really want to respect their countries and the original concepts the author wanted to portray.” By the same token, he appreciated Sofia Coppola’s Lost in Translation, which viewed modern Tokyo with the same curiosity he viewed Shropshire.Yonebayashi remains on good terms with Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli, he says. He worked there for 20 years before setting up on his own, and his latest film looks and feels like a continuation of Ghibli’s work. Asked to make a distinction, he suggests: “The late Studio Ghibli works tend to end with departures. However, when creating movies for children currently, I thought it was more important to show encounters than partings.” The sentiment feels in tune with his cultural eclecticism.Perhaps we should be grateful. Films such as Mary and the Witch’s Flower are expensive and time-consuming to make, with their painstakingly hand-rendered images and attention to detail. They are an endangered art, which is why few countries outside Japan still make them. It is hard to imagine anyone could have done a better job. If Britain no longer has the industry, it at least has the stories.Next, Yonebayashi has his eye on Scottish writer Alex Shearer. “I’ve read all his works, and I would really, really love to make a film out of one of his books.” This time, at least, we Brits beat them to it: BBC adapted Shearer’s story Bootleg into a Bafta-winning miniseries in 2002. Mind you, it was also made into a Japanese anime feature in 2008.• Mary and the Witch’s Flower is now on release"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41fab0a71d8dfbcaacd0a7da9aab9c3531dae4d4/855_224_5593_3356/master/5593.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcc842c4fbbdd967507449b2acf0989a","title":"vincent kompany what it feels like to be champions manchester city premier league title","story":"At the beginning of next season, Kompany will reach the 10-year milestone since he arrived at Manchester City, joining a club that back then was climbing fast but still wary of its supposedly innate ability to slip. The City of August 2008 suddenly came into Middle Eastern money but on the other hand had not won the title for 40 years. A handful of years previously they had not even been in the top flight of English football.Kompany is sitting in the middle of one of the buildings that make up the cavernous, advanced complex the club now operates from and his mind spools back. “It’s incredible,” he says. “It feels like it has been a month, honestly. There is so much experience, so much has changed over that time. Football is so intense you don’t have time to sit back and look at what you have achieved.”On day one, he did not even meet his team-mates. They had trained in the morning and he arrived in the afternoon so was put through his paces with a few members of staff. “I never met any of the players until the day after I arrived,” he says. “We had a very small session with the team. I never knew any names. I never knew anything about the team. Straight away I was put into the team by Mark Hughes. We played against West Ham, I was man of the match, we won 3-0 and that’s the kind of journey I have been on since. It has been wonderful.”On Sunday, he is set to lift the Premier League trophy for the third time at the official presentation, surrounded by talented team-mates who make up one of the great collectives in the history of the English game. Kompany is keyed up for a couple more records to sprinkle extra stardust on the occasion. City are three points off setting a new bar since the Premier League began promoting its own brand of history. They are a couple of goals away from breaking through another high. When you have won the league, does that really matter? Kompany’s answer reveals a lot about this intensely driven character.“We have to care now,” he says. “We keep having goals in front of us. My dream for next season is to come back and see a lot of guys hungry, having that desire to be better, and beat whatever we have achieved this season.”The old adage about it being tougher to stay at the top than get there chimes with him. It motivates him. “Staying there is a lot harder. Because you have to fight human nature. Once you achieve a goal and you are on that high, you have to consciously pull yourself in to say: ‘I need to have the same hunger and desire as when I had nothing.’ That’s the hardest thing to do in life. That is getting challenged every single day once you win titles.”Having Pep Guardiola around is a clear influence in respect of the repetition of success he enjoyed at Barcelona. “His inner drive is as impressive as his ability to be a good manager,” Kompany says. “I enjoy it because I really feel I can bounce off it.”He takes seriously his role as captain in talking to team-mates about their own hunger and the quest for the highest standards. “I have always been like this. When I was six or seven years old I remember players being scared of going back in the dressing room if we lost a game because they knew I would be waiting for them.” He laughs at the memory. “I have changed my ways a little. I am a lot more diplomatic. But I can’t change what is inside of me.“When I was coming through I had very little support from the older players. I always said to myself that if I make it I never want to be that kind of person. I have a passion for seeing young players develop, so every young player who comes into the first team I am willing to listen. I will give him everything I have.”Kompany feels such a strong sense of involvement in life at City. This season is not yet finished and he wants to push to go an extra mile next. He contemplates how this campaign has been a procession with a couple of blemishes. By the way, do not expect him to regard that emotional home defeat by Manchester United as a blemish. “The Man United game cannot be a blow. It is an opportunity missed,” he says. “But in the context of this season and the Premier League, what is there to complain about?“The Champions League is a different discussion. There has been a pattern, a historic one. Not even Pep, nor I, have been able to do anything about it. We didn’t lose to any European team that have shown they are better than us, we drew a Premier League team at Anfield which have been traditionally very difficult for Manchester City. We have a history with them, we had a great chance to turn it, and we were not able to do it. Next year.” He nods to himself. “Will happen.”Kompany is 32 and even though he insists he feels “as fit as a spring chicken” he knows his playing career cannot be eternal. With that in mind the summer looms large. “I want to win the World Cup. Simple as that. I don’t have another one and another one to play the waiting game or the humble game.“Our generation has been described as a golden generation. I hate that term. In reality, it put goals ahead of what we were able to achieve. Now is the right time, with the blend and mix of ages and experience in the group.”As a deep thinker with a highly developed social conscience, travelling to Russia presents ethical questions. “It’s a valid topic but I would hate to jump on the bandwagon. I believe in the power of positive interaction and networking. What difference do we make if we make the gap between countries even bigger? What do we decide – we don’t talk to each other any more? We don’t see each other any more? Every single time you bring something positive to a country you have a chance to influence people and their mindset. Building walls and bigger ides, we have seen time and time again what it does.“I know what kind of world I want my children to grow up in. Punishing and ceasing communication is not good. We have the opportunity to bring something positive.”Kompany’s football experience means he wants to stay in the game for as long as he can. Whether that is at City or elsewhere he cannot say, even if the Manc part of his identity means he will feel “connected to the club for life”. He is willing to try anything from coaching an under-six team to Fifa president if that is where the opportunities take him.That is for then. For now, there is a title to cherish. If the first one meant something for its emotional punch, this one means something for its deeper substance. “The first title was living a dream for the first time, believing that good things happen to you as well,” he says. “This title is what it feels to be a champion. The first was more of a test of character. You had to fight 44 years of history, you had to fight that we had the reputation of always bottling it. To overturn this had a big, big impact on this club. This one is more a case of can you be undisputed champions? You are always the champions if you win it on goal difference or by one point, but if you win it like we did, it cannot be discussed. That is a very nice feeling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f9a801377fb82ef4b97539ffebdbe8308db42c8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=317f7cd6582f5d11f687f79f0b303046","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Arsène Wenger bids the Emirates goodbye, Chelsea hope for a Liverpool hangover and the relegation battle heats upResults elsewhere could secure Brighton’s Premier League status this weekend, but Chris Hughton’s side have been granted an early opportunity to get the job done themselves at the Amex on Friday night. Brighton have beaten United just once in their history and have already lost to them twice this season – both times at Old Trafford – in the Premier League and FA Cup. United’s unconvincing Cup quarter-final win came immediately after their feeble Champions League surrender against Sevilla, in a match Alexis Sánchez and Paul Pogba sat out as unused substitutes after failing to impress against the Spanish side. Both players have since hit their stride and are likely to feature on Friday, a state of affairs that suggests if Brighton are to beat United for the first time in nine attempts since 1982 they will have to do so the hard way. With Davy Pröpper back from a spell on the naughty step, Hughton must decide whether to pair him with Dale Stephens in his first choice central midfield partnership, or stick with Beram Kayal, who has impressed in the Dutchman’s absence. BGAnd so it’s farewell. This will be the last time most Arsenal fans see Arsène Wenger at the Emirates, at least until they unveil his statue. Thursday’s failure in Madrid denied the venerable Frenchman if not a fairytale farewell, then at least a glorious appendix. Such will be the emotion of the occasion that the match is almost secondary, and yet defeat would be an almost cruel humiliation, leaving Wenger’s side distant from the top five and level on points with Burnley themselves. Having failed to unlock one famously well-organised defence in the Europa League they immediately face another one – Burnley have conceded 16 fewer goals in the Premier League than Arsenal. “There’s a lot of noise around the game but we’ve got to go there and do a job,” says Nick Pope. “We’re not just going to turn up and make up the numbers, we’ve got to put our foot down and put our own stamp on the game.” Having conceded decisive, controversial stoppage-time goals in each of their last three meetings, some luck for Burnley against Arsenal is long overdue. SBThe fact that Swansea’s final two games of the season are against two of the three teams below them in the table means victory for Stoke against Crystal Palace in Saturday’s lunchtime kick-off will send West Brom down. With qualification for next season’s Champions League not yet assured, Tottenham will be rooting for Stoke in the hope that an inevitable sense of deflation at the Hawthorns will put an end to West Brom’s impressive rally under Darren Moore. Spurs were fortunate to draw the corresponding fixture at Wembley, when Salomón Rondón squandered a glorious opportunity in added time. With Mauricio Pochettino’s future the subject of some speculation, failure to beat the Premier League’s worst team for a second time could be a precursor to grave repercussions come season’s end. BGIf ever there is a good time to face Liverpool’s deadly front three then it’s this weekend. The exertions of their Champions League semi-final epic against Roma are sure to have an effect on Jürgen Klopp’s side but with a top four spot not yet assured, Liverpool cannot afford to take it easy. Chelsea have won their last three matches in the Premier League to keep alive their hopes of qualifying for Europe’s top competition next season, with Olivier Giroud’s form the catalyst for their revival. The France striker has a solid record against Liverpool, with five goals in his 10 Premier League appearances against them for Arsenal, and his new employers know only victory will do on Sunday. EASo far at home in the league this season, Manchester City fans have celebrated 58 goals and 15 victories. This weekend they will be celebrating again whatever happens in the game, with the trophy to be presented to after the final whistle. This will be their third Premier League title, but the first won with sufficient comfort to plan the presentation. Victory on Sunday would take them to 96 points, a tally never previously reached in the Premier League – for some time, the record books have been their only significant opponents. Huddersfield, though, were troublesome in the reverse fixture in November, when City came from behind to win thanks to Raheem Sterling’s late goal, and given their position in the table could hardly be better motivated to poop the party. A reminder of how fast situations in football can change: Huddersfield have scored 27 goals in the league this season the last team to score fewer than 30 top-flight goals and avoid relegation were Manchester City, in 2006-07. SBOne point and a place above the relegation zone, Swansea City will drop into the bottom three if they fail to beat Bournemouth and Southampton win at Everton. While nerve-wracking, this scenario would not necessarily constitute disaster – with home matches against Southampton and Stoke to come, Swansea’s destiny remains in their own hands. Nevertheless, they could do with getting back into the winning habit, but Carlos Carvalhal’s inclination towards caution on the road could hamstring their chances of a first victory since the beginning of March. While it would be harsh to be critical of Swansea for their hiding against Manchester City, but their supine performance at the Hawthorns spoke volumes. Despite playing the worst team in the ision, Swansea could scarcely have been set up more cautiously and were lucky to secure a point. At Bournemouth they will be better served by starting with similar urgency to that with which they ended last weekend’s defeat to Chelsea. If they are to go down, why not do so swinging haymakers? BGPaul Lambert’s jack-in-the-box antics on the touchline have been a highlight of this season’s relegation battle and with his Stoke side fighting for survival at home against Crystal Palace on Saturday, expect the 1997 Champions League winner with Borussia Dortmund to be on top form. Lambert can take heart from Stoke’s victory over Palace last season – the first time they have beaten them in seven attempts – as they start the game three points from safety. Roy Hodgson’s side gained revenge in November and, with 38 points already in the bag, look to be safe after successive home wins. Yet Palace fans of a certain vintage will be wary of celebrating too soon – in 1992-93, the Premier League’s inaugural season, the Eagles were relegated with 49 points from their 42 games. EAEverton have lost only one of their last seven games, and that was against Manchester City. There was a time this season when they were genuinely concerned about the relegation scrap at the end of the season and so it has proved – in a manner of speaking. They are comfortably in the top half of the table, but having beaten Huddersfield last week to leave the Terriers in peril, they now face Southampton, with West Ham still to come. This is the third time that Everton have played Southampton in their final home game of the season, and the second time they have done so with one more away league match to follow. The last time it happened, in 1986, Everton were destined to finish second to Liverpool in both league and FA Cup, and the Saints were given a 6-1 thrashing. Two days later Southampton travelled to Tottenham and lost 5-3. Peter Shilton’s injury meant 17-year-old Keith Granger was flung into the side after conceding 11 in those two games, he never played for the club again. SBGiven their previous in the field of downing tools for managers , it will be intriguing to see how Leicester’s players approach this game. Claude Puel’s future looks uncertain in the wake of his team’s slaughter at Crystal Palace and with nothing much to play for, the reaction – or lack thereof – of his players will be telling. Still in danger of going down, West Ham will be hoping there is mutiny in the air over the King Power Stadium and look likely to bring Andy Carroll along. The striker apologised to David Moyes following an act of petulance and subsequent training ground row, prompted by his manager’s refusal to give him a run-out against Manchester City from the bench. Should both sets of players fail to up their game after respective embarrassments, fans can look forward to witnessing one of the most lethargic “contests” in top-flight history. BGSince winning four successive matches to secure top-flight status, Newcastle have looked distinctly mediocre in losing to Everton and West Brom. Here though, they meet a side whose motivation is similarly suspect, though it is hard to know if this match will be entertainingly carefree or demoralisingly careless. This is familiar territory for Watford: since promotion in 2015 they are yet to win a fixture in May. They have not won since the first weekend of March, their dismal away form has prompted their gentle slide down the table. Having lost 2-0 at Spurs on Monday, they declared themselves encouraged. “We managed to create chances and if we keep doing it we will begin to get results,” said Étienne Capoue. “If we play like that we will get the points against Newcastle.” With only a visit to Old Trafford to come, if Watford are to reach 40 points they surely have to.

By Colin CrummyClaire Ratinon, 34, was working in TV production in New York when she stumbled across Brooklyn Grange, an acre of rooftop farm seven storeys up in Queens. “I looked across at the Manhattan skyline while standing among kale, peppers and tomatoes, growing in the middle of the sky, and fell in love,” she says. Ratinon, from Surrey, started volunteering, picking tomatoes and getting sunburnt. It sowed the seed of something: “It was the calmest, cleanest place in the city and somewhere my soul was saying, this is where you need to spend more time.”Brooklyn Grange appeared at the right time in Ratinon’s life. After three years living in the US, she had begun to question what she was eating. The urban farm, where everything is grown organically, showed Ratinon a different way of food production. She took time off work and spent several months there with other apprentices, learning how to grow crops organically, before moving back to London in late 2014. There, she sought out growing communities and trained as a patchwork farmer at the Hackney-based social enterprise Growing Communities – growing salads at one of nine small market gardens – and as a beekeeper and gardener at the Bee Friendly Trust charity. She was also the lead gardener on Farmopolis, an ambitious arts space with a garden created from thousands of donated plants from the 2016 Chelsea flower show.There is huge potential in urban food growing, she says, and she is determined to be at the forefront. “Urban soil is some of the richest we have because it isn’t subjected to the pesticide and fertiliser that industrialised systems mete out on the countryside.”With organic growing, she says, “you are producing food without taking anything else away. Your whole practice is about working with nature and enriching the environment at the same time as feeding people. I feel very passionate about that.” In the meantime, she is spending the summer on an organic farm in Wiltshire, harvesting asparagus. Ratinon is also drawn to the therapeutic potential in urban farming. “When I walk into an urban growing space there’s a sense of relief,” she says. “They feel like some of the safest, most beautiful spaces I’ve been into.”Favourite plant Tomatoes. They taste approximately one thousand times better than any you’d get in the supermarket. Tumbling Toms can be grown really easily.Hates Slug pellets. I get why people use them for their ornamentals, but not accepting you have to share your garden with the natural world really bugs me out.Next big thing For growing to become part of mental health care as an alternative therapy.Alexander Hoyle, 25, is a horticultural hit on social media with 25k followers on Instagram. They are drawn to his daily updates from his day job as plantsman at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, in London. His posts of roses, bluebells and the occasional peacock celebrate the traditional English garden in an intoxicating blend of blooms and borders.Real life is not quite as rosy. “It’s an absolute nightmare for dating,” Hoyle says of his dedication to the role, “because you have to find someone who is like-minded. They have to love plants, and that can be tricky. Even though they think it’s romantic and wonderful, there’s the reality of having to look after the plants – and sometimes the plants come first.”Hoyle’s love affair with the English garden dates back to a childhood spent in the Cotswolds. His late mother was a gardener, the family patch part of the National Garden Scheme. “It’s just there,” he says of the desire to dig. “You suddenly want to be outside, you have a sense of pride and ownership.” So he worked at a local nursery during school holidays and visited Chelsea with his grandparents. (“I was in awe,” he says.) He went to plant fairs, collected pelargoniums, and at 16, began studies in horticulture at Pershore College, Worcestershire.It was Hoyle’s first gardening job, age 11 at a local 17th-century manor house, that settled the matter. “That got me going at first it was mowing grass, clearing up fallen fruit and squashing lily beetles,” Hoyle says. “The vicar used to pay me 20p a beetle. I had small hands that caught them quickly.”After completing his first horticultural course, Hoyle spent two years working at Aberglasney Gardens in Carmarthenshire, west Wales. The head gardener was Kew-trained and encouraged Hoyle to take up further study. He studied the Kew Diploma for three years before securing a permanent position there, helping to manage the Rose Garden, the Great Broad Walk Borders, Palm House pond and Victoria Gate entrance. These are some of Kew’s choicest spots, which Hoyle shows off to his online following.Hoyle’s passion has taken him around the world. A tour of rose gardens in America included the White House, accessed through American gardening friends. He is preparing for a similar rose-centred tour of Australia and there is a book in the works.He’s clearly set for big things, but for now, he says, the plan is to stay at Kew. “I consider myself a plantsman, finding solutions and working with designers,” he says. Just don’t describe any of this as a day job. “When I meet new people, they say, your job’s great. And I’m like, no, no that’s my life.”Favourite plant Roses.

The site has 82k subscribers.Richards built his social media profile while boarding on scholarship at Llandovery College. A head boy there, he gardened, filmed and edited in his spare time (he’s produced more than 400 videos). He was awarded a £5,000 grant to promote sustainable food, won a national young entrepreneur award and made £12,000 by his 18th birthday. He listens to the podcasts of entrepreneurial self-help guru Gary Vaynerchuk while in the garden. “Gary’s been the biggest influence in my life,” he says. “He’s very strategic and tries to push positivity. His mindset has really helped me develop.”Despite getting three Bs in his A-levels, Richards did not apply to university but dedicates most of his time to Huw’s Nursery while working part-time teaching gardening at his former school. The long-term plan is the big time. “I’d love to be a gardening presenter because I think I’d appeal to a younger demographic,” Richards says. “The average age of gardening presenters and writers is a lot older than I am. I’ve been doing this all by myself. I’ve had 20m views online.”Richards has met a number of production companies, a management agency and a publisher this year. But some opportunities he is minded to decline. “On my Facebook page, some older ladies wanted me to do a topless gardener calendar,” he laughs. “But I don’t think so.”Favourite plant Rainbow chard. It’s colourful, and although it has a short shelf life, it’s a really productive green – the stems are delicious with a bit of butter.Hates The low ersity of varieties in supermarkets. It makes people less excited about vegetables.Next big thing Swede, because it makes a great alternative to mashed potatoes. It goes really well with stronger-flavoured foods and grows well in our climate.The powerful partnership of Tamara Bridge and Kate Savill, both 30, is rare in usually male-centric gardening circles. Both run inidual, award-winning garden design practices, but also collaborate on show gardens. In 2017, they pooled their talents for a BBC Radio 2 Feel Good Garden at Chelsea this year they are back to create an artisan garden for a craft gin company. “Architects work together in big practices so why should it be different with garden designers?” says Bristol-based Savill.The pair met in competition at RHS Tatton Park flower show in 2015 where they were both up for Young Designer of the Year. Bridge won, and Savill was awarded a gold medal – not bad for her first show garden. The two hit it off when they spent three weeks living side by side in a camper van (Bridge) and a tent (Savill) at the show. “It started off just Tamara and me in a field, two girls cracking on for weeks,” says Savill.Collaborating has been a great creative experience, says Bridge, whose practice is based in Norfolk. “Partnerships can be seen as quite a sparky relationship, but we are the opposite, we get calmer.” They consult each other on their inidual projects and say working together only adds to the sum of the work, even if Savill tends to have the final tweak.“Kate waits till I’ve gone off site,” Bridge laughs. “I get quite stressed about changing things on site so she’ll wait until I’ve gone and sneak in.” In her defence, Savill always makes her partner aware of the alterations.For their Chelsea show, Bridge and Savill are heading a team of 22, which splits squarely on gender lines: the construction side is exclusively male, the planters mostly women. The construction team gets paid first and the planters only if budget allows. The women, therefore, tend to be volunteers. It’s accepted practice generally, say Bridge and Savill, but it’s beginning to get their goat. “Why is it acceptable for a project to run like that?” says Bridge. “The next time we do this it’s at the top of our list of things that won’t happen. It does make me quite cross.”Favourite plant Bridge: I love a wild strawberry. Chives are great because the flower is edible and you can pull it off and sprinkle it on your salad for a spring onion taste.Hates Bridge: bad lawn edges. I like a nice crisp edge with no tufty bits. If you have a flowerbed with an edge on the lawn, it needs to be neat and tidy.Next big thing Savill: crazy paving is making a big wave at the moment.Lachlan Rae is living the good life on a grand scale. The 25-year-old gardener lives in a cottage on the private Auchendolly estate, near Aberdeen in Scotland, with his wife and three young children, all under the age of six. “It’s a lovely big garden for me to take ownership of,” says Rae, who is originally from Dumfries. “You walk out of the door and you’re at your work. It’s a nice way to live.’Working alone or with his wife, Sian, Rae insists on traditional horticultural practices where possible. “I like to think of myself as an arts and crafts gardener. There’s no automated watering, it’s all watering cans. Instead of using plastic canes everywhere, I cut hazel twigs up in the woods and use that for staking plants to keep the environmental footprint down.”Rae left school at 16 and took seasonal work as a Christmas tree cutter and then a self-employed gardener, where his lack of expertise exasperated him. “People were asking me questions I couldn’t answer.” After taking a local gardening course he enrolled on the horticulture with plantsmanship course at the Royal Botanical Garden, Edinburgh. The academic grounding helped Rae win last year’s Young Horticulturalist of the Year, a national competition run by the Institute of Horticulture which tests the scholarly mettle of gardeners under 30 across categories that include horticultural science and practice plus plant, pest and weed identification.These wider aspects of gardening often go overlooked, says Rae. “There’s a lot more to horticulture than just gardening there’s a lot of science and it’s artistic,” he says. ‘I don’t know that the message is out there about the range of jobs. Gardening is just seen as pushing a wheelbarrow about all day. Schools are at fault it’s seen as a career for the no-hopers.”Rae moves to a new role this month as head gardener on Wiston Estate, in West Sussex. He will be in charge of a four-person team, all under 25, that will maintain 17 acres of public gardens. “It’s just what I need, a new challenge.”Favourite plant Cercidiphyllum japonicum, also known as the katsura tree. It’s not a beauty but it has small flowers which come out en masse in a faint ripple of colour.Hates Plastic green string you get in garden centres. It’s horrible. I prefer jute twine, which is a bit more rustic and natural.Grow now Plants with purpose like cut-and-come again salads, which can be grown on windowsills.Ula Maria Bujauskaite’s gardens are infused with ideas about time, memory, connections. Stepping into one should feel like a holiday from life. “When I design someone’s garden, it’s important to look at what inspires them and what kind of environment they feel happiest in,” says the 25-year-old RHS Young Designer of the Year 2017. “People draw from their experiences of being on holiday or from their childhood, time spent in nature. A lot of my work is an interpretation of that happy place in the garden.”Bujauskaite’s award-winning garden, Studio Unwired – shown at last year’s RHS Tatton Park flower show – drew inspiration from her own happy place, the Baltic coastline of her childhood. She created an outdoor working space informed by the earthy, serene summers of the Lithuanian seaside.Bujauskaite knew from childhood that she wanted to pursue design. She attended the Fine Arts School in Lithuania from age 12 until her family moved to Northampton in 2008, and she took a 3D design course in Milton Keynes followed by one in Landscape Architecture at Birmingham City University. There she was awarded the Landscape Institute’s John Knight award twice, for degree and master’s projects.The personal connections in Bujauskaite’s work first surfaced here her master’s explored the benefits of garden spaces for patients in palliative care. “I was 17 when my mum passed away from cancer. I had to spend a lot of time in a hospice with her and I wished there was a garden to walk out into and just spend some time in,” she says. The therapeutic aspects of colour, texture and how a garden view can offer relief to patients are elements Bujauskaite would like to touch on again in future work. “A garden can change people’s experience of going through something sad or horrible,” she says.Favourite plant Grasses: at sales, people pick the bright colours and all the grasses are left behind, which I love most.Grow now If you live in a flat, grow herbs like rosemary or mint or anything flowering that would enliven the space.Next big thing Wabi-sabi, from Japanese culture, is seeing beauty in imperfection. The cracks in timber or paving can be beautiful, too, because they show the ageing or time passing by. Will Williams, 22, had a rude awakening to gardening. At 16, having left school, he got a job with a local landscape gardener in Sussex. The 5.30am start and 12-hour working days were a steep learning curve. “It matured me very quickly,” he says. “I remember a lorry dumped four tonnes of sand at the front of a terraced house. I was passed a spade and a bucket and told to get all the sand round the back. That was a long day.”He has advanced remarkably quickly since. His passion for gardening deepening, he took a local course near his family home in Sussex. At 18, having saved half the fees, with the remainder paid by his parents, Williams became the youngest diploma student at London College of Garden Design. He went it alone after graduating, specialising in residential garden design, freelancing for his “bread and butter”, then winning projects against industry veterans. “I had nothing to risk, and in five years’ time I probably would have, so it was the perfect time to show the industry what I’ve got at quite an early age by myself,” Williams says.Williams’ next show sees him up for the RHS Young Designer of the Year 2018 (the winners are announced in July). At One is a show garden about balance, pleasing to humans and attractive to bees, butterflies and bugs. His ultimate ambition is a main avenue garden at Chelsea flower show. And while he is still young (a landscaper once refused to work with him because he looked so fresh-faced), Williams believes starting so early has been to his advantage. “Lots of people are career changers so they might not have as much experience as I do,” he says. “This is all I have really known from the age of 16. My youth hasn’t stopped me yet.”Favourite plant The amelanchier tree. It has an architectural value throughout the seasons, beautiful white flowers in spring, deep reds in autumn.Grow now Herbs, chillis and edibles. Things you can use in cooking daily.Next big thing Indoor gardening. I’ve seen (prototype) vertical bookcases with a massive vegetable garden like a fridge, with all the light you need to grow indoors.• Commenting on this piece?

The number of surrogacy agreements may, though, be far larger – some estimates suggest up to 500 a year. The figures are growing. Before 2008, the number of parental orders in the UK was fewer than 50 a year. Surrogate mothers cannot receive payments, but their expenses, usually up to £15,000, will be covered. A law commissioner for England and Wales, Prof Nick Hopkins, said: “Our society has moved on from when surrogacy laws were first introduced 30 years ago and, now, they are not fit for purpose.“For many, having a child is the best day of their lives and surrogacy can be the only option for some who want a genetic link to the baby. But the issues are difficult and there is no quick fix. Now we want all those with an interest to get involved and help us make the law fit for the modern world.”The review, which will cover the whole of the UK, is being done in conjunction with the Scottish Law Commission. One of its commissioners, David Johnston QC, said: “Surrogacy is becoming more common every year, so it’s important that we have the right laws in place to protect all involved. That’s why we’ll be consulting widely to make sure we have surrogacy laws that work for the parents, the surrogate and, most importantly, the child.”One problem with the law is the slow process of granting parental orders through the courts, which makes it difficult for the intended parents to make medical decisions about their child. The legal process can only begin after the baby is born. Uncertainty over UK legislation is thought to be encouraging the use of international arrangements with birth mothers overseas – an area in which there are concerns about the exploitation of surrogate mothers.The review will also examine how surrogacy is regulated and how it may be improved. The commission, which can initiate reviews on its own, is working more closely with government departments to boost its small amount of core funding and identify where more urgent changes to the law are required."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a088628fdf84c431288e0b65149daa5bfbdc63d/0_19_1450_870/master/1450.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69f2c8a3e8b5cb5dbdb988d2d3228496","title":"think special just proves you are normal","story":"There’s a reason Big Tech knows us so much better than we think – each of us is far more normal than we realiseAmong the creepier experiences of modern life is one that happens to me, though definitely not just me, on a regular basis: I’ll meet a friend for a drink, he’ll recommend some book or film or product he thinks I’ll like, and then, within days – without searching for it online – I’ll start seeing targeted web ads for it. No wonder there’s a persistent rumour that Facebook uses the microphone in your phone to eavesdrop on your conversations. That’s almost certainly false: the truth is that apps and websites already vacuum up so much of your data, they’ve no need for such schemes it just feels that they must be eavesdropping. But there’s another reason Big Tech knows us so much better than we think, which is that each of us is far more normal than we realise.Given a little information about me, both Facebook and my friend alight on the same recommendation because my constellation of interests is far less special, and thus more predictable, than I’d like to\u0026nbspbelieve.“You’re not so special” is a message sometimes delivered as an insult (as in “special snowflake”) and sometimes as tough love, as in the viral 2012 speech by the American high-school teacher David McCullough, urging students not to make themselves miserable by struggling to prove they’re the centre of the universe. It’s also frequently an accusation flung at the young by the old.But all that’s really just a distraction from the brute statistical fact: on any given dimension, all else being equal, of course you’re probably normal. Shorn of any value judgment, that’s all the word “normal” means. Your intelligence, your creativity, your tastes in culture or romantic partners, the degree to which the world has mistreated you: the chances are they’re much less quirky or extreme than you think, especially since we’ve each got strong ulterior motives to believe otherwise. Or to put it another way: thinking you’re special is just one more way in which you’re normal. This is the famous Lake Wobegon phenomenon known as “illusory superiority”, which explains why most people think they’re above average at driving, at being unbiased, and various other things. Though it works the other way, too: imposter syndrome is a classic case of thinking\u0026nbspyou’re special, but in a\u0026nbspnegative way.The trouble is that both the positive and negative forms of thinking you’re less normal than you are lead to misery – either by convincing you you’re unusually bad, or by turning life into an isolating, adversarial exercise in maintaining your sense of being unusually good. The latter also means that any aspect of your life or experience that’s just ordinary – which, by definition, is going to be most of them – feels like an affront to your identity. “Never forget that every mind is shaped by the most ordinary experiences,” wrote the French poet Paul Valéry. “To say that something is ordinary is to say it is of the kind that has made the biggest contribution to the formation of your most basic ideas.” To disdain the normal means disdaining most of what happens. Doing that is pretty normal, too, to be honest. But it’s a recipe for a joyless life.• Read: Nothing Special, by the late American Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck, is a perspective-shifting exploration of what’s so remarkable about the everyday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14c42fbbc71bf1b6ce5552183fed429441be0f42/1328_1037_3873_2324/master/3873.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=760a3efffdead65001fbb70dccb6f2ad","title":"thomasina miers recipe sea bream anchoiade crust hasselback potatoes","story":"This anchovy-topped fish is covered in a crunchy crumb and served with crisp yet velvety jersey royalsIs bread having a renaissance? Restaurants that make their own sourdough increasingly pepper their menus with the leftovers. And why not? I love coming across a crunchy golden breadcrumb in a salad, on a pudding, or as a crust, like here. Today’s anchovy-decked fish fillet is given a delicate layer of crunch with a scattering of crisp crumbs. Never throw out that stale loaf.Hasselbacks (baked sliced potatoes) are such a treat, but if you’re short of time, omit the slicing and roast the potatoes whole to cut down your prep time by 10 minutes.80g anchovies, drained1 heaped tsp capers1 small garlic clove, peeled and roughly chopped2 egg yolks100ml extra-virgin olive oil, plus extra for drizzling4 fillets sea bream or other white fish1 small handful parsley 8 tbsp dry breadcrumbs1 tsp pul biber (Turkish chilli flakes)For the potatoes24 small jersey royals (about 1kg) 40g butterSalt and black pepper A few sprigs thyme, leaves picked40g olive oilPrep the potatoes first. Heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Put a potato on to a tablespoon or wooden spoon and, using a small, sharp knife, make incisions at 2-3mm intervals along the potato without cutting all the way through – the spoon helps stop your knife cutting all the way down. Repeat with the rest of the potatoes.Melt the butter in a small pan. Put the potatoes in a baking tin, season with salt and pepper, and toss in the butter, thyme and oil. Roast for 35-45 minutes, (the time will depend on the size of the potatoes), basting the potatoes in the fat a few times during cooking.Meanwhile put the anchovies, capers, garlic, egg yolks and oil in a medium-sized bowl and blitz to a smooth emulsion with a handheld blender. Taste and check for seasoning – the anchovies will provide the salt, but a few generous grinds of black pepper will make all the difference. Line a baking tray with greased baking paper or foil, and put the fish fillets on top.Wash the parsley, pick the leaves (discarding the stems) and finely chop. Toss into the breadcrumbs and chilli flakes. Spread a heaped teaspoon of the anchovy emulsion over the skin of each fillet, followed by a generous layer of parsley breadcrumbs. When the potatoes are almost ready, drizzle the fillets with a little oil (about two teaspoons), then roast alongside the potatoes as the potatoes for 10-12 minutes (or longer, if you have a thicker fillet of cod or hake), until the breadcrumbs are golden and toasted and the fish gently flakes. Serve the fish and the golden potatoes with a crisp, green salad and a wedge of lemon.Thankfully, you will have some anchovy mayonnaise left, and it is wonderful on a chargrilled steak or lamb chop and great with crudités (think fennel wedges, red pepper and chicory).

Corbyn’s party also lost control of Derby council, and the Conservatives gained seats in towns such as Dudley and Nuneaton.The Labour leader said: “In a sign of how worried they are about Labour’s advance, the Tories talked up our chances to unrealistic levels, especially in London.“The results show they are right to be worried: we came within a whisker of winning Wandsworth for the first time in over 40 years.”Meanwhile, the Conservatives celebrated winning in Basildon and Peterborough, and Theresa May went to Wandsworth to congratulate party workers and councillors.Overall, the results yielded few signs that either party has advanced strongly since last year’s general election resulted in a hung parliament. Andrew Gwynne, Labour’s co-national campaign coordinator, described Thursday’s contests as “an election of consolidation”.Prof Philip Cowley, a political scientist at Queen Mary University of London, suggested Labour had allowed expectations to run out of control.“In both Westminster and Wandsworth, Labour did better – in seats – than at any election since 1986. To have managed to so misjudge the politics of the election that this is presented as a bad result is quite spectacular.”Judged by the numbers of seats, Labour put in its best performance ever in a series of outer London boroughs, including Ealing, Croydon, Enfield and Waltham Forest.But the biggest blow for the party came in Barnet, its main target in the capital, where it needed to gain just one seat to take control. Instead, the north London council moved into overall Conservative control, amid Labour recriminations about antisemitism.By early morning Labour had gained seats but failed to make the advances it had hoped for in London. The Conservatives lost seats but were relieved to cling on to key councils. Brandon Lewis, the Conservative party chairman, said his party had a “reasonable night, a good night”. Jeremy Corbyn celebrated seizing Plymouth council and said he was delighted by the result. One pollster estimated that a general election matching these results would see Labour with a similar number of seats to the 262 it scored in 2017, while the Tories would lose 12.Surprise success for two Green candidates against Conservative incumbents helped Labour become the biggest party in the Manchester council, one of its biggest successes of the night. I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group on Trafford council. “This is far beyond our expectations.The party celebrated as it took control of Richmond by gaining 22 seats and had some other good results. Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, said: It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.” But elsewhere Vince Cable’s party showed no signs of enjoying the sort of recovery that would see it turn into a strong force at Westminster.Ukip\u0027s vote collapsed and by Friday morning it held just two seats, 44 down on four years ago. General secretary Paul Oakley tried to put a brave face on things by comparing the party to the Black Death. It\u0027s not all over at all, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme. Think of the Black Death in the Middle Ages. It comes along and it causes disruption and then it goes dormant, and that\u0027s exactly what we are going to do. Our time isn\u0027t finished because Brexit is being betrayed. Dan Sabbagh and Andrew SparrowCorbyn told Labour supporters in Plymouth on Friday morning to celebrate the result, saying the polls showed his party was “ready for a general election whenever it comes”.Another council where a major Labour campaign effort failed to pay off was Swindon, a bellwether area. The party gained one ward from the Lib Dems but none from the Tories, who hung on to control of the Wiltshire council by one seat.Labour MP Lisa Nandy said her party needed to have a better answer to the problems faced by voters in towns such as her patch, Wigan, which have struggled with low wages, and the decline of high streets.“It’s about jobs, jobs, jobs jobs,” she said. “Politicians need to catch up. Whoever gets this towns argument will win the next general election and the one after that.“Unless Labour gets to grips with that, the next election is far from secure, with Labour piling up the votes in cities, and the Tories having a near-monopoly on the countryside.”Overall, in the first big test of voter opinion since the general election last year, the main parties remained deadlocked – a result more likely to buoy May. There had been predictions of a leadership challenge to the prime minister at one point if Thursday’s polls had gone badly for her.The Conservative party chair, Brandon Lewis, said they had enjoyed the better results. “It’s been a good night for us and it’s been a dreadful night for Labour,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They were promising to sweep the board in London, and they haven’t gained, at the moment, a single council in London.”The Liberal Democrats recorded the biggest gains in initial seat numbers, gaining control of Richmond in south-west London and retaining power in Cheltenham, Sutton and Eastleigh – albeit from a low base when the seats were last fought in 2014.Ed Davey, the party’s home affairs spokesman, told Today: “It’s a great night for the Liberal Democrats. We’ve been winning seats off Labour in the north in leave-voting areas. We’ve been winning in the south off Tories in remain areas. It’s building a hugely important platform for future victories.”The Greens took six early seats, including two in Trafford, from Conservatives. The co-leader, Jonathan Bartley, told the BBC: “If you’d told me four years ago this is where we’d be, I’d have been be thrilled.”Ukip, whose vote has collapsed since the EU referendum, lost 86 seats in early results, holding only two.Its former deputy chair Suzanne Evans conceded that the party could be in terminal decline. “If Ukip does crumble I think you could still arguably make the case that it’s been one of the most successful political parties in history.” In Labour’s most notable early success, it won four seats from the Tories in Trafford, taking its total to 30. After the surprise double win by the Greens in the Altrincham ward, the Conservatives were left with 29 seats, down from 33.“I’m absolutely ecstatic,” said Andrew Western, the leader of the Labour group. “This is far beyond our expectations. We hoped to tip the council into no overall control tonight, but to have become the largest party at the same time is a fantastic bonus.”Additional reporting by Frances Perraudin, Stephen Morris and Ben Quinn"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/885875f3668c0a788247a1a583c43296abc256d7/0_137_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a81ae07a72c023c6877c4e4b687524e","title":"local elections council england 2018 tories labour corbyn may","story":"Labour challenge falters in Wandsworth, Swindon and Kensington and Chelsea, but wins Plymouth and takes Trafford out of Conservative controlHere are some more results that have come in over the last hour or so.Blackburn with Darwen Lab No change Boundary change Lab down 7, C down 4, LD down 2 New council: Lab 37, C 13, LD 1 According to the Press Association, 133 out of 150 councils have now declared.

But the BBC has Labour on course to gain 21 seats, and the Tories on course to lose 38 seats, while Sky just anticipates more modest Tory losses.There’s a different between the two projections because the BBC and Sky use different methods to calculate how the local election results can be converted into a national share.The Liberal Democrats have gained Three Rivers, south-west Hertfordshire, from no overall control, the Press Association reports.

This is not the share of the vote figure in the actual elections (a fairly meaningless figure, because the councils where elections took place were not representative of Britain as a whole.) It is a calculation as to what the vote share would have been if all wards in Britain had voted in the same way as people voted yesterday. (More on how this works here.)These are the figures:Labour has retained Crawley after winning seven of the 12 seats being contested, the Press Association reports. The Conservatives won four, with one result to come.And the Tories are on course to retain control of Woking council in Surrey. According to Sky News, if there were a general election and people voted as they did in the local elections yesterday, there would be a hung parliament. Here are their figures.The only party that would celebrate a result like this would be the Lib Dems. They won 12 seats at the 2017 election, and so on the basis of this notional result, they would be up 14.Theresa May won 317 seats last year. On the basis of this result, she would be down 12.

Her win continued a dominant spring for the Dutch Boels-Dolmans squad who rode like the top team in the world even with Lizzie Deignan sidelined from racing through pregnancy and this spring’s prolific winner Anna van der Breggen remaining at home in the Netherlands .The reason for their success was obvious as a 14-woman lead group tackled the final kilometres up the Wharfe Valley through Pool and Otley: just as when Deignan won last year’s one-day race in Harrogate, Boels’ team work was impeccably disciplined, with each of their three riders in the decisive attack playing her role to perfection to deliver Guarnier the win on her 33rd birthday.“All my team-mates said I should give myself a good present today, and I knew I had to finish off their hard work,” she said after the 124km stage. The New Yorker added after the finish that her first win of the season was welcome but there was a little more to it than that.Her 2017 produced three World Tour wins, but was marred by two heavy crashes, the first of which in late February left her with concussion, while the second – on a descent in the world road championships in Oslo – resulted in a broken jaw and displacement. As this season started she was still wearing a mouth guard in bed to ward off spasms and was not at ease when eating.Behind Guarnier, Dani Rowe came within reach of a home win, finishing third on the stage behind ALE-Cipollini’s Belarussian Alena Amialiusik, but winding up 17sec behind Guarnier in second place in the overall standings, thanks to her haul of bonus seconds on stage one into Doncaster. Fresh from her bronze for Wales in the Commonwealth Games, she heads for a well-earned mid-season break.Still a relative novice in road racing at this level, Rowe continues her impressive progress following her move from the track, where she can boast six gold medals in the team pursuit. Unlike Guarnier, she had to play a solo hand – rather than her trade team WaowDeals she was riding here with a young Great Britain team, who had been blown away in the final kilometres – but she gauged her effort with impressive precision.As expected, the Doncaster winner Kirsten Wild did not figure in the final moves, but when she slipped backwards on Old Pool Bank the rider in the blue leader’s jersey had already played the team role she predicted she would, winning the opening sprint to deprive Elisa Longo-Borghini’s rivals of a potential time bonus before leading the peloton into the climb to set up the Italian’s attack.Boels’ team ethic was exemplified by their Canadian Karol-Ann Canuel and the world champion Chantal Blaak, both of whom worked hard to keep the 14-rider lead group clear after the split had been forced by Wiggle-High5 over the climb of Old Pool Bank, a straight, steep drag out of Pool in Wharfedale with 17.5km remaining. It was classic team work, enabling Guarnier to keep her powder dry.Canuel had done the bulk of the work up the valley, and it was Blaak who set the pace on the early phase of the climb out of Ilkley onto the moorland below the distinctive millstone grit outcrop and boulder which have lent their name to the pub by the finish line. Earlier, she had figured in an exploratory five-rider move that went clear as the race passed Harewood House on the outskirts of Leeds, and which began the final sort-out.For a world champion to do such menial work is not unprecedented but it underlined Boels’ absolute adherence to their plan, the final phase of which was Guarnier’s acceleration with 500m remaining to the line picked out next to a slope still covered in last winter’s dead bracken. The Cow and Calf is short compared to the ascents she conquered en route to victory in the 2016 women’s Giro d’Italia, but it was enough for her to open a decisive gap, with Amialiusik responding initially but slipping slowly back.Rowe took the opposite approach, keeping a controlled pace initially and producing her effort late to close on the Belarussian. “I really targeted this race, so I didn’t have a break after the Commonwealth Games,” she explained. “I know my body is more for sprinting so if I force it into the red I just blow. I knew how long the climb was and I couldn’t follow Megan, she’s a phenomenal climber while I am just learning the ropes. I could see Alena in front, and I knew I had to keep pushing to the line because I had those time bonus seconds in hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4bd09ace9622e9c89f95c322158ef6575bfff14a/37_305_5139_3084/master/5139.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acc2ed21e5dc551644fe50f7a5ab7c7c","title":"mendelssohn bred for date with destiny kentucky derby horse racing","story":"“It dominates their sport,” Ryan Moore said this week, “in the same way that Cheltenham dominates ours from January to the beginning of March. It’s their most important race, a really significant sporting event in their country and people really get behind it. From January through to the first weekend in May, the Kentucky Derby is what American racing is focused on.”It is a fair comparison in all but the intensity. Cheltenham is four days, 28 races and 70,000 racegoers on Gold Cup day. The Kentucky Derby, in which Moore will ride Aidan O’Brien’s Mendelssohn on Saturday, distils four months of trial races and building anticipation into 120 seconds of action, for a crowd of at least 150,000 people. On the first Saturday in May, Churchill Downs is, fleetingly, one of the great sporting crucibles, a place where racing history has been made for 144 years, two minutes at a time. Between them, Moore, O’Brien and Mendelssohn will never get a better chance to write a chapter of their own.There are no end of fables attached to the long list of Kentucky Derby winners, which includes such legends as Secretariat, Citation and Seattle Slew. Even the casual horseplayers here can tell you about the Curse of Apollo, named after the only horse to win the Kentucky Derby without having raced as a two-year-old. That was back in 1882, a few weeks after Jesse James was shot, and dozens of horses, including top-class performers such as Curlin and Forego, have tried and failed to emulate him since. Two more, Justify and Magnum Moon, are close to the top of the betting for this year’s race.But at least it has been done. The curse of the Europeans, however, is absolute: in 143 runnings since 1875, no horse trained in Europe has ever won the Kentucky Derby. Even the America’s Cup was finally unbolted from its display case at the New York Yacht Club after 132 years. The US’s greatest horse race has yet to cross the Atlantic.No previous contender from Europe, however, has arrived in Louisville just a few weeks after cantering to an 18-length win on a dirt track, boasting a pedigree that says Kentucky in every generation, or representing a trainer who has just set a world record for Group One winners in a year.Enter Mendelssohn, the strongest challenger from a European stable since at least 1992, when François Boutin’s Arazi set off at odds-on but finished eighth. Mendelssohn is perhaps an even stronger contender\u0026nbspthan Arazi, for all that he is not sure to start favourite. Arazi had undergone surgery to both his front knees before his run in Kentucky. By contrast, Mendelssohn’s passage towards the Bluegrass State has been serene.It has also been plotted very deliberately by one of the greatest trainers the sport has seen, from the moment he was bought for $3m (£2.2m) by John Magnier’s Coolmore syndicate at the US’s most\u0026nbspprestigious bloodstock sale. O’Brien has had a handful of runners in the race, but Mendelssohn, a dirt-bred colt whose half-sister Beholder was a five-time Grade One winner on the surface, was a Kentucky horse from day one.His price tag, which made him the top lot at the 2016 Keeneland Select Sale, was a gamble, but a carefully calculated one. Scat Daddy, Mendelssohn’s sire, was starting to become established as an outstanding stallion of dirt and turf horses when he died in 2015.The first prize in the Kentucky Derby is about $1.25m (£920,000), quite modest by global standards, but if a colt from one of Scat Daddy’s final crops could win, he would be worth tens of millions of dollars as a stud prospect. Justify, who will challenge Mendelssohn for favouritism in a 20-strong field, is another son of Scat Daddy who could be valued in the high eight figures by Saturday night.So the stakes could scarcely be higher as Moore and Mendelssohn prepare for an all-or-nothing race around a tight oval track where no favours will be asked or given. About 10,000 thoroughbred colts were foaled in 2015 in the US alone and just 20 three-year-olds will go to post with a once-in-a-lifetime chance to win a Kentucky Derby.Moore, who described his only previous experience of the Kentucky Derby as “the best day’s racing I have ever experienced”, must know that he will never have a better chance to win it.“It’s a very hard race for anybody to win,” he said, “and Justify has looked exceptional and Magnum Moon has looked very talented as well. We know what we want to do, but there are other people who want to do similar things.“But he’s bred for it, it’s an American pedigree and he’s meant\u0026nbspto do the job. That’s what he\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwas bred to do, to win the Kentucky Derby.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e23cb66c45ad44338a82117a5facbf49d0cd6ee0/17_0_1017_610/master/1017.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6250bd4cc14064151f08a530400f6a3","title":"victoria pendleton abandons everest climb on health grounds","story":"Former Olympic cyclist advised to cut short expedition due to effects of oxygen deprivationThe Olympic gold medallist Victoria Pendleton has reportedly abandoned an attempt to climb Mount Everest after suffering from the effects of oxygen deprivation.The cyclist-turned-jockey had set out for the summit with the TV presenter Ben Fogle and had reached the mountain’s second camp, 21,000ft (6,400 metres) above sea level, after spending weeks preparing for the final climb.But she started suffering the effects of hypoxia and was advised by her doctor to end her climb, according to The Daily .

The Springboks are reportedly keen to have him back for the 2019 World Cup andas with Kurtley Beale, Le Roux’s pace and eye for a gap will be conspicuously missed when he is gone. Jason Woodward and Telusa Veainu also make the podium.If Newcastle have startled some by finishing in the top four this season, the 34-year-old Goneva’s continuing impact is no surprise. The Fijian has now scored 53 career Premiership tries and his Alan Shearer-style celebration after scoring against Northampton at St James’ Park was among the season’s best images. In company with his team-mate Sinoti Sinoti, he retains a rare ability to terrify defenders.One of the unluckiest players in Britain deserved a change in fortunes and, finally, the injury-plagued centre has had a season to remember fondly. The 28-year-old has been at the heart of many of Gloucester’s best moments and with Bath’s Jonathan Joseph injured, his footwork and offloading skills have at least put him in the frame for England’s summer tour of South Africa.Has mostly filled the 13 jersey for the Chiefs but such is his midfield versatility it is hard to look past an entirely Henry-dominated midfield. If Exeter do retain their Premiership title, Slade’s skill-set will have been among the reasons why and he remains determined to feature in England’s 2019 World Cup plans. Another player for whom the coming weeks could prove highly significant.Worcester have not endured the easiest of seasons but there has been one consistent success story throughout. Currently the Premiership’s joint top try-scorer with 13 tries in 20 games, the Welsh wing has also made his Test debut and, at only 23, potentially has plenty of improvement still left in him. Sale’s Denny Solomona makes the bench.Due to leave Wasps again at the end of the season but is signing off with a genuine flourish. The extra dimension he brings in attack – ball in two hands, constantly keeping opponents guessing – has been a pleasure to watch at times, not least last weekend in front of Eddie Jones. Leaving aside his occasional capacity to rub some people up the wrong way, he remains the most watchable English fly-half of his generation.The best scrum-halves are constantly involved and De Klerk has been a wonderfully busy presence for Sale all season. He has played in every game, kicked goals on demand and blazed a trail for pint-sized No\u0026nbsp9s everywhere. Sale are an improving side and the South African has rapidly established himself as a crucial cog.Had it not been for their loosehead’s lengthy injury lay-off, Leicester might not have found themselves outside the Premiership’s top four for the first time since 2004. There are a lot of good up-and-coming looseheads out there – Alec Hepburn at Exeter, Beno Obano at Bath – but Genge’s bullocking ability in the loose makes him the scariest of the lot when the force is with him.Another player whose season has been disrupted by injury but seven tries in 11 league games is some strike-rate for a hooker. About to fade into retirement but has been as popular an overseas recruit as any in the Premiership’s history. At 36 he is still capable of producing ridiculous skills, his fizzing display on the season’s opening weekend against Northampton a particular highlight.When Schonert is on the field – and he has spent more time than he would prefer on the physio’s table – the Warriors’ scrum is as strong as any in the league. South Africa-reared but English qualified, there must be every chance of the powerful tighthead featuring on England’s summer tour back to his homeland. Could yet be a World Cup squad bolter.Any retiring player would love to walk away into the sunset with O’Callaghan’s fistful of honours: to feature in 18 Premiership games in the second-row in your late 30s also takes some doing. Included here for his inspiring determination to keep on raging against the dying of the light, even for a non-Irish club in the table’s lower reaches.Some people are still prone to underestimating Launchbury but his stamina and work-rate are reliably world-class. Combining the captaincy of Wasps with playing in the engine room for England has had its obvious challenges this season but rare, even so, are the days he does not complete the full 80 minutes for his club. A real Trojan.Quite obviously head and shoulders above some of those picked in England’s back row under Eddie Jones but still awaiting a senior Test start. Exeter will be perfectly happy if Jones keeps omitting him: it saves them the bother of having to make up for the endless lineouts claimed, metres gained, mauls driven and tackles made by their Zimbabwe-born force of nature.As with Armand, it does not particularly matter what number Simmonds wears on his back. Has only been a Chiefs regular for a little over a year but the ‘Teignmouth Torpedo’ and his fly-half brother Joe have arguably been the country’s two most improved players. If, as with Exeter, there are others on hand to add close-quarters power, his pace and footwork will stand out even more.This is fast becoming the era of the English-qualified, South Africa-reared forward. Ross is the latest contender to emerge, having impressed everyone in Manchester since arriving from Stade Français. Hard, durable and consistent – he has played in every one of Sale’s league games – he must be a contender for Jones’s summer squad, either at No6 or No8.Still possesses the canniest of eyes for rugby talent and, ably assisted by Dave Walder, has done a top job of revitalising the Falcons. Guiding the club to the play-offs in such competitive times is a serious achievement."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b80dfcaae6111150548ae898b19825b21b7b18c/0_76_8026_4815/master/8026.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e57734157bce6dc7534f3516a0268c0","title":"chef zoe adjonyoh on the smells that unlock family memories","story":"From the childhood smells of frying black pudding and burning peat in Ireland, to the traditional ingredients discovered in Ghana and Dalston, chef Zoe Adjonyoh has always followed her noseListening to Zoe Adjonyoh talk about her dual-heritage upbringing is like reading a foodie travelogue that immediately has you salivating. The daughter of an Irish mother and Ghanian father, she spent the first couple of years of her life with her extended family in Ghana before growing up in south-east London and holidaying in Ireland to visit her maternal grandmother. Food – heaps of food from cooks who wouldn’t tolerate anyone leaving the dinner table hungry – features strongly in childhood memories of long summer days in Bantry Bay, County Cork. “Some of my earliest memories are very specifically about the smell of food cooking in Ireland – cabbage, black pudding frying. My aunt had a butcher’s shop so I was used to seeing a pig’s head on the counter and cows’ tongues hanging on hooks. We ate lots of offal, but we also used to go to the beach to hunt for crabs, to the river for salmon, and to the mountain to dig out peat for the fire – that smell always unlocks memories of my mum and her family. Peat, the smell of the sea, the morning dew – that landscape had its own special smell, a smell of freshness.”Food from a very different landscape was how, as a keen home cook, Adjonyoh later discovered and explored her Ghanian identity. The mysterious ingredients her father brought home to cook with were the same ones she would use to create dishes for her pop-up supper club in Brixton and her debut cookbook, Zoe’s Ghana Kitchen, published to great acclaim last year. These staples of Ghanian cookery were, she says, her sensory “access points” to finding out about her African heritage.“My father would be cooking with things I’d never heard of I didn’t know what they were,” she recalls. “Before I could taste them, I’d be aware of their unfamiliar smell and that’s a really strong memory of him in the kitchen – I’d want to eat something just from the aroma while it cooked.” After travelling to Ghana as an adult, and experimenting with traditional dishes back at home in her Hackney Wick kitchen, she started cooking updated versions of the recipes for friends. She sourced produce from Dalston’s Ridley Road market, getting to know the Ghanian women who sold from kiosks. “Shopping there, for me, was like being transported to another world,” she recalls. “They would help me identify ingredients and tell me how to cook them. The smells, flavours and colours were just amazing.”Some of the smells when she visited Ghana were a little too amazing. At a market with her aunt, Adjonyoh asked what a particularly pungent smell was. “What smell?” said her aunt, and carried on shopping. It turned out to be some cowhide drying in the sun, ready for eating later. Laughing, she recalls her aunt’s brief explanation: “‘Oh that’s wele,’ and I said: ‘What the hell is wele?’” The flavour wasn’t as strong as the smell, once she plucked up the courage to try it. “I was a bit wary of it, to be honest.”While her father’s cooking was hearty and traditional, it was a case of “there you are, get stuck in, don’t bother with cutlery”, she explains.Adjonyoh adapted recipes to make them visually appealing (gloopy okra was transformed into okra fries) because of the adage about people eating with their eyes. But it was the smell of her peanut butter stew – based on her father’s legendary groundnut soup – that drew people to come and buy food from an impromptu stall at her flat. “The dish has an amazing smell profile from the blend of spices,” she says. “People were asking what the smell was, how the dish was made. It was very much the smell that brought people to my door.”A career in food wasn’t the plan, but the clamour for her African cooking paid her way through an MA in creative writing: “It was just the demand. I loved the cooking and so did all the people who tried it.” The supper club, with just six tables and housed in a shipping container, was born, and for three years celebrated the variety, richness and abundance of Ghanian food. Now it’s time for a new adventure, with Adjonyoh travelling across Kenya and Uganda for a month to meet female chefs, cooks and food bloggers: “I want to understand each country’s relationship with food, the history of that, their distinctive produce and why it is that their food industry is largely dominated by women.” The journey will once again unite her passions for cooking, writing and travel. “I can’t wait to soak up the sights and sounds of two new food cultures,” she says. “When you’re travelling, all your senses are heightened. The first thing that always draws me in is food smells. No doubt I’ll be led by my nose again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9121b39221135b313ab6a0f13afdd7a56a92889a/708_1427_4536_2722/master/4536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c46e479152591e798cebcb1f9806dbf","title":"tom davis funniest things","story":"The writer, standup and star of Action Team on the things that make him laugh the mostEddie Murphy Raw.

It is located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which has closed off nearly 6,350 hectares (15,700 acres) due to “the possibility of a new eruption and unstable geologic activity”.Most of Kilauea’s activity has been non-explosive, but an eruption in 1924 spewed ash and nine tonnes of rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo’s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring over 460 metres (1,500ft) high. In the decades since, the lava flow has buried large areas of land and destroyed many homes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c113e374c684f9bda11c7a2f7cc2e607135dc708/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7a146b27198199ec34175d1b34ac40f","title":"butchered rhino suggests humans were in the philippines 700000 years ago","story":"Excavation proves early humans colonised the area hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously believedThe discovery of a butchered rhino has led scientists to conclude early humans were in the Philippines as far back as 700,000 years ago.Dozens of human-made stone artefacts and tools, alongside the clearly bludgeoned and eaten remains of a rhino, were discovered in a clay bed in on Luzon, the largest and most northerly island in the Philippines. The excavation proves early humans colonised the Philippines hundreds of thousands of years earlier than previously believed, though it is thought these hominims, or ‘Hobbits’, pre-date modern humans, known as homosapiens. Previously, the earliest confirmed evidence of human presence on the island was a foot bone found in a cave in Luzon, which dates back just 67,000 years. Aside from their appetite for rhino, very little is known about the humans who would have occupied Luzon, and the researchers are hoping to uncover more archeological clues as they continue to dig.It is possible they were homo erectus, who are known to have wandered to present-day China and south-east Asia up to a million years ago or could be their own distinct sub-species. Until recently, it was believed Luzon and the other islands of Wallacea in the Philippines would have been impossible for pre-modern humans to reach, as they would not have boats to cross the deep water. However, the team of researchers, including paleontologist Dr Gerrit Van Den Bergh from the University of Wollongong, said this called for a rethink of how and where early homonims had travelled in south-east Asia. “Our hypothesis is that the ‘Hobbit’ ancestors came from the north, rather than travelling eastward through Java and Bali,” said Ven Den Bergh, whose work was published in the journal Nature.“They may have been caught in a tsunami and carried out to sea. Those kinds of freak, random events are probably responsible for these movements of humans and animals. This region is tectonically active so tsunamis are common and there are big ones every hundred years or so.” The researchers unearthed tools including 49 sharp-edge flakes and two possible hammer stones, while 13 rhino bones showed signs of being hit with hammers and one was smashed entirely, possibly to get access to the edible marrow inside.Also among the remains were skeletons of a monitor lizard, Philippine brown deer, freshwater turtles and stegodons, an early incarnation of the elephant. Whether they were also on the dinner plates of the early human occupants of Luzon is still unknown."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Plastic straws among items to be banned in EU under proposed legislation from ECFuneral of mother of three Natalia Karaczyn told her death was \u0026lsquounspeakably painful\u0026rsquoDogs found in back of a van in Cairnryan ferry portSome 6,500 officers respond to PWC survey and call for more sergeants to be appointedNone of three mobile phones sought from former head of Garda Press Office recoveredAre you struggling to rent a house?

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3481984.1525297392!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"house of lords backs move to prevent hard border","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Northern Ireland David Trimble:   said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London. Photograph: Matthew LloydGetty ImagesBritain’s House of Lords has backed a move to prevent a hard border after Brexit under which no new checks or controls could be imposed without the agreement of the Irish Government. Peers voted by 309 to 242 in favour of the amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, which was proposed by former Conservative minister and EU commissioner Chris Patten. It says Brexit must not diminish any form of North-South co-operation or create or facilitate Border arrangements featuring any new infrastructure, checks or controls without an agreement between London and Dublin. Lord Patten said the amendment reflected prime minister Theresa May’s stated policy, which was under pressure from hardline Brexiteers, and he rejected the charge that raising fears about a hard border was playing with fire.“I will tell you what I think playing with fire is: blundering into the politics of Northern Ireland with a policy which is sometimes clueless and sometimes delinquent with a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. That is playing with fire. That is what we are in danger of doing,” he said.Former first minister David Trimble was one of a number of former unionist politicians to speak against the amendment, suggesting that Brussels and Dublin were seeking to change the way Northern Ireland was governed.“The drive is there to get Northern Ireland into a special situation: linked permanently to the European Union and with the union with the rest of the United Kingdom to that extent weakened,” he said.Lord Trimble said Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney had damaged relations between Dublin and London, which had improved dramatically since the Good Friday Agreement.“They have been extremely good and I am delighted, but the behaviour at the moment of the Irish prime minister and Coveney, backed up by the European Union, is actually destroying that relationship and doing considerable damage to it,” he said.Wednesday night’s vote, in which 19 Conservative peers supported the amendment, was the 10th defeat the Lords have inflicted on the government during the passage of the EU Withdrawal Bill.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

10000","story":"Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano has erupted, causing lava to spew out of cracks in the ground in residential areas and prompting thousands of people to flee.The Pacific island state\u0027s governor signed an emergency proclamation releasing disaster funds to the Big Island in the eruption\u0027s wake.Local news footage showed streams of lava snaking through a forest and authorities reported steam and lava emissions from a crack in Leilani Subision in the area of Mohala Street following the blast.Residents of that impacted area, some 1,700 people, were under mandatory evacuation after the burst from Kilauea, one of the most active volcanos in the world.In addition to the obligatory evacuations, many areas fell under voluntary evacuation zones, affecting some 10,000 people, according to a local official.A plume of ash rises from the Puu Oo vent on Hawaii\u0026#39s Kilaueaa volcano US Geological Survey authorities of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory unit were both on the ground and headed into the air to assess the eruption.It followed some 100 small earthquakes in recent days and began around 4.45 pm local time (2.45am GMT Friday), according to the agency.Earlier, at 10.30 am, a larger 5.0-magnitude earthquake south of the Puu Oo volcano cone triggered rockfalls and potential collapse into a crater on the volcano, according to USGS.Lava overflows from the crater rimBig Island resident Janice Wei said she felt a big shake underneath my feet and then said immediately after she saw a giant pink plume of smoke.We\u0027ve been waiting for big movement from the crater, after so many small earthquakes, she added.Using his drone, resident Jeremiah Osuna captured video footage of the red-hot lava flow, describing it as a curtain of fire.It sounded like if you were to put a bunch of rocks into a dryer and turn it on as high as you could, he told Honolulu television station KOHN.Following the eruption authorities warned of subsequent lava inundation, fire, smoke, and additional earthquakes.The agency said those downwind of the dissipating plume may experience a dusting of ash, warning of potentially lethal concentrations of sulfur dioxide gas in the zone as well as methane blasts that could propel large rocks and debris in adjacent areas.Governor David Ige activated the archipelago state\u0027s National Guard troops, and told residents to pay heed to warnings.Please be alert and prepare now to keep your family safe, Ige wrote on Twitter.Local community centers were open to residents impacted by the threat, Hawaii\u0027s emergency management agency said.The USGS had raised the volcano alert in the area from a watch to a warning, reporting that new ground cracks were discovered in the late afternoon.White, hot vapor and blue fume emanated from an area of cracking in the eastern part of the subision, the agency wrote.It emphasised that the early stages of fissure eruptions are dynamic, and additional vents and new lava outbreaks may occur.At this time it is not possible to say where new vents could happen, it said.The affected area is part of the Big Island\u0027s East Rift Zone, in which the Hawaii Volcano Observatory had identified magma movement and warned residents that seismic activities and eruptions could take place without notice.All areas bordering East Rift Zone at high risk for eruption, Hawaii County\u0027s mayor Harry Kim said on Twitter.US Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) was mobilising resources, as well as monitoring for forest fires, power outages and water supply issues.Hawaii Island, or the Big Island, is the largest of the eight main islands that comprise the Pacific US state, an archipelago that includes hundreds of smaller volcanic islands.Wei, who moved to Hawaii from California - known for its high earthquake risk - said the eruption was almost a relief.People live here - the Hawaiians and local people have lived here forever, she said. You know what\u0027s going on we have warning systems. Everybody should be prepared.An ash plume rises above the Kilauea volcano on Hawaii\u0026#39s Big Island Most of Kilauea\u0027s activity has been non-explosive, but a 1924 eruption belched ash and 10-ton rocks into the sky, leaving one man dead.Puu Oo\u0027s 1983 eruption resulted in lava fountains soaring more than 1,500 feet high.In the decades since, the lava flow has buried dozens of square miles (kilometers) of land and destroyed many homes. Please review our commenting policyHow popular is Donald Trump?

The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. Thousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.Most breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.A record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued.

The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.\u0026#13Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete.

The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.The majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicideScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in GermanyA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightenedScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memoriesThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other wayScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.A new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. Having lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment.

Photos of the happy couple are strewn around the walls: Jane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris Jane and Serge beaming into the camera on a lazy summer’s day, after a long, languid lunch. Jane looks beautiful, an English rose, the epitome of a carefree era when anything seemed possible. Serge looks incroyable, like a gargoyle or a goblin. No wonder the French press called him l’homme à tête de chou (the man with the head of a cabbage).From 1968 to 1980, Birkin and Gainsbourg were Europe’s most glamorous creative couple. They could scarcely have been less alike. She was young and lovely, health and innocence personified. He was seedy and dishevelled, yet he oozed Gallic élan. They appeared together in movies and fashion shoots, but the thing that made them famous was the song they sang together, “Je T’Aime… Moi Non Plus” (I love you… neither do I).Gasinbourg wrote “Je T’Aime” for Brigitte Bardot, with whom he had a brief romance in 1967. In 1969, he released the song with his new love, Jane Birkin. It was a Succès de Scandale, on account of Birkin’s contribution, in which she simulated the sounds of female arousal (20 years before When Harry Met Sally – quelle horreur!). If you’ve never heard it, it sounds awful – but, remarkably, it was a masterpiece. A conversation between two passionate, nihilistic lovers, it contained poetic pearls like “You are the wave – I am the island”, and Birkin’s heavy breathing, of course.Driving through Oxfordshire, on the road to Blenheim Palace in 1969“Je T’Aime” was condemned by the Vatican and banned from the radio in Britain and several Continental countries. France was a bit more enlightened. The song was played on the radio, but only after 11pm, and you had to be over 21 to buy the record. Even then, it was sold in a plain wrapper, like a porn mag or a blue movie. Naturally, this furore was wonderful exposure. A broadcast ban is fantastic for sales, giving a hit single a rebellious cachet that no amount of advertising can achieve. All these years later, “Je T’Aime” still stands proud in the pantheon of brilliant records banned by the BBC, from “God Save the Queen” by the Sex Pistols to “Relax” by Frankie Goes to Hollywood.  The record reached number one in Britain, and all across the Continent. Serge told Jane that the Pope was their greatest PR man. “He loved it!” she says, remembering Gainsbourg’s reaction to the controversy. He had a terrific appetite for mischief, and he knew no publicity was bad publicity.Jane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane \u0026amp Serge: Family album by Andrew BirkinJane and Serge kissing in the back seat of a car on a rainy day in Paris 1969 - Andrew Birkin: Serge seemed to know the hidden underside of the photo shoot and, clearly better than me, the readers of Jours de France: nothing too subtle. We looked for the Oxford bus depot, which was deserted at the weekend, and bribed the caretaker to close his eyes while Serge sat in the driver\u0027s seat in the bright red double-decker bus, Jane at his side. Buying him a hot dog was the not-too-subtle but sufficient reward, before setting off for Oxford, a true place of learning.\u0026#131974 - Andrew Birkin: Serge received some good news from his agent... and bad news in a Sunday rag, which quoted him as saying: You\u0027re not my wife, darling... I love my freedom too much! . Black had always been my favourite colour: when I was at school, I had painted my bedroom walls black and I thought about doing the same in this hideous house I had bought in London. Serge stole a march on me by covering his recently purchased house in the Rue de Verneuil in black from floor to ceiling. \u0026#13On the road to Blenheim PalaceSerge entertaining Jane and Régine during a lunch party in 1969Photography by Andrew BirkinJane in 19691977 - Andrew Birkin: Jane had bought an old presbytery in Normandy, somewhere she could impose her own taste rather than always approving Serge\u0027s style. Serge\u0027s love for the countryside was short-lived and after just a few days, he was itching with the idea of returning to Paris... Or at least the idea of reviving himself with a “Marcel Proust” cocktail at the bar in the Grand Hôtel in Cabourg. \u0026#13Serge and Nana in 1977That was nearly 50 years ago, but the memories of that hedonistic era still burn bright, and now Birkin is revisiting that heady époque in a new show called Jane \u0026amp Serge here in Calais. It’s an exhibition of photos of the couple by her brother, Andrew Birkin, taken from the late Sixties to the late Seventies. Andrew is an eminent filmmaker (his biggest hit was his haunting film of Ian McEwan’s novel, The Cement Garden) and he has a director’s eye for drama. Andrew has always been close to Jane and he became close to Gainsbourg too. Consequently, these photos are incredibly intimate. Each frame preserves a particular mood, a unique atmosphere. They not only capture the essence of their relationship but the spirit of their age.Andrew is here too, for the opening of the exhibition, and he takes time out to show me and a few other hacks around. “He was a provocateur,” he says, of Serge. “He was always on.” This isn’t a criticism, merely a statement of fact. Twenty-seven years since Gainsbourg died, of a heart attack, aged just 62, Andrew’s deep affection for the legendary chanteur endures. “That streak of melancholy was one of his most attractive facets.”Half a century later, Jane Birkin is still striking – the same fine features half hidden beneath a cascade of tousled brown hair. The laugh lines around her almond eyes merely add to her allure, and her rich voice is full of joie de vivre. Although she left Gainsbourg in 1980, on account of his escalating alcoholism, they remained friends thereafter, united by the child they had together, the actress and singer Charlotte Gainsbourg, and she speaks of him with fondness, and admiration.Jane in the grounds of Blenheim Palace in 1969 – the archetypal English rose“Andrew was around on all our holidays – and all the rather bad films I did!” she recalls, looking at the photos of her younger self that surround her, reducing her to a pale replica of the image on the wall. “It’s a bit weird. You feel as if you’re dead.” Everyone laughs, but it’s not so funny. Her youthful fame has eclipsed her, leaving her public persona stranded in a time that’s long since passed.She still spends most of her time in France, and today she seems more French than English. Watching her being interviewed by French reporters, speaking fluent French, she seems more natural, more at ease. It looks like an admirable life, from a distance, but she’s had her share of sadness. Kate Barry, her eldest daughter, from her first marriage to the composer John Barry, died in Paris in 2013 after falling from a fourth-floor apartment.Jane left Serge for the French director Jacques Doillon, with whom she had another daughter, the actress and singer-songwriter Lou Doillon. She still sings, and last year she released an album of songs written for her by Serge – he wrote some of his finest songs about her after they’d parted. “Which, for me, are the most beautiful,” she says. “Everything on Baby Alone in Babylone, which was perhaps the best record I ever made.”That was two years after they’d split, and she’d already given birth to Lou, but the aura of their romance lived on in Serge’s songs. “I liked the ones after I left more, perhaps, because they were really about what he was feeling, and I felt it was deeper.” It felt emotional, singing them in front of him after a parting which caused them both such pain.What made him so significant as an artiste, I ask her. “He really rediscovered the French language,” she tells me. “That’s why I think every writer these days is bound to mention his name.” She likens him to Picasso, passing through so many styles. “He never repeated himself.”Jane and Serge in 1977, in the old presbytery that she bought in NormandyLike a true poet, he loved ambiguity. “There were always two meanings, and sometimes a third.” Yet he far preferred to simply call himself a songwriter. “He didn’t want to say he was a poet. He thought that was for Baudelaire and Apollinaire. The people he really appreciated were classical musicians.” He said that songwriting was a minor occupation. She found such modesty refreshing.Time’s up. Jane has another appointment. A French TV crew are waiting. I return to Andrew and his photos. “The problem with photography is that it starts to overwrite your memories of what you didn’t photograph,” he says. I think I know what he means. The more you look at these photos of his sister, the more unreal the real person becomes.Jane Birkin asks Hermès fashion house to rename luxury Birkin bagsSimon Price on Jane Birkin: Jane reignites her flame for SergeJane Birkin: \u0027I was no Lolita,\u0027 says Britain\u0027s BardotHowever Andrew has a very clear memory of his final meeting with Serge Gainsbourg, about six months before he died. “I bought him a 1910 bottle of Absinthe from Sotheby’s.” Andrew went to see him in his home in Paris, and they watched a film together. “He was asleep within five minutes of putting on the video, so I got up, crept out of the black house and into the black street and that was the last time I saw him.”In the end, it was the same old, sad old story. “The main problem with Serge is just that he became an alcoholic, and had no particular interest in stopping himself.” So what was the connection between his sister and the chanteur? I ask him. “Sex,” he says, and everyone laughs, but he then stops and thinks about it. “It was the attraction of opposites, in a way.”Jane \u0026amp Serge is at the Musée des Beaux Arts in Calais (calais.fr) until 4 Novemberor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

However, animals were not the only threat. Kenya was at the time a British colony.During the Mau Mau uprising of the 1950s, white families were fair game to the rebels thanks in no small part to the brutal nature of colonial rule. (In 2011 William Hague expressed “sincere regret” for the thousands who had been detained and tortured.) When Sheldrick was nine months pregnant she survived an ambush by Mau Mau fighters.Chained and tortured: The horror inflicted on India’s elephantsSo when a wild elephant she had mistaken for one of her hand-reared orphans turned on her in 1994, she took it in her stride.“I opened my eyes. I could feel the elephant gently insert her tusks between my body and the rocks,” she wrote in her autobiography, Love, Life and Elephants: An African Love Story, in 2012.“Rather than a desire to kill, I realised that the elephant was actually trying to help me,” she added. “I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to Kenya.”Born Daphne Marjorie Jenkins, Sheldrick came from a family of settlers who left rural Scotland for Africa in the mid-1820s. Her great-uncle Will, a successful farmer in South Africa, began the family’s connection with Kenya after meeting governor Sir Charles Eliot. Eliot was offering free land to families prepared to move to his new colony. Among the families that subsequently boarded the boat to Mombasa were Daphne Sheldrick’s great-grandparents.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)The settlers arrived to an uncertain future in a country with none of the comforts of home. They could not move their livestock inland without first swathing them in cloth to foil the tsetse fly. The new railway was notorious for the number of workers eaten by lions during its construction. And the 5,000 acres of virgin bush gifted by the British government were in fact already home to the Masai. After an arduous four-month journey to get there, Sheldrick’s family had to move on again.I knew then and there that I had an absolute duty to pass on my intimate knowledge and understanding of Africa’s wild animals and my belonging to KenyaBy the time Sheldrick was born, third of Bryan and Marjorie Jenkin’s four children, the family was established on a farm in Gilgil in the Great Rift Valley. Marjorie Jenkins was determined to instil in her children a love for the natural world. Family walks included not just the farm dogs but an impala, a waterbuck and Rikki-Tikki-Tavi, a brown-furred dwarf mongoose. At the age of four, Sheldrick was given responsibility for the care of an orphaned infant bushbuck.It was an idyllic upbringing but it was hard to run a European farm among African predators such as lions and leopards. At the same time, the global picture was changing rapidly. With the Second World War reaching Ethiopia, the British government looked to Kenya to feed the troops. Bryan Jenkins was tasked with shooting thousands of wildebeest and zebra in the Southern Game Reserve. He set up a portable biltong factory, assisted by two Italian prisoners of war. It was while camping nearby that six-year-old Sheldrick was woken by lions. Attracted by the smell of meat, they stayed to lick salt from the tarpaulins.The author’s work on the Ban the Bloody Ivory campaign drew in stars including Joanna Lumley (front, centre) (Rex)As soon as she was old enough, Sheldrick, who could speak Swahili, was sent to boarding school. She was a keen student, graduating eighth in her year and winning a university bursary. However, she was already in love with Bill Woodley, a student from her brother’s school, and chose instead to leave full-time education to be with him.Khurshid Drabu: Britain’s first Muslim judgeRemembering Avicii, Swedish superstar of electronic dance musicLeila Abashidze: Georgian actress who became a star of Soviet cinemaJanka Nabay: Musician who brought Sierra Leone’s bubu to the worldIsao Takahata: Japanese animation master who co-founded Studio GhibliAt around the same time, a state of emergency was declared in Kenya after Mau Mau guerrilla fighters, drawn from the Kikuyu, Meru, Embu, Kamba and Masai people, rose up against white colonial rule. The insurgency was put down with shocking brutality by British colonial officials and Kenyan “home guards”. Thousands of civilians were rounded up in mass detention camps and subjected to beatings, sexual assault and even castration, allegedly sanctioned at the highest level. (Finally, in 2013, after a long legal campaign, the British government apologised.)Mau Mau retaliation was equally bloody and Sheldrick’s family did not escape the violence. During a Mau Mau raid on her great-aunt’s farm, five people, including three children, were burned alive. Sheldrick’s grandparents were beaten and left for dead in an alleged Mau Mau robbery. Meanwhile, a worker on the Jenkins’ farm wasted away and died, convinced he was cursed after refusing to kill his employers at the Mau Mau’s behest.The David Sheldrick Trust has been reintroducing orphans back into the wild at Tsavo National Park since 1987 (Rex)In the midst of this unrest, Sheldrick married Woodley, visiting the United Kingdom for the first time on their honeymoon. After their marriage they moved to Tsavo National Park, where they worked as wardens. In January 1955, Bill took the now heavily pregnant Sheldrick back to visit her family in Gilgil. Returning in darkness, they were ambushed. “A terrifyingly loud sound erupted and in the arc of the headlamps we could see crazed, menacing figures, clad in skins, coming towards us in a great swirl of anger and noise. Some were wielding pangas, some were hurling enormous boulders and others were firing at us from point blank range.”Sheldrick continued working into later life (Rex)Bill Woodley saved his wife and unborn daughter, Jill, by driving straight through the Mau Mau attackers. A year later, the capture of Mau Mau leader Dedan Kimathi marked the official end of the “Emergency”, but the rebellion continued underground for almost a decade.The Woodleys survived the ambush but soon after their marriage foundered. Sheldrick, still Mrs Woodley as she then was, had fallen hopelessly in love with her husband’s boss with whom she had much in common. David Sheldrick was a keen naturalist dedicated to ending poaching. During his anti-poaching campaign, more than 25,700lbs of ivory was recovered and in 1959 and he was duly awarded an MBE. Meanwhile, Bill Woodley’s passion for hunting, so much at odds with his role as warden, was beginning to grate. Sheldrick left him for his high-minded superior.Sheldrick married David in 1960. Their family quickly expanded to encompass a variety of furry and feathered orphans, such as Gregory Peck, a buffalo weaver-bird, and Old Spice, a civet cat with a passion for the aftershave that bore his name. Soon after came a human daughter, Angela.We had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world warsDavid Sheldrick had already raised two orphaned elephants, Samson and Fatuma. His observations of the pair formed some of the first studies on elephant diet and migration. Daphne Sheldrick took charge of further orphans including one she named Aisha. In an interview, Sheldrick explained: “She came to us as one of the smallest elephants I had ever seen, with soft fuzz and ears as soft and pink as petals. When she arrived, my heart plummeted as we had never been able to save an elephant this young.”The Sheldricks had already discovered that elephants do not thrive on traditional baby formula and after a few days on glucose and watered down cow’s milk, Aisha was wasting away. As a last resort, Sheldrick tried coconut oil. It worked. Aisha began to thrive on Sheldrick’s recipe and the future of many more orphaned elephants was assured.Sheldrick leaves two daughters, four grandchildren, and a huge family of elephants, rhinos and many more (DSWT)By the early Sixties, the Mau Mau Uprising may have been over but the “winds of change”, as referenced in Harold Macmillan’s 1960 speech in South Africa, were blowing across the continent. When it came to Kenya, the British government decided that continuing colonial rule required more force than they were prepared to expend and Kenya was granted independence in 1963. The Duke of Edinburgh presided over the handover to Jomo Kenyatta.They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate thatThe change of rule caused much anguish for the white settler families, who, as Sheldrick described, “had come to Kenya as children of pioneering families who had lived through difficult times as their parents struggled to farm the land, and when grown had served Britain with distinction in its world wars. Britain began to turn its back on those people – even the daily BBC programme previously announced as ‘Home News from Britain’ became ‘News From Britain’, a subtle change that did not go unnoticed.”Sheldrick’s husband was among those who struggled to renew his British passport at the time. David Sheldrick put the situation succinctly: “There was no question about me not being British when the Second World War broke out and I was called up to fight for your bloody country.”In 2016 Sheldrick warned that if the ivory trade continued, the African forest elephant could be extinct by 2025 (Rex)The Sheldricks worried that the transition to independence would adversely affect Kenya’s national parks but it was their success in making the park a safe haven for elephants that caused the next problem. The elephant numbers at Tsavo had grown dramatically – from an estimated 5,000 to 15,000 – and the increased competition for food led to the devastation of much of the forest landscape. However, David Sheldrick firmly resisted the idea of an artificial cull and, in time, the more open grasslands created by the elephants’ indiscriminate browsing attracted new species, including antelope and buffalo. The Tsavo lions thrived.Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn tradeIn 1976, the parks were finally brought under government control, merging with the Government Game Department. Sheldrick explained that for the park’s “wild inhabitants, especially rhinos and elephants, who became instant targets, it was the death knell”. Shortly afterwards, David Sheldrick was offered a desk job in Nairobi and the family left Tsavo to an uncertain fate.David Sheldrick died that same year. After his death, devastated Sheldrick began to raise funds in his memory to continue the work that meant so much to him.‘Born to be Wild’, narrated by Morgan Freeman, shone a spotlight on the rehabilitation efforts in Kenya (Getty)The first official fundraiser was a film by former warden Simon Trevor. Somali gangs, armed with AK47s, had been gunning down entire Tsavo elephant herds, turning the park into a no-go zone. Trevor’s film on the crisis, Bloody Ivory, came to the attention of President Arap Moi, who agreed to attend the premiere. Alas, Moi was a no-show, but a few months later the Vatican proposed a papal visit to Kenya, during which the pope wished to bless an elephant and a rhino calf. Sheldrick obliged. The logistics were difficult but the publicity was priceless.Sheldrick was named one of the most significant conservationists ever (DSWT)In 1987, the David Sheldrick Memorial appeal became The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust (DSWT), with a mission statement declaring it “embraces all measures that compliment the conservation, preservation and protection of wildlife”. Over the next 30 years the trust expanded to three sites: the elephant nursery at Sheldrick’s home in Nairobi, and two centres in Tsavo where the orphans were reintroduced into the wild.There was no shortage of infant elephants to be reared. Though President Moi tried to signal an end to the ivory trade by publicly burning Kenya’s stockpile in 1989, the international appetite for ivory remained undiminished. Between 2003 and 2013, the DSWT saw a 500 per cent increase in the number of orphans rescued, driven by demand for ivory from China. In an interview in 2016, Sheldrick lamented that elephants were being killed at a rate of 50 a day, telling Bohotraveller: “Money, corruption, greed and ignorance motivates the evil ivory and rhino horn trade.”UK ivory trade ban a positive step but what next for Africa’s elephantConservationists warn its too early to celebrate elephants\u0027 safetyEurope must choose: elephants or ivoryYoung Kenyans care for nature but are detached from conservation Wildlife conservancy grows cattle feed to fend off droughtFamily of elephant conservation pioneer pledge her legacy will live onSheldrick spread the word about the crisis facing the elephants with numerous television appearances. She published four books, including her autobiography. Meanwhile, her work was recognised all over the world. In 1989, she was appointed MBE. She was awarded an honorary doctorate in veterinary medicine by Glasgow University. In 2001, the Kenyan government awarded her the Moran of the Burning Spear and in 2006 Sheldrick became a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, “for services to the conservation of wildlife, especially elephants, and to the local community in Kenya”. Her knighthood was the first to be awarded in Kenya since the country’s independence in 1963, something that Sheldrick said “left me dumbfounded but nevertheless extremely proud”. At the time of Sheldrick’s death in April 2018, the DSWT hand-reared more than 200 orphaned elephants, more than 100 of whom were successfully released into the wild. As the trust approached its 40th anniversary last year, Sheldrick told Eluxe magazine: “I have always turned to the elephants for inspiration in the face of adversity. They suffer loss and heartbreak on an almost daily basis, they grieve and mourn the loss of loved ones just as deeply as us, but they turn the page to focus on the living, and I try to emulate that.”As Sheldrick wrote in her autobiography: “Elephants are, indeed, just like us, and in many ways better.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13The department’s top civil servants acknowledged the fear of some “clunky fixes” and that some functions would not be performed “as slickly as they are at the moment”. Both problems would arise if the government fails to secure an exit deal, or that deal is rejected by parliament, and it carries out its “no deal” exit threat.The committee demanded an update from Defra by next month, “in case negotiations break down”.“Given its poor track record on IT delivery, Defra must ensure it has the necessary resources in place to complete its IT programmes on time and avoid costly and embarrassing contingencies involving manual completion and submission of forms,” it said.Ms Hillier added: “Departments are under extreme pressure.

DIT, formed in direct response to the EU referendum result, has mission-critical responsibilities. All departments have much to do.”The report also criticised the Treasury for failing to set out, until March, how much funding each department would receive in 2018-19 to prepare for Brexit.It eventually announced that Defra would be allocated £310m and Dit £74m, out of a total pot of £1.6bn.Department for Environmental Food \u0026 Rural Affairsor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Labour leadership and people around them have seen the signs for a long time and they have not acted.Mr Langleben called for Jeremy Corbyn to visit Barnet and apologise to the Jewish community.Thanks to all those who voted for myself, Humayune and Agnes today. It was the greatest honour of my life to serve West Hendon.I don\u0027t think I have ever felt more proud to live in Barnet. An area where race hate is punished by voters. https:t.coXYK5gNqsx9Labour group leader Barry Rawlings said: I must say that in some wards where there is a large Jewish community, it has made a difference.Of course the Tories did go hard in those areas on that issue, saying that if you vote Labour you\u0027re voting for Jeremy Corbyn, added Mr Rawlings.\u0027But to be honest most of the conversations have been about potholes rather than antisemitism. That said, we want people to know it is an issue we take very seriously in the Labour Party.Council leader Richard Cornelius, a Conservative councillor, also said voters were generally more concerned about local issues rather than accusations of antisemitism within Labour.It\u0027s things like potholes, the collection of their rubbish bins and keeping the council tax low, he said.Of course there is a concern about anti-Semitism in the Jewish areas, and of course there is a wider concern about more generally - people are horrified, and Labour have to address that.It\u0027s been very close.Local elections 2018 – in picturesLocal elections 2018 – in picturesJeremy Corbyn outside a polling station in IslingtonTheresa May and her husband Philip arrive at a polling station to vote in local elections in central LondonBoris Johnson leaves after voting in LondonLiberal Democrats leader Vince Cable with his wife Rachel at Twickenham polling station A man enters a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA man fixes a sign to the door of a polling station as voting begins in local government elections in LondonA poll clerk hangs a polling station sign outside the Victoria and Jubilee Halls in Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, some 45 miles west of LondonVoters at The Vyne polling station in Knaphill, part of the Woking borough, which is one of five councils working with the Cabinet Office to trial the use of ID in polling stationsThe Conservatives controlled Barnet from 2002 until it fell back into no overall control this March when one of their councillors, Sury Khatri, resigned.They made concerted efforts to target wards with large Jewish populations in the wake of the controversy convulsing Labour.The breakthrough came when they took a seat off Labour in Hale ward and all three from the long-time Labour stronghold of West Hendon.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Pashinyan was always a charismatic leader, they say, with unlimited energy, righteousness, and an appreciation for troublemaking.Born in the regional town of Ijevan near the north-eastern border with Azerbaijan, Mr Pashinyan moved to the capital Yerevan to study journalism in the early 1990s.He was a straight-A student, one of the brightest in the year, but he never managed to finish his degree. Officially, he was expelled for missing classes, but classmates said he had angered superiors by writing an article, published in a newspaper, alleging corruption. “He was always for the truth,” says Alina Ordyan, who studied with him at Yerevan State University. “Then and now, he believed he was right, and he had the intellect to back it up.” In the late 1990s, Pashinyan became the editor of his own newspaper, Armenian Time. As the country cascaded into authoritarianism over the next decade, his newspaper came to be known as the country’s most fearless. The transition to politics was a natural next step. He began by aligning himself alongside Levon Ter-Petrosyan – Armenia\u0027s first president, from 1991-1998 – who was again standing in the February 2008 presidential elections.Mr Ter-Petrosyan\u0027s bid was unsuccessful, and he lost to Republican Party chairman Serzh Sargsyan in a disputed vote.Pashinyan led protests against it – protests that were only dispersed violently on 1 March, culminating in 10 deaths. The former journalist was forced into hiding for several months. The shadow of 2008 has loomed large over Armenia’s latest uprising. Throughout his campaign to remove Sargsyan from government, Pashinyan has referred to the need for a proper investigation and punishment into the deaths. On 22 April, at a critical crossroads in the revolution, Sargsyan also made an ill-advised reference to the events. He warned the protest leader that he had “not learned the lessons of March 1.” People interpreted that thinly-veiled threat as a confession, says opposition activist Mikayel Hovhannisyan. And it was an easy rallying call.“People who had never been to a demonstration before came out on street only because of that sentence,” he said.  Supporters of protest leader Nikol Pashinyan attend a rally in downtown Yerevan on 1 May (AFP)Later that day, a record number of protestors gathered on Yerevan’s Republic Square.Pashinyan, two fellow opposition MPs, and 200 others were removed from the crowd and arrested. But under intense pressure, the very next day, Sargsyan relented, released them and resigned. “Nikol Pashinyan was right. I was wrong,” Sargsyan wrote in his dramatic final statement. Pashinyan, who in the space of a couple of weeks emerged as the undisputed leader of the masses, pushed for the absolute capitulation of Mr Sargsyan’s party.With the power of the street behind him, he had political momentum. But on Tuesday, the ruling Republican Party pushed back by blocking his candidacy for prime minister. The protest leader responded by orchestrating a national shut-down the very next day. This seems to have quickly changed minds inside the ruling party. Leading figures in the Republican Party were already conceding defeat when contacted by The Independent on Wednesday morning. One of Pashinyan’s leading critics, Armen Ashotyan, vice chair of the Republican Party, contended that it would have been “political hypocrisy” to have supported Mr Pashinyan’s candidacy in his initial bid.Yet, they will now back him, he said, at the second vote, scheduled for this coming Tuesday – but only after “defending the institution of opposition.” Footage from the scene of a major protest in Armenia following transport shutdown“Pashinyan’s main success was choosing the right moment,” says political analyst Mikael Zolyan.His decision to begin the protest at the point where Sargsyan attempted to transition from president to prime minister was a masterstroke, he said: “He knew when to strike – in a power vacuum – and when Sargsyan could give the order to crush, it was already too late.” Pashinyan has also managed to come to power while giving little away on his actual political programme.In parliament on 1 May, the former journalist said he would not describe himself according to old isions of left and right, which “no longer worked.” World news in picturesWorld news in picturesChinese President Xi Jinping speaks at an event to mark  Karl Marx’s 200th birthday at the Great Hall of the People in BeijingPresident Vladimir Putin meets with FIFA president Gianni Infantino in Sochi, ahead of the 2018 World Cup in Russia.Supporters of opposition lawmaker Nikol Pashinyan protest in Republic Square in Yerevan, Armenia.

But yesterday he ascended to one of the great offices of state.What makes Javid’s appointment so remarkable is that Theresa May cares about the Home Office — which she was in charge of for six years — more than any other department and she and Javid have not seen eye to eye over the years.If the Prime Minister was at the peak of her powers, he would not be the new Home Secretary.When Theresa May made Amber Rudd Home Secretary, it was on the implicit understanding that she would continue her legacy at the Home Office.Rudd accepted this trade — and swallowed her own doubts about several of Mrs May’s policies.This approach was, ultimately, what did for her. Javid, a far more independent-minded politician, will not repeat that mistake.Indeed, no senior member of the Cabinet offered the job would now be prepared to make the trade that Rudd did back in 2016.Mrs May simply isn’t powerful enough to demand that kind of loyalty any more. Rudd’s departure exposes Mrs May in two ways.First, the firebreak between her and the Windrush scandal has been removed. Any further revelations about what has gone wrong will end up on the Prime Minister’s doorstep.Second, it has shown how Mrs May now has to reach out in even her most senior Cabinet appointments, promoting those who have clashed with her in the past.When the political Cabinet met for the first time after Mrs May’s Election disaster last year, Javid was ABSOLUTELY BRUTAL in setting out what was wrong with the way she and her team had run Downing Street.The Prime Minister was left in no doubt as to Javid’s frustration with how her team had undermined him.But the reason why he was briefed against is fascinating, given his new job.Javid’s offence was not to kowtow to Mrs May.At the height of the May ascendancy, when she was the most popular Prime Minister since polling records began, most ministers went along with whatever she wanted, whether they agreed with it or not. Javid did not.He argued ferociously against what he saw as her anti-business proposals.He fought particularly hard against her desire for tests for foreign takeovers of British companies.In meetings he sided with Chancellor Philip Hammond in arguing that Britain shouldn’t become like France, a country where the government stopped foreigners buying a yoghurt-making company on national interest grounds.Mrs May now finds herself presiding over a Cabinet where ministers know they can push their own positions with little consequence.So Jeremy Hunt and Gavin Williamson have both campaigned publicly for more money for health and defence respectively.Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has openly set out the kind of Brexit he wants, unafraid to get ahead of the Prime Minister’s position.David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, is now letting it be known what the differences are between his approach and that of the Prime Minister’s chief adviser on the negotiations, Olly Robbins.If Javid was prepared to stand up to Mrs May at the height of her powers, what will he do now?He certainly won’t be her patsy at the Home Office. He’ll be determined to put his own stamp on the department.A more ruthless politician than Amber Rudd, he won’t feel any compunction about breaking from the Prime Minister’s Home Office legacy where necessary.Why, then, has Mrs May appointed him?Well, I understand her initial instinct was to consider Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland Secretary, for the job.Bradley is a May loyalist: She was one of her junior ministers at the Home Office, an enthusiastic backer of her leadership bid and is her most reliable ally in the Brexit inner Cabinet.However, senior figures at No10 persuaded the Prime Minister that appointing Bradley would look like she was circling the wagons — that it would project an image of weakness, not strength.With a growing feeling among the Cabinet that Mrs May has retreated into the Downing Street bunker, listening more and more to officials such as Olly Robbins and less and less to ministers, appointing a cipher to be Home Secretary would have caused dangerous levels of anger and resentment. Mrs May, to her credit, listened and the decision to appoint Javid was made.His instincts on immigration are different from Mrs May’s.He doesn’t regard it as a numbers game and is one of the Cabinet ministers most privately sceptical of the PM’s aim to reduce immigration to the tens of thousands.If Mrs May was in a stronger position, she would have appointed someone more prepared to defer to her views on this subject than him.Javid will be his own man as Home Secretary, not the Prime Minister’s. Mrs May, who knows the Home Office so well, will find that hard to take at times.But his appointment is a recognition that she isn’t any more in a position to dictate to her senior ministers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in my view, the Appeal Court was wrong.As a lifelong campaigner for LGBT rights, and as someone with gay friends in Northern Ireland who want to marry, I obviously strongly disagree with Ashers’ opposition to marriage equality.But in a free society neither they, nor anyone else, should be compelled by law to promote an idea they object to.These bakers didn’t turn away their gay customer – they gladly agreed to make Gareth a cake but declined to decorate it with the pro-gay marriage wording he wanted.As much as I deplore their opposition to marriage equality, Ashers should not be forced to promote same-sex marriage, given that it goes against their religious beliefs - nor should they be obliged to endorse a LGBT equality movement they do not agree with.This case doesn’t just affect the LGBT community it has wider, dangerous implications for the whole of Britain.If the Supreme Court insists that the bakery should be required to promote a pro-gay rights message that they find objectionable, this would presumably also mean that a Jewish publisher could be obliged to print a book that propagates Holocaust denial.Likewise, Muslim publishers (who believe that the Islamic prophet must never be depicted in art or drawings) could be legally pressured, against their will, to print the Danish cartoons of Mohammed that Muslims find deeply offensive.It could also encourage far right extremists to demand that businesses facilitate the promotion of their anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim opinions.Although most Christians in Britain now support same-sex civil marriage in register offices, the McArthur family, which owns Ashers bakery, does not.They say their faith requires them to oppose gay marriage and anything that endorses it.Using the law to force Ashers and others to aid the dissemination of ideas that conflict with their conscience sets a dangerous, authoritarian precedent.The equality laws invoked in this case are intended to protect people - not ideas - against discrimination.A business providing a public service, such as a bakery, has a legal duty to do so without discrimination based on a person’s race, gender, disability, faith, age, sexuality and so on. That is right and proper.But Ashers did not discriminate against the customer, Gareth Lee, because he is gay.His sexual orientation was not an issue – it is the message he wanted on the icing that is at the heart of this sticky moral dilemma.The logical consequence of the Appeal Court’s judgement against Ashers is that businesses cannot lawfully refuse a customer’s request to propagate a message, even if it is sexist, xenophobic or anti-gay - and even if the business owners have a conscientious objection to it.This case is different from the Christian B\u0026ampB owners who refused to accommodate a same-sex couple or the town hall registrar who refused to perform a gay civil partnership.Both were offering a public service but refused to provide that service to LGBT people. The courts found that they had discriminated unlawfully.Their refusals involved direct discrimination against people because they were gay.If the law rules against the bakery it will undermine the principle of freedom of expression, which includes the right to not support ideas you disagree with.Just reverse the roles and imagine that an anti-gay rights campaigner had asked for a cake with a homophobic slogan on it.I do not believe that a gay baker, or any baker, should be legally forced to decorate a cake with a message against LGBT equality.Discrimination against people is always wrong and is rightly unlawful.But in a democracy, it’s vital that people should be free to say no when asked to spread an idea they dont agree with.If they cant, the implications are frankly terrifying.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She made the mistake of posting pictures of herself wearing a red silk Chinese dress to her high school prom.One twitter-warrior complained: My culture is NOT your goddamn prom dress. Another asked What’s the theme of your life? Ignorant”?And it was only a matter of time before Keziah was branded with the R-word! One troll asked, Was the theme of prom casual racism?Evidently, for social justice warriors, wearing clothes or costumes from another culture constitutes a crime that goes by the name of cultural appropriation.In recent times universities have become the hot-bed of the crusade against cultural appropriation.As a professor who has worked universities for many decades, I was taken aback by the speed with which a tiny group of cultural crusaders have succeed in gaining power over campus life.The rhetoric of cultural appropriation plays an important role in the performance of outrage. And everybody is at it.In some universities guidance is offered to students about what costumes they can and cannot wear on Halloween.Forget about organising a Latino themed party. On both sides of the Atlantic the wearing of sombreros by university students has been condemned as a cultural crime against Mexico.At one university, yoga classes were suspended because it might cause offence to Indians. A campaigner helpfully offered to change the title of the course to mindful stretching.Recently Oxford university decided to cancel a cannabis themed party amid concerns about cultural appropriation.Critics of this party encouraging guests to dress as pop-icons like Snoop Dogg or Shaggy claimed that the event would cause offence to minority students.Last month, students at Bristol University, who hosted a 21st birthday party themed A night at the Maharaja’s Palace, were denounced for committing a cultural crime. Critics were particularly galled by the sight of European students wearing glamorous Indian costumes.In recent years celebrities have become a favourite target of the culture police.White models and actresses, including Kim Kardashian, who wear their hair in cornrows are slammed for exploiting black culture.Iggy Azalea the Australian singer was attacked for rapping with a blaccent. Selina Gomez was crucified for wearing a bindi. Bruno Mars was accused of stealing black music.All celebrities – not just white – risk being accused of cultural appropriation.No sooner did Beyoncé appear portraying a Bollywood actress in Coldplay’s video Hymn for the Weekend, before the all too readily outraged social media warriors accused her of offending Indian culture.So what’s going on?Until recently people were delighted when those from another culture adopted their tastes and habits.Most civilisations - such as the Greeks, the Romans – praised foreigners who adopted their mode of dress, fashion, eating habits and customs.Throughout most of history the act of cultural appropriation was associated with enlightenment and progress.No one regarded hairstyles, costumes, music or indeed most cultural artefact as the sacred property of a chosen people.A civilised society is open to different cultural influences and is ready to share its own culture with others.Sadly, current crusade against appropriation turns every form of cultural interaction into a potential site for conflict.Even food has become the target of the culture police. Students no longer simply moan about the quality of food dished out in their canteens.At Pembroke College in Cambridge University, students condemned their institution for serving “culturally insensitive food” with “inauthentic combinations of ingredients”.Elsewhere complaints have been made about cooking fried chicken, Vietnamese sandwiches and sushi in a culturally inappropriate manner.Unwittingly the crusade against cultural appropriation serves to undermine the genuine multicultural impulses in our society.The policing of culture turns different cultural experience into no-go areas.Its ultimate objective is to build cultural fences and distance different people and ethnic groups from one another.Worse still, the policing of cultures creates a climate where the free and open attitude towards how people live their lives, decide what clothes they wear or what kind of hair-style they adopt becomes a highly charged political issue.If allowed to go unchecked, this horrible crusade will lead to cultural segregation.It will create a climate of hostility and suspicion were conflicts over who gets to decide what you can eat or wear becomes the new normal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres the lowdown on the predictions and which were correct.Around 42 per cent of the seats being contested this year are in London, where all 32 boroughs have elections.Pollsters say London is now a Labour city with large numbers of young people and ethnic minorities.One borough Labour will be hoping to nick from the Tories is Kensington and Chelsea, where council leaders faced fury over the Grenfell Tower disaster.However the Tories have a 24-seat majority so a huge swing would be required for the authority to change hands.Labour also targeted Barnet - which has been Tory since the 1960s - as well as Conservative strongholds Westminster and Wandsworth, and will hope to extend majorities in other boroughs they already hold.But results revealed Labour have failed to take Barnet, Wandsworth and Westminster from the Conservatives, but they have gained Plymouth.The Lib Dems kept hold of Sutton, their last London council, and managed to snatch Richmond-upon-Thames.Outside London, Labour is defending 75 councils and aims to gain control of more in towns and cities across England.That will be a key test of national opinion after Jeremy Corbyns surprisingly strong result in the 2017 general election.Ones to watch out for include Amber Valley, Trafford, Swindon and Tamworth which are all narrowly held by the Conservatives.This morning Trafford turned red as the Conservatives lost their narrow majority but they held their majority on the other three councils.Labour is also targeting councils currently under no overall control including Stockport, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Dudley, Walsall and North-East Lincolnshire.Stockport, Dudley, Walsall, and North East Lincolnshire have remained as councils with no overall control with Newcastle-under-Lyme sill yet to declare.The demise of Ukip as a political force gives the Conservatives hope of making gains in areas that backed Brexit.The Tories are seven short of a majority in unpredictable Thurrock, where 17 Ukip councillors all quit the party and are standing as independents.Theresa Mays party also targeted Basildon, Colchester, Pendle and Portsmouth, where they lost control after a by-election last year.Basildon turned blue but Colchester and Portsmouth are still councils with no overall control. Pendle is expected to declare this afternoon.In London, Labour is on course for the best results by any party for 40 years, according to the latest YouGov survey for Queen Mary University of London.In Westminster the YouGov survey for The Times on May 2 showed 42 per cent of residents intend to vote for the Conservatives, 4 per cent more than those preparing to vote Labour.Jeremy Corbyns party has slipped three points since February but still leads the Conservatives by 51 per cent to 29 per cent.However Labour already dominate in London councils after large gains in 2014 and it is uncertain if the 22-point lead will be enough for them to snatch their target councils.They are forecast to remain runners-up in Westminster and Wandsworth.The stats predict a win in Tory stronghold Barnet, as a large Jewish population could reject Labour over the anti-Semitism scandal.Election expert Professor John Curtice said Theresa May could be spared humiliation as Brexit-led gains elsewhere in the country balance a drubbing in the capital.He said the Tories could pick up councils in key Leave-voting areas such as Peterborough, Rugby, Basildon and Pendle.Prof Curtice was proved correct with his prediction for Basildon and Peterborough as both turned blue last. Pendle is yet to declare and Rugby stayed Conservative.He said: “Don’t be surprised if projected national vote share (based on Thursday’s results) has Tories ahead even if they have lost more seats in London.”In 2014 Labour, then led by Ed Miliband, gained 200 councillors and six councils, meaning they have more to lose and gains will be more difficult.Party elections boss Andrew Gwynne has admitted they wont get the massive boost that had been predicted until recently.This year some areas will see the first trials of councils requiring voters to show ID before casting their ballot.Scotland Yard is investigating 65 allegations of voting corruption in London, The Sun revealed."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jh-graphic-p10-eu.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"we dont need a customs union","story":"Behind closed doors in government and Parliament, two fierce battles are raging, and both are about Britain’s future trading relationships with the EU and the rest of the world.The first is about the decision ministers must make on the future customs relationship we establish with Europe after Brexit. The second is an attempt by MPs and peers — regardless of what ministers decide — to impose on the Government the very solution Theresa May has already rejected: they want Britain to form a customs union with the European Union.At first, this might sound appealing. It would mean no tariffs on goods traded between Britain and the EU, no routine customs checks at the border, and less hassle for firms doing business in Europe. But there are significant downsides. We would stay tied to the EU, because a customs union would mean having to sign up to European rules and regulations, over which we would have no say.And we would be unable to sign our own trade agreements with other countries, so we would not make the most of one of Brexit’s key advantages.But a customs union with the EU — when we are no longer members of the EU — brings an even bigger problem.It would allow the European Commission, in its own negotiations, to give away trading access to Britain without getting the same access to other countries for our firms.This is what they do to ­Turkey, which is the only big country to agree even a partial customs union with Europe. The Turks are not allowed to negotiate trade agreements with other countries unless the EU has reached its own deal first.European negotiators surrender access to the Turkish ­market, but do not even try to win market access for Turkish companies. When Turkey tries to conclude its own deals, it has nothing to rely on but the generosity of the other side.Other than Turkey, the only country outside the EU to form a customs union with it is Monaco: whose population would fill less than half of Wembley ­Stadium.Not even countries like Switzerland, with its close relationship with the EU, and Norway, which is a member of the EU’s single market, are in a customs union with the EU.This is because they know what a bad deal it would be for them.It would be a bad deal for Britain, too. And as ministers have always said, “no deal is better than a bad deal.” They need, therefore, to face down the rebels in Parliament, and tell Brussels we do not seek a customs union.To do that, the Government first needs to decide its own preferred customs policy. So far, ministers have floated two proposals. Both would run alongside a free trade agreement, which would guarantee zero tariffs and mutual recognition of standards for trade between Britain and Europe.The first proposal is a “highly streamlined customs arrangement”, which would involve some customs checks between Britain and the EU, but use technology and policy solutions to make trade as smooth as possible.The second is a “new customs partnership”, which would see Britain effectively act as the EU’s external border, running dual customs checks for goods bound for Britain and the EU.This second proposal was a creative way to reimagine the way customs checks operate. But after months of scrutiny, it seems unlikely to work. The EU has dismissed it as impossible, and it involves significant risks for Britain.It would almost certainly require “full regulatory alignment” with the EU, meaning that after Brexit we could not change our laws and regulations in a long list of ways. It would create a bureaucratic burden on businesses and some may choose to use higher EU tariffs, or avoid importing and exporting altogether.And, because of the need for alignment with EU regulations and the complexity of dual customs checks, it would be much harder to negotiate trade deals with other countries.So today, when Theresa May chairs her Brexit Cabinet Committee meeting, she should lead ministers to a clear decision about the Government’s favoured customs policy.That decision should be to reject the “new customs partnership” and pursue instead the Government’s own alternative proposal: its “highly streamlined customs arrangement”.As politicians and customs experts from around Europe have said, this approach is not only workable but desirable.As Bertie Ahern, the former Irish prime minister, says, it would help avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. And it would minimise bureaucracy and limit new barriers to trade with Europe. But it would also guarantee Britain could pursue an independent trade policy and strike trade agreements with the world’s fastest- growing economies.If we are still in a customs union, however, and unable to adopt an independent trade policy, many will conclude that we have not truly left the EU. And that will have enormous political consequences.So rebel Conservative MPs need to be careful what they wish for. A partial Brexit would almost certainly see the next election fought on a need to “finish the job”. It would see the future of the Conservative Party dominated by Britain’s relationship with the EU.  And it would surely mean Theresa May’s successor will be an advocate of a clean break.That is surely not what Remainers want. For Britain to make the most of Brexit, for our new relationship with Europe to be sustainable, and for the Tories to focus on vital economic and social reforms, Brexit really must mean Brexit — ministers and MPs must reject the customs union.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a strong Conservative hold last time, but with the large number of EU remain voters living there it may become the Lib Dems second council in the country - assuming they hold on to Sutton which will be declaring almost an hour later.Also forecast to declare are Hillingdon, Reading, Walsall, Bradford, Portsmouth, Bolton, Ipswich, Slough, Wakefield, Wokingham, Daventry, Welwyn and Hatfield.5amKensington and Chelsea, the most unpredictable result in the election, is expected to be declared at 5am  - in the wake of Labours recent general election there it is thought the council may turn red.However, staunch Tory supporters in the south of the borough may help them keep the council blue despite anger over the handling of the Grenfell disaster.Ukips electoral clout will be put to the test in Thurrock which saw the party gain 17 councillors last time round - only for them all to quit en masse to form a new group denouncing party politics.Its expected to remain under Conservative control, but has had no majority party since Labour in 2012.Sutton will also be announcing their results and all eyes will be watching to see if the Lib Dems retain their only council.Also expected to declare are Bexley, Southampton, Leeds, Winchester, Brent and Cambridge.6amElection results start to quieten down with only Ealing and Derby expected to declare.Political reps will be gearing up for the final hours of TV battles and debates on breakfast television.7amCroydon, Redbridge, Camden, Southwark and Tower Hamlets are expected to declare.8amPolitical machines get whirring as voters sit down for breakfast to see Tory party chairman Brandon Lewis and Labour elections chief Andrew Gwynne battle it out on the silver screen.Its thought Merton and Greenwich will declare around 8am.Theres expected to be around 50 of the 150 councils left to declare.12pmA big break is expected between 8am and 12pm before the next lot of declarations come in.First up in the afternoon is expected to be the Lewisham and Watford mayor results and Bromley council.1pmMore counts will be in from Calderdale, Solihull, Great Yarmouth, Burnley, Gateshead, Kirklees and Milton Keynes.Also expected to be declared is the Newham mayor.2pmThe first of the metro mayors is expected to be declared in Sheffield.The councils declaring are thought to be Maidstone, Crawley, Hyndburn, Norwich, Knowsley, North Tyneside, Rossendale, Runnymead, Hounslow and Wyre Forest.3pmExpected to declare are Three Rivers, Hastings, Hackney mayor, Tunbridge Wells, Pendle, Adur, Barnsley, Craven, Harrogate, Huntingdonshrie, Mole Valley, Worthing and Cherwell.4pmStragglers are still coming through with their counts late into the afternoon - in fact theres another estimated two hours before all the councils declare.Expected to announce results are Newcastle-under-Lyme, Harrow, Harringey, Watford, Blackburn with Darwen, Elmbridge and Reigate \u0026amp Barnstead.5pmDeclaring with an hour to go until all results are expected to be in are Kingston-upon-Thames, Newham, Lewisham, South Cambridge and Woking.6pmAnd the FINAL results are in with South Lakeland, Birmingham, Manchester, Islington, Lambeth and Hackney being the last councils expected to declare.With that its all over, the political battle to gain new territory and snatch back old councils will have come to an end.We might even have an idea of what to expect when the next general election comes round in 2022. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are committed to the highest standards of food safety and clearly we’ve fallen short on this occasion.We’ve spoken to the customer to apologise and to try and put this right for her.”Nestle said they had not received any complaints, saying: If the product was sold after its best before date we would always advise a consumer to return it to the retailer for a replacement.SMA is manufactured under strict regulations and includes a number of measures to ensure safety.

They were journalists, murdered on the job as they tried to report on the details of an earlier bombing.On the same day, BBC reporter was shot dead in the countrys eastern Khost province, marking the day out as the the deadliest day for journalists since the Charlie Hebdo massacre in 2015.It makes it all the more poignant that today is World Press Freedom Day, a date to celebrate the principles of press freedom and defend reporters around the world from attacks like these.Without a free press, its impossible to hold the powerful to account, expose injustices and fight for justice on the issues affecting ordinary people.And the world would become a far more confusing place without the reporters who dedicate their lives to unearthing the truth and sharing it with us all.Compared to countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria, where journalists are routinely killed or jailed, it may seem like we have little use for Press Freedom day in the UK.But the sad truth is that there are major issues with press freedom close to home as well.Last month, Reporters Without Borders released its Press Freedom Index - a record of how free the media in each country is, based on the threat of government clampdowns and intimidation by journalists.Staggeringly, the UK came 40th out of 180 countries - worse than every other Western European nation apart from Italy.Best five countriesNotable othersWhen the index began in 2002, the UK ranked 22nd - but since then our position in the freedom league table has plummeted.This is partly due to the threats of Parliaments Data Protection Bill, which would force tougher rules on the press and give the state more power to regulate and ultimately muzzle the media.Another problem for press freedom in the UK is the general “climate of hostility towards the media”, which has seen British journalists threatened and intimidated online just for doing their job.Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor, has received so much online abuse that she was assigned her own bodyguard last year.In other countries, like Afghanistan, press freedom is under threat from bombs and bullets as well as from the government and social media.On Monday, a bomb went off during rush hour in Kabul, and journalists in the city rushed to the scene so they could cover the story.But an ISIS fighter arrived at the site of the blast with them, disguised as a reporter.He joined the crowd of journalists on the scene and detonated - hammering home the warning that an official press vest can mark reporters out as targets, rather than affording them any protection.These deaths bring the total number of journalists killed so far this year to 24.In 2017, the total stood at 82, with 13 journalists killed in Mexico, 12 in Afghanistan and 11 in Iraq - the three most dangerous places to be a journalist.The years total was the lowest tally since 2007, according to the International Federation of Journalists, but it is still 82 too many.Elsewhere in the world, journalists still face the threat of being locked up for the crime of exposing the truth.Last year, 262 journalists were arrested - the highest number in almost three decades.Turkey is the worst offender, with 73 journalists currently behind bars, while 41 journalists have been imprisoned in China and 20 in Egypt.Its a sign that, on World Press Freedom Day, we have a long way to go and hard battles to fight before journalists around the world can be free to do their jobs without fear.But today is also a day to be thankful for the brave reporters who rush selflessly into danger armed with only their cameras and notebooks.And it is a day to remember all the journalists who have already given their lives in pursuit of a story. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was more than a courtier and much more than a friend.He danced with her. He joked with her. He served her and guided her. And when her marriage hit a rocky patch, he comforted her.In her 92 years, no other man has ever been that close to the Queen, apart from Prince Philip.In 1975, when bachelor Plunket died from liver cancer aged just 51, the Queen was plunged into grief.Breaching all protocol, she ordered a royal funeral for him at St James’s Palace. Again, she broke precedent by attending his memorial service.Then she ordered that a memorial temple should be built to him in Windsor Great Park. She had a hand in its design and chose the flowers to be planted around it.Many times since Plunket’s death, when the Queen has gone to watch polo at nearby Smith’s Lawn, she has slipped away to sit, alone, beside the white-painted colonnaded temple built in her friend’s name in the park’s beautiful Valley Gardens.Nobody ever mentions these visits — nobody ever has — as the grief is too private.Such behaviour from a monarch who has spent a lifetime shielding her emotions from her subjects is unprecedented. But then, as Elizabeth was to confess herself, there was nobody to equal Patrick Plunket.They had been friends since childhood. But when Elizabeth ascended the throne in 1952, aged 25, the relationship changed . . . and deepened.Patrick’s father, Irish peer Lord Plunket, had been a close friend of Elizabeth’s parents, then the Duke and Duchess of York.Plunket’s mother Dorothé was a half-American heiress and the couple were worldly and sophisticated members of the international set.But when Patrick was just 15 they died in a plane crash and he inherited the family title.In World War Two he served in the Irish Guards, then became an equerry for Elizabeth’s father, King George VI. When Elizabeth became queen, she appointed him Deputy Master of the Household.As such he masterminded the Queen’s banquets and State receptions, as well as the Royal Ascot house parties. He revelled in it, loving nothing more than to please and surprise his royal boss.As they discussed menus, guest lists and ways to keep boring guests at arm’s length, they became closer.Plunket’s cousin, Lady Annabel Goldsmith — mother of Jemima — said: “He adored her from the outset.“They enjoyed a very special connection. He was the one member of her staff who could talk to her on equal terms.“There was an openness and honesty between them based on respect, friendship — and a lot of teasing.”But the relationship was more than that. In 1956, when Prince Philip disappeared off on a world tour for four months on the royal yacht Britannia, Plunket provided a shoulder for the Queen to lean on, helping her through the lonely days and weeks.The royal marriage had reached a crisis point. Prince Philip had devoted himself to rejuvenating the monarchy and to selflessly serving the wife he loved, but there were impossible pressures on him.Yet the reforms that Philip sought in the Palace and beyond were often turned aside or ignored.“I’m just a bloody amoeba,” he complained, implying he was only there to father the next monarch — and nothing more.Philip’s 1956 tour seemed endless, and nobody seemed to know when he would come home. Questions were asked in the House of Commons.Reports started appearing in the American press of a serious rift in the royal marriage and rumours came back from Australasia of girls and parties aboard the Britannia.It was hastily arranged for the Queen to meet her husband in Lisbon, Portugal, before he returned home. And perhaps in a moment of panic, worrying that she might lose him, she made Philip a Prince of the United Kingdom — until then he had been only a Greek prince.At Windsor, Plunket continued to hold the Queen’s hand throughout the crisis. Lady Goldsmith said: “He was tall, impeccably dressed, with a voice full of merriment and his eyes crinkled up with laughter. He radiated an irrepressible sense of fun.”Philip finally came home and the royal marriage was rekindled.There had been a ten-year gap between the birth of Princess Anne and their next child, Prince Andrew — but things were back on track. If Philip had had an itch, it had been well and truly scratched.And yet there was still a need for Patrick Plunket by the Queen’s side.Her biographer, Sarah Bradford, said: “While Philip was off dancing with one of his women friends, Plunket would whirl Elizabeth on to the floor.“He’d notice at parties if she was looking lonely, scoop her up and dance with her, always there if she looked a bit lonely.”Royal biographer Charles Higham added: “He was slender, handsome, with thinning, dark hair and aristocratic profile. The Queen was very fond of him, very probably in love with him.”Historian Sir Roy Strong added: “He was one of the few who could give the Queen a glimpse of the world outside.”Plunket was not just playful, he was practical too. When the Queen discovered she needed a tiara for a formal occasion and found the Buckingham Palace safe was locked, he raced away and came back with a Plunket family heirloom.When she visited his house — a rare honour for a royal servant, however lordly — she teased him for looking “like a dentist” in the expensive portrait he had recently commissioned from artist Graham Sutherland.They laughed together a lot, especially during those crisis years. And even when he was terminally ill, he struggled from his sickbed to attend one last formal duty at Buckingham Palace, numbed by morphine as he tied his bow tie.That night, the Queen and her adoring courtier knew it would be the last time they would meet.Weeks later, at his memorial service at the Guards Chapel, his cousin Lady Goldsmith glanced at the Queen and “caught a look of deep sadness”.For the only time in her life, Her Majesty had a hand in writing an obituary for The Times, stressing Plunket’s unselfish service and duty.The article made it sound as though his service was for the whole Royal Family — but its meaning was clear to those who had witnessed Elizabeth and Plunket laughing together.A year after his death, with the position still vacant, a courtier asked the Queen who would replace him as Deputy Master of the Royal Household. She answered: “No one will ever replace him.”And so to the questions many people will be asking — was the Queen ever tempted? Was she unfaithful to Prince Philip, a man who has never quite escaped the swirl and fog of gossip about his own private life?Did Her Majesty succumb to the charms and handsome good looks of the 7th Lord Plunket?Royal biographer Robert Lacey, doesn’t think so. He said: “Opinions vary on Plunket’s sexuality,” and he quoted a fellow Guards officer who said: “He was one of those lucky characters who was just neutral.”But Charles Higham has a different take. He said: “Even if her royal duty had not been utterly binding, she could never have entered into a relationship with him, because he was homosexual.”Whatever the level of their relationship, it was intense and lasting. He was the only other man in her life.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A vibrant metropolis, at ease with its diverse, tolerant self.A shining example to the world of how folk from different backgrounds and cultures can rub along together.At least, that’s what we’re invited to believe. But the truth is this depiction of our capital city is not one recognised by millions of its citizens. That’s because London is, in fact, a tale of two cities.There are the gentrified hotbeds of liberal cosmopolitanism — the Islingtons and Camdens — top-heavy with the professional classes and cultural elites, the type of areas that were a bedrock of Remain support in the EU referendum.But then there are those places outside the bubble. On the one hand the grittier, traditional working-class areas — the Canning Towns and Bermondseys — populated by those steamrollered by globalisation, for whom austerity and mass immigration have exacerbated the problems of low wages, poor housing and under-pressure public services.On the other, the middle-class suburbs — the Upminsters and Eastcotes — inhabited by those who sense that their “small c” conservatism is increasingly incongruous with the image of their city as a beacon of progressive modernity.It is between these places that a new and unintended coalition has emerged, born out of resentment at having  to watch their old-fashioned, socially conservative — what some describe as “faith, family and flag” — views shunned and disparaged by the liberal elite.You can see something similar writ large across England: An accidental alliance between once-loyal Labour voters in the post-industrial towns and Conservatives in the shires.It’s an alliance which manifested itself most starkly in the Brexit vote.For the Londoners that fall within these groups, their city is not the harmonious and cohesive ideal seen through the eyes of the chattering classes.It is, instead, a place increasingly atomised, where millions feel a diminishing sense of belonging and in which entire communities within a few hundred yards of each other live utterly parallel lives.Take, for example, the borough in which I grew up, Barking and Dagenham.As working-class as it gets, it was once the very essence of a traditional Labour heartland. Never affluent, but stable, close-knit and settled.Centred around a sprawling 1930s council estate and with generally healthy levels of employment — the dominant Ford factory being at the heart of local industry — Barking and Dagenham enjoyed its steady constancy, its social and cultural familiarity.For those short on money and opportunity, the concepts of place, belonging, identity and relationships take on so much more meaning.But then things changed. Over a few very short years, around the turn of the century, there was a sizeable influx of migrants, precipitating rapid social and cultural transformation.The demographic convulsions meant stable, settled Barking and Dagenham found itself in the eye of the storm of the debate over mass immigration.The indigenous population cried out for respite. The letters page of the local paper was filled with correspondents begging to be heard. But nobody in power took a blind bit of notice, other than to patronise them with trite arguments about improved GDP and cultural enrichment.Rather than rally to their support, the Left — including, shamefully, the Labour Party and trade unions — treated these marginalised working-class folk like an embarrassing elderly relative, imploring them to “stop blaming migrants” (something they hadn’t done in the first place).What was genuine bewilderment and disorientation on the part of local citizens was, inexcusably, dismissed as casual racism and bigotry.Yet it wasn’t their sense of race that had been violated by the sudden upheaval in their community. It was their sense of order.So, in 2006, locals took the only route of protest they thought left available to them and returned  12 British National Party councillors at the local elections.The noxious far-Right, which previously had never gained a foothold in the borough (though it had penetrated areas close by) now formed the official opposition on Barking and Dagenham council, not because thousands of locals had overnight turned into vile racists, but because they had repeatedly been ignored by a tin-eared establishment.But even then, nothing changed. Locals were told to get with the zeitgeist.Women in their eighties who had lived in the borough for most of their lives, had raised  families there and in many cases now lived a life of lonely isolation, were told to embrace the vibrancy of the new multiculturalism.That was the level of condescension to which the liberal establishment had sunkSo thousands of people simply upped sticks and left. In the first decade of the new century, Barking and Dagenham experienced a vast exodus of families who had been rooted in its streets, workplaces and  institutions for generations.It was the only home that many had ever known, but they went all the same. They departed for the Essex coast or Kent. It wasn’t “white flight”, for skin colour was irrelevant to most of them.It was, instead, a flight to familiarity.The tragedy was that most of these people never were anti-immigration. They would not have objected to the integration of a modest and manageable number of arrivals over a reasonable period.But the whole debate around immigration has been toxified by what the ruling elites imposed on places such as Barking and Dagenham.They shook a kaleidoscope then stood back in surprise when the pieces didn’t fall exactly where they wanted. Remember all this the next time you hear someone speak of London as the greatest city in the world.Chances are the words are being spoken by a politician or a celebrity or a middle-class liberal from one of the trendier parts of town.For there are, in reality, two Londons. One half — alienated, neglected and resentful — represents a potentially formidable army at the ballot box.Who will speak for it?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats the message of these local elections around the country - that Conservative councils deliver great local services at lower taxes.The PM added: We wont take anything for granted. We will continue to work hard for local people and we will build on this success for the future.Earlier Mr Corbyn held a rally in Plymouth, where Labour won the council in one of its few major victories of the local elections.He insisted that the story of the night was Ukip losing ground - and claimed theres much more to come from Labour despite their election flop.But elections expert Sir John Curtice said: The truth is there isnt really much for the Labour party to celebrate this morning.On a night of mixed fortunes for both main parties:A Labour shadow minister told The Sun last night: “Jeremy has not spent the 11 months since the General Election winning Middle England, and now never will.We’re not going to do as well as we should, and I suspect these results will show we are past peak Corbyn.”Speaking in Plymouth, the Labour leader was asked if Britain has reached peak Corbyn and replied: No, no, theres much more to come and its going to get even better.Asked why Labour had failed to make the predicted gains, Mr Corbyn said: The story of the night is that Ukip have collapsed across the country, that we have gained in Plymouth.We have also put up our vote in a lot of other places and gained wards weve never held before in some of the London boroughs.Were ready for a General Election whenever it comes.In a statement he added: Labour achieved a solid set of results in the local elections.We have consolidated and built on the advances we made at last year’s General Election, when we won the largest increase in Labour’s share of the vote since 1945.His deputy Tom Watson insisted the party was quietly satisfied by the result.Labours other big win overnight was in Trafford, held by the Tories since 2014, where Labour is now the largest party.But the Conservatives held on to Labour target Swindon, and took control in Peterborough and Basildon - while Labour lost their majority in Derby and Nuneaton.Labour made gains in London, adding to its vote across the capital - but in an embarrassing blow, they failed to take control in the key target councils of Wandsworth, Westminster and Hillingdon despite pouring resources into the seats.Mr Corbyns followers also lost out in the North London seat of Barnet, where the anti-Semitism scandal appears to have an impact.Labour MP Jess Phillips took aim at her leader this morning, tweeting:  I see everyone is claiming failure as victory.Labour bosses appeared to admit they had made a mistake by hyping up expectations of huge gains in London and elsewhere.Campaigns chief Andrew Gwynne said the party was never likely to take the Tories flagship London councils and admitted Labour had seen disappointing results in many parts of the country.Conservative party chairman Brandon Lewis told Sky News: Its clearly a good night for us, weve done better than expected.But its just stage one of the work we want to do over the next few years leading to the next General Election.Boris Johnson added: No one is going to be complacent about these results, we are going to work very, very hard... [but] it has been an encouraging night.With nearly two thirds of the councils declared, all three parties had slightly increased their number of councillors - at the expense of Ukip, which has almost totally collapsed.Overall, Labour won many more seats than the Conservatives because this years local elections mostly took place in urban areas where the left tends to be stronger.The pro-EU Lib Dems took Richmond-upon-Thames in South-West London from the Tories, as well as holding on to the other councils they controlled.MP Christine Jardine told the BBC: Its a good night for us - and its a long time since we felt that.Leader Vince Cable added: Were very much on the way back.In Plymouth, one of Labours major bright spots, local Tory MP Johnny Mercer blamed the partys defeat on cuts to the military with defence being one of the areas major employers.He said: Ive made very public my concerns around the handling of defence at the moment and what the vision is.As well as council elections across England, there was one parliamentary by-election - Sinn Fein easily held on to the seat of West Tyrone, where the previous MP quit after mocking IRA victims.Counts are continuing throughout today, with the final results not expected until this evening in some areas.If todays results were replicated in a General Election, the Tories would lose a dozen seats with the Lib Dems making gains - meaning Theresa May would no longer have a majority even with the DUPs support.More than 4,250 council seats were up for grabs in more than 150 areas.It was the first electoral test for both Labour and the Tories since last years general election where Mrs May lost her majority and Mr Corbyn won an extra 30 seats for Labour.Both parties have experienced setbacks in recent weeks - with Mr Corbyns Labour being blasted with an anti-Semitism scandal, and the Tories being hit with the Windrush saga, which claimed the scalp of Home Secretary Amber Rudd.All parties were nervous ahead of today’s counts, having failed to see the shock 2017 election result coming when Theresa May threw away a massive poll lead and Mr Corbyn stormed to 40 per cent of the national vote.One Tory grandee said last night: “After 2017, we’ve all learned not to trust our very best instincts”.Local elections were held in all 32 London boroughs, 30 metropolitan districts, 17 unitary authorities and 67 district councils across England.Five council mayors were also up for election in Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets and Watford, as well as a metro mayor election for the new Sheffield City region.Yesterday scores of voters faces trouble casting their ballots and were even turned away, as a controversial new voting system which required ID was trialled in parts of the country.And Bradford Council apologised for demanding some voters present ID when they didnt need to.Meanwhile, voters flocked to the polls to take adorable snaps of their pet pooches too, as the #DogsAtPollingStations trend took off for the fourth year running."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403461731.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk weather may day bank holiday 28c beach traffic","story":"Traffic is already building up on major roads across the country as sun-seekers race to coastlines to make the most of the balmy extended weekend.Steamy hot conditions on Monday will eclipse sunny hotspots across Europe, with temperatures in Benidorm forecast for just 21C.This afternoon is expected to be the busiest time on the roads with 2.9 million trips, peaking in the early evening.Rod Dennis, RAF traffic spokesman, said: Many will be keen to make the most of the early May warmth by escaping in the car to spend time with family or friends - especially after the recent chilly spell that even lead to some overnight frosts at the start of this week.

Can you confirm we’re cleared to land?”Officials allegedly confirmed that the runway was clear but were not aware the plane was lined up to land on the crowded parallel taxiway instead.The pilot eventually aborted the landing after his co-pilot ordered him to go around go around after the officer looked outside and noticed it didnt look right”.Air Canada has not yet disclosed if any action was taken against the pilot and first officer after both told air investigators they were left tired after manoeuvring around thunderstorms earlier in the flight.According to the NTSB report, the 56-year-old flight captain has 20,000 hours flying experience, and the first officer had 10,000.In previously released audio from the cockpits of aircraft on the runway at the time, concerned pilots could be heard exclaiming: “Air Canada flew directly over us”.Speaking to Mercury News, retired United Airlines Capt. Ross Aimer said the outcome of a collision of this nature could have been “horrific”.He said: If it is true, what happened probably came close to the greatest aviation disaster in history.If you could imagine an Airbus colliding with four passenger aircraft wide bodies, full of fuel and passengers, then you can imagine how horrific this could have been.This is pretty huge.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000403438772.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"lidl cannabis products europe switzerland hemp tobacco","story":"The sale of cannabis has been legal in Switzerland to people who are 18 and over since 2011, as long as it contains no more than 1% of THC -

Gordon, which vanished while travelling from Glasgow in Scotland to Australia in 1876, or the Magdala, voyaging from Wales to Indonesia.“For the iron ship, the barques Kooringa (1894), Lake Ontario (1897) and West Ridge (1883) are possible, with the West Ridge best fitting the evidence,” said Mr Anderson.The hull structure of the wooden ship and other timbers appeared to have totally degraded, leaving only the remains of its coal cargo and metal objects such as fastenings, anchors and fittings.“The evidence points to the ship sinking as a result of a catastrophic event such as explosion, which was common in the transport of coal cargoes,” said Mr Anderson.One of the most interesting finds was a large rectangular metal object, 6m in length, which initially generated excitement as a possible treasure chest.But it was later found to be the metal ship’s iron water tank.The second wreck was more intact, lying upright on the seabed with at least two decks and visible portholes at the stern.Dr Anderson said more work – and funding – is needed before his team can be certain over the identity of the wrecks.If it was a shipwreck that we could dive on ... wed be looking for any artefacts like ceramics or bottles or anything that could confirm providence, Dr Anderson added.These are the deepest wrecks so far located in the Indian Ocean, theyre some of the most remote shipwrecks in the world, so we try to maximise any information.The wrecks of two other 20th century trawlers were also found but the Australian Transport Safety Bureau did not ask the museum carry out further research.When the sonar search first located the wreckage, it was briefly thought that the remnants of MH370 had been found.Hopes were dashed when high-resolution images showed that it was a ship rather than aircraft which had been discovered.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres all you should know about why they are different.Ramadan is a period of fasting observed by Muslims across the globe to celebrate the best of times.It celebrates the first time the Koran was revealed to Muhammad, according to Islamic belief.Fasting is only obligatory for healthy adult Muslims, anyone who is suffering from an illness, travelling, elderly, pregnant, breastfeeding, diabetic, chronically ill or menstruating are exempt from the practice.The fasting period, during which Muslims are not allowed to eat or drink, is from dawn to sunset and Muslims engage in increased prayer activity.Muslims often try and practice a increased self discipline during the month of Ramadan.Ramadan Mubarak translates to mean either blessed Ramadan or happy Ramadan.Ramadan Kareem means may Ramadan be generous to you but there is some debate as to if it should be used during Ramadan.The greetings are different as Ramadan Mubarak offers a blessed or happy Ramadan to the person it is exchanged with.Where as Ramadan Kareem has debate around its use as it asks Ramadan to be generous to the other person.There is some disagreement over its use as some people believe that asking Ramadan to be generous to you goes against the teachings of Islam, because Ramadan itself cannot be generous to an individual.Saudi Arabian scholar Sheikh Al-Uthaymeen told the Express: “It should be said ‘Ramadan Mubarak’, or whatever is similar to it, because it is not Ramadan itself that gives so that it can be kareem (generous), in fact it is Allah who placed the grace in it, and made it a special month, and a time to perform one of the pillars of Islam”.Ramadan Murbarak is the most commonly used of the two as it was originally used by the prophet MuhammadHowever, others believe using Ramadan Kareem is fine because they say the phrase represents the blessings that Allah gives his follows during the month.Jordan’s Iftaa’ Department, which is responsible for religious decrees, last year ruled: “Describing Ramadan to be honourable does not in fact attribute the quality to the month.“Rather, the word comes from the fact that God gives his worshippers blessings during the month.“It’s thus acceptable to call the thing by the name of its reason or cause.Some Muslims view Ramadan Kareem as a more respectful way of referring to Ramadan.Both greetings can be used throughout the whole month of Ramadan but Ramadan Murbarak tends to be the more commonly used of the two.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.
