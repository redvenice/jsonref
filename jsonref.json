He makes a circle with his hands. ‘It’s about that big with a thick crust.’Instead I have the haggis, neeps and tatties (£9).The tasty haggis is supplied by Cockburn’s of Dingwall and is actually not bad, but the vegetables are lumpy and the dish is so badly made and terribly served — slumped on a plate with a splat of whisky sauce on top — that it looks like an unspeakable effluence that has been ejected at speed from the Monarch of the Glen himself.         In those days there were starched tablecloths, silver teapots and uniformed stewards who came around at night to knock on the cabin door to serve your complimentary nightcapNothing is actually freshly made on site but cooked and pre-plated elsewhere in the dreary modern way, before being heated up in the train’s warming ovens.Still, at least there are some genuine Scottish delicacies on board, in the form of Mackie’s haggis crisps (£1.10), and Tunnock’s teacakes (50p), hurrah. They also charge 50p for an apple — at these ticket prices you’d think they could find it in their hearts to give them away free, but no.Back in my cabin I snuggle under the crisp cotton sheets and lulled by the rocking of the train, fall into a deep and lovely sleep.Sleeper travel has always been expensive, but for me travelling home on the Highland line, to Perth and beyond, is more convenient than flying.Booked in advance once meant that tickets were cheaper and there was the option of sharing a compartment with twin bunks. That is no longer the case, and the pricing system offers few bargains to travellers like me — unless you want to pay £45 to sit up all night.I have booked breakfast in the dining car at 6am but oversleep. At 6.10 I am woken by a female Scottish voice crackling through my ears. ‘Hello! Hello! Jan. That’s your breakfast ready. Repeat, your breakfast is ready for you.’What? Is that my mother? Mum? Whassgoinon? I had no idea they had a kitchen to cabin intercom system. But now I do.On the sleeper train, there is still drenching romance to be had if you time it right. I have breakfast as the train speeds through the beautiful border country, past fields shimmering with the pink mist of dawn, through the hill farms dotted with sheep and two old Clydesdale horses, almost skipping in the spring sunshine.         The dining car is smart and comfortable, but understaffed with only one waiter and a kitchen hand, making everyone a little testy. Clearly the experience is aimed at those who might be impressed with a menu that promises to ‘celebrate Scotland’s food culture with mouth-watering meals’Yet despite all the improvements, a part of me does mourn the sleepers of old. Even I can remember when dining cars had genuine kitchens staffed with real chefs, who would sizzle bacon, fry farm eggs and cook up proper breakfasts for 50 in a space the size of a telephone box. The porridge was historic and always made with water and salt, never with Sassenach cream and sugar, in the proper Scottish way.In those days there were starched tablecloths, silver teapots and uniformed stewards who came around at night to knock on the cabin door to serve your complimentary nightcap.‘Whisky or brandy, madam?’ they would say. How civilised. Still, progress means we have more comfort and less pain, give or take the loss of charm.Yes, the Carstairs shunt is more of a gentle bump — that really is progress — and you can even have a shower in your room, can you imagine!So back in my cabin, I get in the shower cubicle, switch on the tap and wait to experience the latest in luxury train travel.Except there is no water.

I loved every minute of my job,\u0027 the dad-of-two told Yahoo Lifestyle.  But just two months ago, Carroll began feeling disillusioned by his job and started to write down his grievances.His frustrations and fears echo those of his counterparts across the country which have led to teachers striking over overcrowded classrooms and low wages in recent months.Carroll is unhappy with a whole host of things - everything from overly-digitized classrooms, high-stakes test scores, burnt-out students, to his yearly salary of $48,000.Carroll has decided to leave teaching once and for all, at the end of the month.         Carroll told how he became frustrated with overcrowded classrooms and low wages. He is pictured here with wife, Dana\u0027So I guess this is it.... I am leaving the field of education.

I think of all the things I did not sign up for.... like micromanaging administrators, mental health counseling, blueprints with no freedom or flexibility (even though you can not enforce planning), not being considered an expert in my chosen field even though I have a graduate degree. \u0027Students overdosing on drugs and collapsing in my classroom when they get back from the bathroom. Active shooter drills. Teachers being armed. Knowing where it is safe to hide in my classroom. Feeding and clothing my students. Buying my own supplies.

I am tired of the constant testing...tired of everyone else knowing better and being chastised if I dare ask questions or challenge leadership.

I store it in my garage for emergencies.\u0027There is also increased pressure on both students and teachers when it comes to test scores. Carroll suggests that standardized testing makes children burn out. It also makes teachers anxious over whether their classroom scores will affect their jobs: \u0027Children are pressured to succeed without factoring in their personal development,\u0027 he says.Now that he has finally made the decision to leave teaching, Carroll says he is enjoying it once again for the first time in years.

Photograph: Mark MarlowPA The Alliance Party, on the second day of counting, was continuing its surge in the local elections in Northern Ireland.The party entered the contest on 32 seats but even by lunchtime it had increased its representation by more than a third when it was up to 44 seats, with further gains expected before close of counting.The Greens and People Before Profit from low bases of four seats and one seat respectively also were performing well.The Ulster Unionist Party which won 88 seats in the 2014 local elections was having a disappointing election while Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice, which won 13 seats five years ago, acknowledged his party was not doing as well as expected.And while there were some shifts and changes in the DUP and Sinn Féin representation throughout the North’s 11 councils they by far remain the two dominant parties in Northern Ireland.The former Sinn Fein MP for West Tyrone Barry McElduff was elected to Fermanagh and Omagh District Council on Saturday afternoon.He was forced to stand down as an MP in January last year after he posed with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head on the anniversary of the 1976 Kingsmill massacre in which the IRA singled out and killed ten Protestant workmen in south Armagh.The SDLP, which won 66 seats in 2014, appeared to be holding its own although it may be down a small number of seats.The North’s chief electoral officer Virginia McVea said that close to 700,000 votes were cast in the election and that the majority of the 11 councils in Northern Ireland had seen turnouts of more than 50 per cent. The turnout in 2014 was 51 per cent.At lunchtime, and with votes still to be counted, just two of the North’s five main parties had made percentage gains.

She said he should not have made those remarks to the media. “(Jim) should have been coming through the normal routes, through the party, if he had concerns about those issues,” she said.“We will look at all of those issues after the election. We will be looking at vote management schemes, we will be looking at where we did very well and we will be looking at bad behaviour as well,” she said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881514.1556983620!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"campaigner eamonn mccann secures derry local election seat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Eamonn McCann celebrates after being elected for People Before Profit  in Derry.

The police believe the dissident republican group the New IRA was responsible.Mr Donnelly refused to answer when asked by The  about the murder of Ms McKee. In a post on social media after her murder, he said it had been “wrong” and added that he “would plead with those behind this attack to desist from any further attacks and seriously consider the consequences of their actions.”“I’m absolutely over the moon to have been chosen by the people of the Moor ward,” Mr Donnelly told The . “I’ve retained my seat, I’ve increased my vote, and I’d just like to thank each of the nearly 1,400 people who have come out and endorsed the work that I’ve been carrying out in the Moor ward over the last 5 years.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3880327.1556916882!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dup s first gay candidate elected in northern ireland local elections","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe DUP’s first openly gay candidate, Alison Bennington, has been elected to Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council.

Áine Groogan of the Green Party topped the poll in the Botanic electoral area of the city.Kyle Black, the son of murdered prison officer David Black, was elected in the Mid Ulster Council. He ran as a candidate for the DUP in the Carntogher electoral ward.Counting in the elections centres began at 8am on Friday with election centres likely to be working until late on Saturday before it is known which candidates fill the 462 seats on the North’s 11 councils.Derry ‘resurgence’SDLP leader Colum Eastwood claimed Northern Ireland was witnessing the party’s resurgence after it topped the poll in two of the District Electoral Areas (DEAs) in Derry.First-time candidate Mary Durkan polled more than 1,200 first preference votes in Foyleside and was elected on the first count.In Ballyarnett, Angela Dobbins was also elected on the first count with almost 1,400 first preference votes.The SDLP lost one seat to Rachael Ferguson of the Alliance Party - which won its first seat in Derry in almost 40 years - leaving the SDLP with a net gain of one seat.Shaun Harkin, who was elected for People Before Profit in the Foyleside District Electoral Area (DEA), is the party’s first councillor in Derry.Counting has moved on to the third stage in four of the seven DEAs in the Derry City and Strabane District Council area, with no other candidates so far elected.The remainder of the DEAs will be counted on Saturday.In Belfast, the SDLP’s Paul McCusker topped the poll in the Oldpark DEA with 2,856 votes, more than 1,200 votes over the quota of 1,619.“It’s early days for us in terms of the renewal project,” Mr Eastwood said, “but what we’re finding across the North is that in places where we run new, young, talented candidates and put a good campaign behind them we can win seats.“We have an awful lot of work to do across the North. There are large parts of the North where we need to put a lot of effort in, but we know what the formula is and we’re going to multiply it.Mr Eastwood refused to be drawn on whether Ms Durkan would be a potential candidate for the next Westminster election.Ms Durkan, who is a solicitor, is the sister of the SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan and the niece of the former Foyle MP Mark Durkan, who is now standing for Fine Gael in the European elections in Dublin.Sinn Féin had previously held 16 seats in the DCSDC council area, and the SDLP eight. There were seven DUP councillors, seven Independents, and two Ulster Unionists.In Ballyarnett retired GP Anne McCloskey is polling strongly for the all-Ireland anti-abortion party Aontú and is expected to be elected.There is also speculation that Rachael Ferguson in the Faughan ward could take the first Alliance seat in Derry since 1981.Among those already eliminated include Martin McGuinness’s former special adviser, Conor Heaney, who stood in the Faughan ward.Two sitting councillors – Gus Hastings of the SDLP and Thomas Kerrigan of the DUP – have lost their seats.TurnoutJust over 1.3 million were entitled to vote in this proportional representation, single transferable vote election. Turnout was said to be steady at the polling stations throughout Thursday with the total poll expected to be close to or on a par with the 51 per cent turnout at the last local elections in 2014.The DUP with 172 ran the most candidates. Sinn Féin stood 155 candidates, the Ulster Unionist Party 117, the SDLP 85 and Alliance 84.Sinn Féin topped the poll with 153,000 votes followed by the DUP on 145,000 in 2014. The transfer system worked in favour of the DUP who ended up with 130 seats while Sinn Féin won 105. The UUP was third winning 102,000 votes and taking 88 seats, with the SDLP on 85,000 votes and winning 66 seats.

It was her first time running and her success came despite losses for the party in polls nationwide. “It was a personal vote I think, and I have to say that I’m very proud of the result,” she said. Ms Pearson said she had gotten to know a lot of people in the area as her Scottish husband owned a pub there.“Comhghairdeas. Every success,” he posted. The newly-elected Tory councillor said she had spent much of her campaign explaining the Irish border to voters as she was “eaten alive” over Brexit. “Over here, in the papers and on the radio, nobody was talking about the border and what was going to happen in Ireland, something that was of huge importance to me,” she said. “They don’t understand the border. They think it’s like something they’ve seen on TV with guards walking up and down patrolling. “I was explaining how there are houses that straddle both sides of the border, and they found it hard to believe.“But it’s something that’s so important to me personally, and to everyone at home in Ireland.

Photograph: Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesVince Cable has hailed his Liberal Democrats party as “the big winners” of the local election, with the party gaining hundreds of seats and a series of councils.With 232 of the 248 councils tallied up, the Lib Dems had won 1,179 seats, a net gain of 571 in an election set to be Mr Cable’s swansong in charge.At that point in the counting, the Conservatives had lost 1,048 seats, and Labour 72, while the Greens had gained 153 seats and independents 183.However, the Liberal Democrats’ success should be put in the context of disastrous results the last time the same areas were fought.Among the areas taken were the traditional Tory stronghold of Cotswold district council, where they overtook the Conservatives to become the biggest single party, winning 18 of the 34 seats.Arguably more striking was Bath and north-east Somerset, where the Lib Dems gained 23 seats to easily overturn the previous Tory majority, winning 37 of the 59 seats – including the home ward of Tory Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg.As the results came in, Mr Cable opted to travel to Chelmsford in Essex, where his party overturned a previous 45-seat Conservative majority, amassing a net gain of 26 seats, while the Tories lost 31.The party also gained Winchester, Vale of White Horse, Hinckley and Bosworth, North Devon and North Norfolk. They also took the newly-formed authority of Somerset West and Taunton, formed by the merger of two other councils.‘Big winners’Mr Cable told celebrating Liberal Democrats activists that the result reflected a “story across the country”. He said: “The Lib Dems were written off at one point but we’re coming back very, very strongly. We’re the big winners of the night throughout the country.”Mr Cable added: “Today’s Lib Dem surge is a springboard to the European elections, where we are clearly the strongest remain force on the ballot paper. Every Liberal Democrat vote on May 23rd will be a vote to stop Brexit. ”However, the result seemed to have a broader impetus than just Brexit, with analysis showing the party only did slightly better in remain-voting areas than those which supported leave in 2016. Chelmsford, perhaps the most dramatic Lib Dem gain, supported leave in the referendum.The other context is that the Lib Dems had been widely expected to gain seats given than the last time the same councils were fought was May 2015, when the party was being roundly punished by voters following the Conservatives-Lib Dem coalition.Then, the Lib Dems lost more than 400 seats and four councils. In the general election on the same day the party slumped from 57 Westminster seats to eight.Under pressureMeanwhile, Conservative councillors and MPs have called for prime minister Theresa May to step down after the party lost more than 1,000 seats.Council leaders called for the prime minister to consider her position while others said they had made gains despite the government’s paralysis since the 2016 EU referendum. A heckler interrupted Mrs May as she gave a speech in Wales, saying: “Why don’t you resign? We don’t want you.”The Conservative group leader, Tony Berry, said it was a “very unusual set of circumstances” because of Brexit and “professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country”.Delivering a message to the prime minister, he said: “I would ask her to consider her position very carefully.”In Bath and North East Somerset, where Tory losses included the council leader, Tim Warren, who said councillors had been “given a kicking for something that wasn’t our fault”.Asked whether there needed to be changes in leadership or policies at the top of the party, Mr Warren replied: “There needs to be a change in action.”Other home counties losses for the Conservatives include Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Folkestone \u0026amp Hythe, St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield.A succession of pro-leave Tories called on Friday morning for Mrs May to step down. The MP Crispin Blunt said the party needed to replace Mrs May with a new leader.“I’ve been trying to get her out openly since December. Lots of people are trying to get the message over.”Good newsIn a rare piece of good news for Mrs May, the Conservatives took control of Walsall council after winning seats from Labour, having run the authority for a year without a majority.The council leader, Mike Bird, said they had won “despite” the Conservative government and Theresa May.“She hasn’t helped us make any gains at all – far from it – we made the gains despite the prime minister,” he said.Despite some predictions that Jeremy Corbyn’s party could pick up three-figure gains, Labour were unable to capitalise on the Conservatives’ struggles. Labour was down more than 70 seats, though it did have the consolation of restoring control in Trafford for the first time sine 2003."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3881492.1556974037!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"i think it is a miracle boeing 737 slides off runway into river","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA  Boeing 737 aircraft after it went off the runway at Naval Air Station Jacksonville and into the St Johns River. Photograph: Jacksonville, Florida Sheriff’s OfficeAFPGettyA charter plane carrying 143 people has ended up in a Florida river at the end of a runway, though no critical injuries or deaths were reported.The Boeing 737 slid off the runway and into the St Johns River after arriving at Naval Air Station (NAS) Jacksonville from Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, with 136 passengers and seven aircrew on board.The Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office posted on Twitter that a marine unit responded to assist.The plane is in shallow water and not submerged. Everyone on the plane is alive and accounted for, the agency posted, with 21 adults transported to local hospitals in good condition.A photo posted by deputies shows a Miami Air International logo on the plane.Captain Michael Connor, the commanding officer of NAS Jacksonville, said during a news conference that passengers were a mix of civilian and military personnel. Some were staying in the area, while others were set to fly on to other parts of the country.While the crash certainly was not ideal, Capt Connor acknowledged that it could have been much worse.“I think it is a miracle,” he said. “We could be talking about a different story this evening.”It is not known how long it will take to remove the plane from the river, but Capt Connor said the landing gear appeared to be resting on the river bed, making it unlikely for the aircraft to float away.He said crews began working to contain any jet fuel leaks almost immediately after securing the passengers’ safety.Liz Torres told the Florida Times-Union that she heard what sounded like a gunshot on Friday night from her home in Orange Park, about five miles south of NAS Jacksonville. She then drove down to a Target car park where police and firefighters were staging to find out more.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” she said.The Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department posted on Twitter that approximately 90 personnel responded to the scene, adding that the department’s special operations team had trained with marine units for a similar incident earlier on Friday.Navy security and emergency response personnel were on the scene and monitoring the situation, with family members who were expecting the arrival of passengers instructed to stand by.Officials did not immediately say what caused the plane to leave the runway.Capt Connor said National Transportation Safety Board investigators are already on their way. - AP"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph audio briefings sign new whatsapp group","story":"Want audio briefings direct to your WhatsApp?

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress on Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignMisogynists turn to the classics to celebrate the patriarchyKevin Pietersen: Government \u0026#39could write cheque\u0026#39 to save rhinos nowForget the Thames, the only way was Essex for CaesarTories are leaving communities feeling \u0026#39forgotten\u0026#39 as ministers view the country \u0026#39through a lens of spreadsheets and efficiency savings\u0026#39, Sajid Javid saysLondon Marathon nurse denied world record for not wearing a dressMinisters launch crackdown on bad behaviour in schoolsTeachers are leaving school in groups for fear of \u0026#39violent repercussions from parents\u0026#39Guaidó and advisers were \u0026#39too impatient\u0026#39 to oust Maduro, says man who led coup against ChávezA 17-year-old boy is arrested on suspicion of murder after teenage girl found dead in Wiltshire houseShort shrift for Napoleon complex as it turns out he was quite niceReturn of reel-to-reel as musicians reject digital for better sound of dated technologyBritain should leave the EU before MEPs take their seatsRoyal fans gather in Windsor in anticipation of Baby SussexIsrael retaliates after more than 150 rockets fired from GazaLocal elections: Bricklayer and former community centre manager among independents who stormed to victoryUffizi director questions DNA tests of Leonardo\u0026#39s hair amid row over artist\u0026#39s bones on 500th anniversary of deathPublic spat between bishop and dean over Westminster Abbey’s nuclear deterrent commemoration  Comment: The Tories have only days left to boot out Theresa May -

Barnaby Lenon, former headmaster of Harrow School, this week declared that the “virtue” of being middle class “is now regarded as sin”. Which is true, to a degree.

That represents an improvement on the previous month in which the sector shrank, recording 48.9.\u0026nbspBut as a recovery it’s about powerful as a broken down lawn mower engine.It’s de rigueur in any discussion\u0026nbspof economic data to provide a point of context. In the case of this one, the last two months represent the weakest performance signalled by this dataset for six years. \u0026nbspCarney, however, said he believed that surveys like this one may be over stating “Brexit uncertainty”. An example of the Bank being infected by the Brexiteer disease that holds that you’re a bally traitor if you display anything other than mindless optimism about their crazy project?\u0026nbspThat’s pushing it. Carney merely thinks investors are being too dovish and that even a modest improvement in the UK’s outlook would require remedial action from the central bank. Anything above 1.5 per cent - which would hardly put the UK in the class of the Jaguar cars that won’t be being made here for much longer - would do it. \u0026nbspThis, he thinks, is a realistic prospect if the Brexit impasse is finally resolved. He\u0026nbspalso appears to be ruling out a no deal.\u0026nbspHe may very well be guilty of underestimating the depths to which the Tory Party is prepared to sink. Perhaps it’s because he most often talks to Philip Hammond, who is on it’s semi sensible wing.Regardless, savers shouldn\u0027t get too excited about an improvement on the dismal returns they\u0027re currently getting.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Chris Williamson, the chief business economist at IHS Markit, tweeted a couple of important points upon their release. He produced a graph showing that the official GDP data has erged somewhat from the PMI recently, which does happen every now and again.\u0026nbspBut long term they’re quite closely aligned and he noted that it would be “highly unusual for the economy to at least not lose substantial momentum when the PMI has sunk to current levels for more than one month”.

On the table was a bottle of wine. When they ordered a second, there was an audible ripple of admiration around the room. Fellow diners smiled in their direction.\u0026nbspThis scene unfolded recently in a City restaurant. Indeed, the two men looked as if they had met for a bit of a stockbroker reunion, to reminisce about their share trading, and lunching, days.\u0026nbspHardly anyone has a “two bottler” any more. Not at lunch on a work day. One bottle is rare, but a couple –\u0026nbspthat is going some.\u0026nbspEven a glass of wine is relatively scarce. If I look through my diary of a month’s worth of business lunches, those where the other person had a glass (like many, I no longer drink at lunchtime) amount to just a handful.\u0026nbspIn most workplaces today, drinking during working hours is frowned upon, as is consuming enough alcohol in the evening so that your breath smells of it the following morning. Doing the latter once may be okay\u0026nbspdo it twice or more, and you will be marked down as having “a problem”.\u0026nbspLloyd’s of London bans drink and drugs in the workplaceTimes have changed enormously since I started out, first in the City, then in media. Back then, and we’re talking more than three decades ago, it was standard to head to the nearest wine bar or the pub, and polish off a few glasses of wine or pints of beer before returning to your desk and attempting to work.\u0026nbspSometimes, as a junior, you felt obliged to keep your end up, so when the partners at my law firm, all male, lined up another bottle I would gulp and go along with it. Likewise, as a journalist, you occasionally had to go with the flow\u0026nbspas part of the job.\u0026nbspOne of the booziest lunches I ever had was with Crispin Odey, the hedge fund magnate. When I arrived to interview him at Corrigan’s –\u0026nbspthe super-smart Mayfair restaurant of star chef Richard Corrigan –\u0026nbspI was treated like royalty. Odey was running slightly late, and I was shown to a prime table. The staff bustled around, checking I was okay\u0026nbspnothing was too much for them. Finally\u0026nbsphe arrived, and they went into overdrive.A bottle of normally exquisite –\u0026nbspand expensive –\u0026nbspwhite Burgundy was produced, which Odey decided was not quite right. The sommelier scurried away to fetch another one. Odey glanced at the menu and knew what he wanted: a duck egg to start, followed by, if I agreed, a shared steak and kidney pie. “And what about some beef on the side, let’s have the loin of beef on the side. Lovely. Oh, and we’d better have some mash and some kale –\u0026nbspwe ought to have something green.”He called over the wine waiter again: “And we’d like a bottle of the Leoville.” The Leoville Barton was superb, as was the food. This was mid-week. A bottle of white, and a bottle of red. Beef on the side. Even back then, nobody had lunch like this, not any more, not in oh-so politically correct, watching-the-calories, London. Not on this scale, and even more rarely, at this cost. What’s more, with Odey, there was the feeling this was nothing special. The office of his firm, Odey Asset Management, was across the road, and Corrigan’s might as well have been his canteen.As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible, and started to angle down the page,\u0026nbspuntil the words trailed off completelySo, when I read an interview this week with veteran advertising boss Rory Sutherland, I was drawn to his statement that his industry is inordinately less boozy than it was: “Mind you, everything is less boozy. It was pretty routine at lunchtime to see people in the street outside a pub at 2.30 necking pints. It was also routine in advertising, which I always thought was a good thing which we shouldn’t have lost.”Sutherland was reminiscing in the same month that Lloyd’s of London has issued a new stern code of conduct to the 40,000 pass holders at its Leadenhall Street headquarters. From now on, anyone thought to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol will be refused entry. This, from what was regarded for its 331 year existence as the high temple of lunchtime boozing.\u0026nbspWho is right, who is wrong? Lloyd’s move was motivated by claims of sexual harassment and bad, laddish behaviour. It effectively signals the end for what was known euphemistically in the City as “liquid negotiations” or what Brexiteer Nigel Farage, a former broker, refers to as PFLs\u0026nbsp– “proper f***ing lunches”.\u0026nbspLike Nigel, I enjoyed my PFLs. Like Rory, too, I look back at them with fondness.\u0026nbspBut I also have to ask myself:\u0026nbspapart from spending what, over the years, would have amounted to a considerable sum of money, piling on the calories, and making me feel terrible the rest of the day, what did they actually achieve? Of course, they fostered camaraderie, of the loud, male, kind.\u0026nbspI also\u0026nbspsaw, though, far too many careers and lives ruined by what began as the odd PFL turning into a daily occurrence. A liquid lunch would then be replicated by something similar in the evening, every evening. One of\u0026nbsp those, doubtless, was Guy Farage, a City trader and alcoholic\u0026nbspwho abandoned the family home and his son, Nigel, then aged five.\u0026nbspDid any good come from them? I would venture, not where progress at work was concerned. I attempted to fire questions at Odey. As the lunch progressed, my handwriting became illegible\u0026nbspand started to angle down the page, until the words trailed off completely. I had to finish the interview when I was sober.\u0026nbspLloyd’s initiative is long overdue. We may miss the lunchtime drinking. But if we’re honest, not really.\u0026nbspChris Blackhurst is a former editor of The Independent, and director of C|T|F Partners, the campaigns, strategic, crisis and reputational, communications advisory firmOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But thanks to\u0026nbspColston, who started localised growing programmes in 2018, her descendants have survived. Her great-great-great-great granddaughter is sitting at a table made from oak grown from an acorn Colston planted, and harvested at a a sawmill established under Colston’s watch, which has brought business back to the valley. “Thank you for making change happen and thank you for our future,” the descendant writes.\u0026nbspGovernment set to ‘miss public land housebuilding target by 95,000’NHS hospital in England refusing to accept patients from WalesScottish Government plans to tackle land ownership inequalityIt’s Wednesday lunchtime in an empty shopping unit in the Capitol Centre, Cardiff, and Colston is one of of a handful of residents presenting their vision for the future of the Welsh valleys. Nearly 100 people are gathered, including Welsh assembly members, local councillors, forestry authorities and community groups. The Skyline Project has\u0026nbspspent nine months engaging\u0026nbspartists to unlock residents’\u0026nbspideas about their natural environment. The resulting maps and quotations are pasted all over the gallery walls, including dreams of swimming pools, walking routes, honeybees and wild birds.Colston’s postcard might be fantasy today, but Skyline\u0026nbspsees this artistic reimagining as the first step to a community action plan for the land.One man is here to show them what’s possible. Alastair McIntosh was one of four founders of the Isle of Eigg Trust in 1991, which in the space of six years wrested the island in the Scottish Hebrides from rich owners and put it in the hands of the community. “It’s not about sloganising politics, it’s about figuring out things that are going to work,” he says. “You have to start digging with a teaspoon, then a spade, then a digger, and then political confidence to flow into those channels.”But Scotland has a very different tradition of land ownership. As well as positive examples of community ownership, Scotland has a history of crofting, or long term leases of private land to stewards, and momentum is growing for further reform. An investigation by the Scottish Land Commission found that concentrated land ownership in Scotland, where 1,125 people own 70 per cent of the land, has held back prospects for economic, housing and community development. The commission went so far as to describe the concentration of land ownership in Scotland as “socially corrosive”.The situation in Wales is different. Wales has fewer private landowners. It also has much more public land. The question for the groups involved in Skyline is whether they can get public bodies to support their ideas. “Being able to get land is a political thing,” says Mark Walton, the co-director of Shared Assets. “In Scotland it required legislation. What’s exciting is that Skyline is looking at what is already publicly owned land. It is in the gift of authorities to transfer ownership to communities or give them leases to allow the to manage productively. That’s a massive opportunity because it overcomes the main barrier to entry, which is the cost of buying the land.”Walton says that an ambitious programme of land transfer to communities in urban areas has the potential to revitalise areas still reeling from the death of traditional industry, particularly in Wales and the north of England. But he acknowledges that is it sometimes difficult for authorities to cede power: “Authorities are afraid because this fundamentally changes the relationship between the state and the people. It changes the way the civil servants behave. It changes the dynamic – and that is scary.”Ian Thomas, runs Welcome to Our Woods, a community partnership in the upper Rhondda Fawr making local natural resources accessible to residents. In May, Welcome to Our Woods was awarded £90,000 in grants and loans from the Co-op Foundation, to put towards its project converting waste wood into furniture and biomass fuel, generating income. The money has been generated by the sale of 5p bags in the Co-op’s Welsh supermarkets.In October, Thomas, Colston and other volunteers from other valleys groups visited the Kilfinan Community Forest in Tighnabruaich, which manages ownership of 434 hectares of Acharossan Forest. Chris Blake, who started the Skyline Project, says that the trip proved the possibilities. “To see for yourselves what the forest crofts has achieved in eight years was quite staggering,” he says. “At the end of the day we sat down and suddenly we realised it can be done.”Geraint Davies, the Plaid Cymru councillor for Treherbert ward, is among those at the event in the shopping centre. As visitors browse\u0026nbspthe exhibition, he remembers playing in the mountains as a child:\u0026nbsp“We used to be up there making dams, but you don’t see children up there now.”Would he support community ownership of the land? “I think that would be wonderful,” he says. “It’s very important to get people committed to the area through ownership. In the past people have come in, done things, and gone again.”Lee Waters, the deputy minister for economy and transport at the Welsh assembly, sees Skyline as part of a broader movement for the democratic ownership of land and the economy that is going on in places like Preston in Lancashire and Barcelona in Spain.How South Wales is learning from community forests in Scotland“There has been a profound change going on in the valleys in just two generations. There’s been considerable depopulation\u0026nbspand some areas are returning to semi-rural, which creates a range of policy challenges but also opens up a new way of doing things,” Waters says. “Might the Welsh government give Skyline funding for land? There’s absolutely no reason why we wouldn’t. We’d have to see some detail but I think it’s got huge potential.”Thomas says the seeds of change have already been planted. “When we looked at our land we found that 85 per cent is public estate,” he says. “So we’re not talking about ownership because as far as we’re concerned we already own the land. It’s about what level of stewardship we get. What we are looking at is a micro-hydro scheme, a sawmill, solar farms and forest crofts.

Thousands of pupils from schools, colleges and universities across the UK will walk out in the second major strike against climate change this year. Young people nationwide are calling on the Government to declare a climate emergency and take action. Similar strikes are taking place around the world today including in Japan and Australia, inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg who criticised world leaders at a United Nations climate conferenceThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2022 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2122 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” 122 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.322 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.622 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 922 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1422 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 1722 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”1822 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that.

The ulnar nerve runs from the shoulder to the finger and manages intricate movements of the hand.“This may explain why he left numerous paintings incomplete, including the Mona Lisa, during the last five years of his career as a painter while he continued teaching and drawing,” Dr Lazzeri added.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Eighteen years on, the New Yorker recalls the horror of\u0026nbsp911 and its aftermath, and how it has informed his writing…Click to followThe IndependentSmoke pours from the twin towers of the World Trade Centre after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attackOn 10 September 2001, I went to bed with a stuffy head, and took a decongestant. So on the 11th I awoke late, groggy. My wife had already left for work. Our dog kept me company while I shaved and showered, dressed and caffeinated. I was aiming to leave for the office by a quarter to nine.I was one minute late.So it was 8.46am when I bent to say goodbye to Charlie Brown, and off to the side some fast movement caught my eye, with a whirr-whoosh that sounded like a cartoon version of an incoming missile, some disaster about to befall Wile E\u0026nbspCoyote. I spun my head to the window where the noise had shot by, but I saw nothing. I stood up. I turned to the south. That’s when I saw.This was not a great apartment. But one corner of the loft was lined with huge windows that faced the Hudson River to the west, and the World Trade Centre\u0026nbspjust a couple of blocks to the south. The view was breathtaking, the immensity of the towers filling your field of vision. Sometimes I’d just sit and stare at the towers, awestruck.Now, at 8.47 on a Tuesday morning, I was staring at a hole in one of the buildings.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.I immediately called my wife, told her, “I think the World Trade Centre just got hit by a missile.” I turned on the television, which was at first reporting nothing definitive, but the situation was definitely alarming. I was still staring out the window, listening to nothing on the TV, when the second plane hit. The fireball briefly looked like it was never going to stop expanding, it would engulf me. I flinched away, nearly toppled over my chair.Now we knew that New York was being attacked. But was that attack finished? Or were these planes just the first two salvos of a massive bombardment, an invasion of the country, the end of the world as we know it?On 911, people remember their favourite story about Steve BuscemiI definitely didn’t want to go outside. Our home was surrounded by high-value targets – City Hall, Wall Street, both the New York and the American Stock Exchanges, the Federal Building, every level of government and finance, the main switching station for transatlantic and East Coast telephone calls, big bridges and long tunnels, all this crucial infrastructure was right out the door. Back in college in the 1980s, I’d taken a poli-sci class called War and Peace in the Nuclear Age, and one of our assignments was to determine the single spot in the entire world that could do the most damage – human fatalities, economic disruption, political upheaval – with a modest-sized nuclear device. Everyone in the class came up with the same answer: that spot was right here. It was demonstrable it was math.What was I going to do? I definitely wasn’t going to the office. But should I be behaving as if the city was\u0026nbspbeing invaded? What would that behaviour look like?I started to notice pieces of building falling off a tower, one bit after another, from the very top. This didn’t make sense, I didn’t see any damage up there. So I looked more carefully. Those were not bits of building. Those were people. They were jumping off the roof, a thousand feet in the sky.When the south tower began to collapse, for the briefest second it wasn’t obvious to me what was happening, then I understood, but it still wasn’t thoroughly clear how exactly the building was going to fall, or how much of it, or in what direction, and if that tower fell over like a lumberjacked tree, and tipped my way, it would land on me.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a partyThe immense cloud of dust and debris came hurtling towards me, a terrifying mass containing... what? Girders, I-beams, mammoth chunks of concrete, who the hell knew, maybe the entire collapsing building was in that cloud – was that cloud – headed my way at a hundred miles an hour, two hundred, who could tell? So I picked up Charlie Brown and fled from whatever was going to come crashing through the window, through the walls, through the roof. I shut us in the dark of the windowless bathroom.I thought: I might be about to die. Right now.When the debris cloud hit, the building shivered, and I heard a small crash, like someone had dropped a wineglass at a party. Was this the last noise I’d ever hear? I waited, my hands shaking as I stroked the dog, my heart racing...After a few seconds of nothing, I opened the door.I hadn’t turned on any lights that morning, because it was a spectacularly beautiful day, as usual for that time of year I have since come to think of it as 11 September weather. But now the rooms were almost completely dark in the blackout of that cloud. I couldn’t see anything out the windows, just thick dark greyness pushing up against the glass, like Stephen King’s fog. I turned on lights. The sound of shattering glass? That was a picture that had been shaken off the wall.I couldn’t even see the building across the street, 40ft away. But the cloud slowly dispersed until finally I could dimly make out the World Trade Centre site, where there was now only one Twin Tower. Was there really nothing left?The cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body partsJust a few minutes later, the other building came down.\u0026nbsp How did I not see that coming?I eventually went downstairs, outside, to reconnaissance. It was slow-motion chaos out there, shell-shocked people staggering through the mess, papers fluttering in the sky, everything under a thick coat of ash, like fresh snow. The only thing that seemed to be happening quickly were the sirens, they were wailing from every direction, fast-moving vehicles somewhere I couldn’t see. I found a policeman, who told me I should prepare to leave, the electricity was going to be turned off, the gas, the water too, all for safety. My building was going to be evacuated. The whole neighbourhood.So in the middle of the afternoon, I left home carrying a single change of clothing, and basic toiletries, and a couple of meals for Charlie Brown. My dog and I trudged through the ash across City Hall Park, up and over the Brooklyn Bridge, from which I couldn’t stop turning back to look over my shoulders, where there were no Twin Towers left at all.It didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t step back into our home for two weeks, and even then it was only a brief visit on a grim Sunday, accompanied by a police escort who was there to make sure we didn’t stay, or stick around too long. Also the cop was there to enter every home before the residents, to look around quickly for anything horrifying that might have come hurtling through a window. I heard that people had found body parts.My wife and dog and I were living with relatives uptown, in a spare bedroom. Indefinitely.We were finally allowed to move home in mid-October. Our neighbourhood had become the Frozen Zone, ning a few blocks in every direction from Ground Zero, penned in by thousands of feet of newly erected chain link patrolled by National Guardsmen in battle fatigues and helmets carrying assault rifles, militarised checkpoints, we had to present ID to prove our residency, our identity. The local school had been repurposed as a staging area for a rescue effort that never rescued a single person then for the recovery, the cleanup.The thing that’s impossible to understand if you weren’t there was the smell. Those massive piles of rubble – what was left of two tremendous buildings, each more than a quarter-mile tall – those piles were on fire for one hundred days, acrid clouds of smoke that weren’t fully extinguished until mid-December. The stench was sickening. The sounds of the earth-movers constant. The stadium lights glared all through the night, every night. The armoured vehicles and uniformed men, weapons everywhere: a warzone.But by 13 September\u0026nbspI’d returned to work. I was 33 years old, married but childless, a moment in life when nothing seems as important as career. So of course I went back to work. But my publishing house’s office building was threatened with bomb scares every few days, we needed to evacuate and wander around Midtown, anxiously awaiting the all-clear. Eventually we stopped believing, we stopped leaving, even while anthrax attacks were invading other media offices in the neighbourhood, killing other people who walked these very same streets, people who could have been me. Everyone jumped every time a truck rumbled by. I never slept through the night, and repeatedly injured myself in the kitchen, knife cuts, burns. At the time, I didn’t recognise\u0026nbspPTSD. I just knew my hands and arms were covered in wounds.This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishesWhat was coming next? We were all convinced it was something.In New York, especially down in the Frozen Zone, 11 September\u0026nbsplasted a very long time. The terror seemed permanent. It wasn’t.Fifteen years later, I rarely thought about terrorism anymore it became something that happened somewhere else. But then I went to one of those somewhere elses: Paris, still reeling from its own series of brutal terror attacks, a city with soldiers everywhere, bomb-sniffing dogs, everything suffused with tension, fear. This felt so familiar, this felt exactly like New York after 911, this new category of historical moment: a global metropolis sieged by terror.Not only did this remind me of 2001, it also reminded me of something that had become a constant part of my recent life: suspense novels, which I’d started writing in 2009. The beautiful foreign setting. The definite sense that something bad was going to happen, but the fundamental uncertainty about what exactly that bad thing would be, to whom, and why, and when. Is it now? What should I do? Should I be acting as if this is a life-and-death situation?Trump’s bizarre quotes about 911 before becoming presidentSeptember 11 memorial’s architect looks back, and ahead911 anniversary: Handwritten notes reveal how George W Bush reacted This all defined my experience of 911 and its aftermath, the uncertainty and confusion and mistaken assumptions – was that a missile, is the fireball going to engulf me, will the building fall on me, are there really bombs in the office, or anthrax, was that sound an explosion or a car backfiring, why the hell am I bleeding all the time?This is a terrifying way to live. That’s the point, isn’t it? That’s what terrorism is, that’s what it accomplishes.This is also what a certain type of suspense novel can do.Ever since 911, it had dwelt in the back of my mind that I’d someday write a novel that revolved around a terrorist event. But I didn’t want to write the expected novel, with the expected villains, the expected heroes I don’t want to write the expected anything.\u0026nbspThat someday was right now. The something that was happening next in Paris wasn’t an explosion, it was something much more mundane: I was going to write that terrorism novel, right now. I took my laptop to a café on the rue de Grenelle, opened a new file, and started work immediately, a story that begins on an autumn Tuesday morning at a quarter to nine, when normal ends.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Despite initial public disapproval and the threat of criminal charges and imprisonment, her\u0026nbspidea\u0026nbspstuck.\u0026nbspMartin Purdy\u0026nbspexplainsClick to followThe IndependentMs Leyel’s ballots helped set up Westfield War Memorial Village in Lancaster in the 1920s – it was a home for veteransIn December 1921, the public gallery of Marylebone Magistrates’ Court in London was filled with “fashionably dressed ladies’’ keen to hear the latest charges to be levied against a popular socialite called Hilda Leyel. In taking on such a well-connected member of British society, the prosecutors were playing with high stakes – and it was a roll of the dice that would ultimately result in the rules of charitable fundraising being changed for ever across the United Kingdom.The breaches of the Betting Act that\u0026nbspLeyel found herself charged with were all linked to a national lottery – one that by 1920 had already raised more than £250,000 to specifically help some of the 1.7 million disabled servicemen who had returned to home shores from the killing fields of the First World War.Billed as “golden ballots”, the lotteries were the first of their kind and the forerunners of the same National Lottery that continues to persuade so many of us to part with a smattering of our cash each week.\u0026nbspUnlike the modern lottery, all of the profits from Hilda Leyel’s ballots went to hospitals that specialised in the rehabilitation of the wounded of war, including prosthetic limbs, work retraining schemes and bespoke housing projects.\u0026nbspVery like the modern lottery, the winners could win life-changing prizes, from £25,000 in cash to strings of pearls – or a cow and an acre of land on which to graze it!\u0026nbspAt one of Leyel’s inaugural court hearings in April 1920, the newspaper reports of the day took great delight in pointing out that Lady Asquith, the wife of the prime minister that had taken Britain to war, had been among those present to support the accused. Furthermore, Lady Asquith was said to have shocked those present by laughing out loud when the prosecutor said that among the prizes had been the chance to dine at the Savoy Hotel in London for a week – “allowing the common chimney sweep the chance to experience the life of a Lord’’.How a British officer was worshipped as a god in 19th century IndiaWhile the society ladies of London may well have been amused by such a concept, the crown was not. Nevertheless, it did accept that the golden ballots were not the work of criminal masterminds and that none involved had personally gained from the enterprise.\u0026nbspThis was important as there were certainly some big reputations at stake. Among Leyel’s main supporters were Major-General Sir Geoffrey Feilding, who had served with distinction in the Boer War and successfully commanded an elite Coldstream Guards’ Division in the recent world war, as well as the Earl of Denbigh and Sir William Tyrrell, an assistant under-secretary of state at the Foreign Office.Ever-mindful of who they were dealing with, the prosecution remained at pains throughout to stress that it did not seek to question the honourable aims of those involved but simply wished to stop a precedent being set that would open the door to more ‘’unscrupulous’’ iniduals – people who might use such lotteries to ‘‘feather their own nests’’.In presenting Leyel with eight specimen charges, carrying a fine of £25 or three-months imprisonment each, they undoubtedly hoped that the socialite would opt to pay up and consign the enterprise to anecdote. They had, however, underestimated her fighting spirit.Created with Sketch.The best of The Independent\u0027s photography Show all 48Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Protests

HarrisThe fall of the Berlin  Wall, 1989, by Brian HarrisA storm strikes Ascot on Ladies Day, 2000, by Tom PilstonAlbanians in Korce, 1990, by Barry LewisHilda Waughton had been born in London in 1880, the daughter of a schoolmaster from the Uppingham School in Rutland. As a child she had been a keen collector of herbs and flowers and nurtured an ambition to study medicine. However, a secondary passion for acting ultimately changed that – for it was while\u0026nbspacting with the Benson Troupe that she met a young Swedish nobleman called Carl Leyel, and before the century was out the teenager and her beau had married.The Leyels went on to have two sons, both of whom were thankfully still too young to serve when war broke out in the summer of 1914. However, Hilda’s role as an actress would bring her in to contact with many of the wounded of the conflict that was slowly tearing the world apart.In the pre-war years Hilda had been an honorary treasurer of the Actresses Franchise League (AFL) established to promote female enfranchisement and suffrage via acting, education and leafleting. During the war the AFL, which neither openly supported nor condemned militancy, put its work on hold and formed Women’s Theatre Camps Entertainments. The group performed at army camps and hospitals and it is presumed that it was as a result of this work that Hilda became introduced, and then fully committed, to the care of wounded servicemen. After the war had ended she came up with the concept of the golden ballots to ensure that such men could continue to receive the aftercare and support they so desperately needed.\u0026nbspLeyel in the 1920sThe sad reality is that successive post-war governments proved themselves far from willing to take adequate responsibility for the disabled of the recent war. While pensions had improved during the conflict, and a more centralised form of care had been established by the creation of a Ministry of Pensions, few historians would argue that the state did anything other than attempt to minimise its financial support. In many ways it was able to get away with this courtesy of the sympathy of the public for the large numbers of disabled men who were providing a highly evocative and visceral presence on the streets of so many communities. In fact, by the time of the Armistice on 11 November\u0026nbsp 1918, there were already 6,000 charities registered to support injured ex-servicemen.Nevertheless, as Britain rapidly found itself slipping into a post-war depression, and money became desperately tight for many households, it proved an ever-greater challenge for the charity sector to find ways to get the public to put its hand in its pocket. The old adage that charity begins at home\u0026nbsphad never been more prescient for families living on the breadline as unemployment levels hit record highs.\u0026nbspIn addition to the difficult economic situation, the sheer number of charities operating in Britain – which had doubled to around 36,000 as a direct result of the war – meant that fundraisers were being forced to become far more professional and innovative in order to stand out from the crowd and attract donations. Many of the charitable practices that we now accept as commonplace, from the concept of professional marketing campaigns to the introduction of bespoke charity shops, can be traced back to this period.The golden ballots were, however, a genuine masterstroke. The public could take part in these ballots knowing that their money was going to support a noble cause, while\u0026nbspalso offering them the chance to become personally enriched. It’s an approach that modern descendants of the ballots, including our own National Lottery, have continued to attempt to emulate with the majority of the public’s weekly stake going to support good causes, as well as arts and heritage projects, while a handful of lucky members of the public can win life-changing amounts.Such was the fame of Hilda Leyel’s ballots, footage of the chic looking socialite can still be found in the British Pathe film archive showing her arriving on the doorstep of unsuspecting members of the public to announce their windfalls. These films were aired in cinemas across Britain, describing\u0026nbspHilda as a “fairy godmother”, and highlighting the potential backlash the crown faced in prosecuting her.Indeed, the popularity of Hilda Leyel with the public may well have been key to her decision to plead ‘’not guilty’’ to the charges levied against her and instead opt for trial by jury. It was a gamble that ultimately paid off, and her subsequent victory in the High Court in 1922 ensured that ballots held solely to raise funds for charitable causes were, from this point forward, legal. The “golden\u0026nbsplady” had changed the face of charitable fundraising in Britain for ever, making her legacy among the most socially important of the First World War.Haig. Hilda was among the honoured guests seated on the village bowling greenDespite this, the coverage in the newspapers of the flagship trial and victory was mooted. It appears that the British media, perhaps reflecting the growing public mood at the time, was keen to draw a line under ‘’the war’’\u0026nbspand focus on the brave new world\u0026nbspinstead.Likewise, when the heroine of the golden ballots died in April 1957 there was even less fanfare. In fact, she had by that time become much better known as the founder of the Society of Herbalists, the proprietor of a chain of related stores called the Culpeper Shops, and as the author of numerous popular tomes on herbalism, including the highly influential The Perfect Picnic\u0026nbspand The Gentle Art of Cookery. Never one to shy away from a battle, she would go on to find herself at the forefront of the fight to ban synthetic fertilisers.How Brexit could end 20 years of peace in Northern IrelandPages from history: The secret suffering of Ceausescu’s babies‘Now I have this thing called life’: How I beat my eating disorderTo find any formal recognition of the First World War fundraising schemes of Hilda Leyel you have to visit Lancaster, the former county town of Lancashire and the home of a rather unique settlement for disabled ex-servicemen called the Westfield War Memorial Village. This community marks its centenary in July of this year, and among the 113 homes nestled behind its grand entrance gates are a collection of four conjoined properties bearing the name of “Leyel Terrace”.The naming of the properties was how the trustees of the Westfield charity thanked Hilda for hosting a second golden ballot on their behalf in the early 1920s. Without the huge amount of money raised – which at £20,000 was in the region of a million pounds at the time – the settlement could not have grown. The money would pay for dozens of new houses, essential utilities such as sewers and pavements and a nest egg to accrue interest that would help support the community in the fallow years to follow.Such was the scale of the financial input, the lead philanthropist behind the Westfield project, Herbert Lushington Storey, would state in a formal public address in 1926: “If I may be so bold as to say so ... I am afraid if it hadn’t been for the assistance of my friend Mrs Leyel we should not have got very far with the scheme.”Mandy Stretch, the present secretary of the charity that continues to run the community, is in no doubt about the vital contribution of Hilda Leyel. She says: “As a result of the huge amount of money Hilda raised, hundreds of ex-service personnel and their families around Britain were to benefit at the end of the First World War. It shouldn’t be forgotten that many continue to benefit today. We have residents living here who have fought in nearly every conflict since the First World War – from the D-Day landings in the 1940s through to recent wars in Afghanistan – who are living in properties that were paid for by Hilda Leyel’s second Golden Ballot.”The Westfield charity will this month unveil a new memorial in recognition of the vital role that philanthropy and charity have played throughout history in the care of Britain’s disabled of war. Needless to say, at the unveiling of the memorial, special mention will be given to Hilda Leyel, the mother of two, actress, suffragist and fundraiser who risked her reputation and liberty to leave a vital and lasting mark on the whole process.Dr Martin Purdy is the historian in residence at the Westfield War Memorial Village Lancaster and the co-author of such popular First World War books as ‘Doing Our Bit’ and ‘The Gallipoli Oak’.

Four decades on from that day, believes Sean O’Grady, we may be on the cusp of a similar shift – this time to the leftClick to followThe IndependentThis lady wasn’t for turning: Margaret Thatcher back in September 1987. She came to power on 3 May 1979The story goes that Margaret Thatcher, long after she had left office, was asked what her greatest achievement had been. “Tony Blair and New Labour,” was the immediate, bright-eyed reply. By that she meant even the Labour Party had accepted the economic reconstruction of the country that began exactly four decades ago, when she won the general election of 1979. Socialism, in the sense she had fought against as a force in British politics was, if not extirpated, then certainly dormant.If the anecdote is correct, then her abiding legacy – that long-lasting Thatcherite settlement, largely accepted by Blair – lies in some jeopardy today. Jeremy Corbyn closes in on No 10 Theresa May’s pragmatic government provides a model in how not to “do politics” and there is something of a leftward shift in public opinion. Is there a sense of change in the air again?The 1979 election is counted by historians as one of the most significant of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury. The election of 1906 brought to power a Liberal government that laid the foundations for the welfare state the Labour government of 1945 made the welfare state complete with the NHS, nationalised of the “commanding heights” of the economy, and embarked on the dissolution of the British Empire and the Thatcher government elected in 1979 set about reversing much of that established but failing social democratic post-war consensus.Even at the time, the 1979 contest was granted an historic status, at least by some. For the Labour prime minister that Thatcher vanquished, James Callaghan, defeat came as no surprise.\u0026nbspHe intimated as much to one of his closest advisers, Bernard, now Lord, Donoghue near polling day, 3 May. When a rogue poll was published offering him a flicker of hope that his beleaguered government might yet win another term, Callaghan demurred: “I should not be too sure. You know, there are times, perhaps every 30 years, when there is a sea change in politics. It then does not matter what you say or what you do. There is a shift in what the public wants and what it approves of. I suspect there is now such a sea change – and it is for Thatcher.”Created with Sketch.Margaret Thatcher on the campaign trail in 1979 Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher holds her namesake, Maggie a Charolais calf, during campaigning of East AngliaMargaret Thatcher visiting a factory during her election campaignLeader of the Conservative Party, Margaret Thatcher, addressing the Tories at the start of the 1979 general election campaignConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher helping out local butcher Mr Miller during canvassingMargaret Thatcher making a telephone call in the Conservative Party coach during her election campaignConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher using a broom to sweep the grass on a visit to a hardware firm during canvassingThatcher packing Creme Eggs on a visit to the Cadbury factory in Birmingham during her election tour of BritainConservative Party leader Margaret Thatcher posing with the politicians who will make up her cabinet if they won their seats in the General Election (L-R) Angus Maude, James Prior, Humphrey Atkins, Lord Thorneycroft, Sir Keith Joseph, Lord Carrington, Francis Pym, Sir Ian Gilmour and Sir Geoffrey Howe, at her home in ChelseaMargaret Thatcher with her daughter Carol and husband Denis (behind) smiling outside their home as Carol is welcomed back from Australia to help with her mothers election campaign in Chelsea, London, April 23rd 1979.

From left Nigel Davenport, Molly Weir, Liz Fraser, Pete Murray, Vince Hill and LuluConservative MP and new Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, arriving at No.10 Downing Street after winning the General Election and defeating the Labour Party under James CallaghanIn 2019 we are, theoretically, due another “watershed” election (or referendum) –\u0026nbspperhaps undoing the historic commitment to Europe and what Maggie put in place.I remember the day Thatcher arrived in Downing Street very well, watching those famous scenes of her on the steps of Downing Street on the BBC Nine O’Clock News – no rolling news channels in those days (and we’d only just got a colour TV set). Her words – a prayer by St Francis of Assisi –\u0026nbspstruck me then, and still today, as such a strange choice, promising the kind of national reconciliation that such a combative politician was unlikely to want to deliver: “Where there is discord, may we bring harmony. Where there is error, may we bring truth. Where there is doubt, may we bring faith. And where there is despair, may we bring hope.”It was much assumed at the time, especially in the Labour Party (of which I was then a precocious member), that this apparition of Victorian values would soon be kicked out of office. Thatcher’s insane economic experiments with monetarism, mass unemployment and defeating the unions would fail spectacularly, it was confidently predicted.After all, in 1970 her immediate Conservative predecessor, Edward Heath, had also been elected on a programme of radical market-driven change, resolving to tame the trades unions. After little more than three years of battling unsuccessfully he was thrown out of office in an election called, ironically enough, on the slogan “Who governs Britain?” –\u0026nbspmeaning him or the coal miners’ union, the NUM. “Not you, mate,” was the electorate’s reply.Having suffered power cuts, a state of emergency, a three-day working week and what he himself described as “a harder Christmas than we have known since the war”, Heath’s defeat seemed to prove that the UK would not be ruled without the consent of the trades unions.Why wouldn’t\u0026nbspThatcher also come a cropper?\u0026nbsp No reason, except that, in the intervening years the unions had abused their position even more. This time they had broken a Labour administration headed by a man, Callaghan, who was once a trade union official himself (for the white-collar Inland Revenue Staff Federation), and prided himself on close links with the union “barons”. Thus the myth that the UK could be governed only with the agreement of the unions – which meant the Labour Party –\u0026nbspwas broken instead the choice was whether the nation wished to be governed by the unions or not.It is difficult at this distance to appreciate the scale of union power in the Britain of the 1970s. They could make or break governments of any party, and they did. They defied parliament.\u0026nbspThe Winter of Discontent in 1978-79 offered plenty of material for\u0026nbspThatcher, for the anti-union press (then more powerful and just as vicious) and for the average British citizen to believe something had gone badly wrong with the way the country was run.Corbyn aims to put unions back on top – we should be terrifiedIt is a lost world. The strikers – many pathetically poorly paid – refused to work because the government tried to run a “pay policy”, attempting to limit the rise in wages across every worker in the economy to, at that time, 5 per cent in a year.\u0026nbspThatcher, of course, promised an end to the farce.When Callaghan returned to freezing Britain, tanned from an international summit in Guadeloupe, he proffered the opinion that most people around the world would not share the view that there was mounting chaos. The out-of-touch complacency was, if inaccurately, devastatingly reflected in a telling Sun headline: “Crisis? What Crisis?”Everyone seemed to be on strike – municipal workers such as school caretakers, “bin men” and “dinner ladies” (I use the antique terms deliberately), NHS ancillary workers, ambulance drivers, lorry drivers, petrol tanker drivers, print workers, car workers, bakers. The scenes of black bags of rubbish strewn around streets would haunt Labour for years. Schools and petrol stations closed, hospitals allowed emergencies only, meals on wheels stopped.Daily Mail could justifiably run the headline: “Now they won’t let us bury our dead!”There was plenty to be disillusioned by and only one politician provided much hope, real or imagined, about the future.The cabinet pondered how to get “blackleg” strike-breaking grave diggers past the cemetery gates and through the mass picketing – a riot at a funeral would have been all the papers needed to hang the ultimate shame around the neck of Callaghan and his hapless ministers.By 1979, then, the unions were resented for their abuse of power. Combined with the activities\u0026nbspof the IRA\u0026nbsp(who assassinated Airey Neave MP, one of Thatcher’s closest friends, and Lord Mountbatten that year), as well as occasional violence from the political extremes, many commentators were asking whether Britain was governable. Books came out with titles such as Britain in Agony.Routinely the UK was ranked as the “sick man of Europe”, a visibly decaying, grey, grim land of strikes and failing public services. Things simply didn’t work. You’d wait six months to have a landline installed by the nationalised Post Office Telephones. The railways under British Rail were a loss-making mess, infamous for inedible sandwiches and filthy, elderly rolling stock. The British Steel Corporation, the National Coal Board, National Express, the National Bus Company, British Shipbuilders, British Leyland, the Royal Mail, British Airways and various other nationalised industries, owned and subsidised by the taxpayer, sometimes lost millions a week.Saatchi and Saatchi’s classic 1978 posterThe only growth industries in the country were North Sea oil – there by accident – and punk rock. Then, as now, there was some sentiment that immigration was too high, with the far right taking advantage (though\u0026nbspThatcher succeeded in attracting and neutralising much of the National Front’s appeal when she made a – probably –\u0026nbspcalculated “gaffe” about people feeling “swamped” in some communities). Every year the stagnant British economy fell further behind living standards in France and Germany. Sterling was almost continually on the slide.We had Morecambe and Wise, but Britain was not a happy place.\u0026nbspThe social democratic paradise that Labour and Conservative governments had tried to build since 1945, based on consensus around the welfare state, progressive taxation, a commitment to full employment and Keynesian demand management of the economy, had collapsed.The nation was bust. In 1976 we had to ask the IMF for a loan, mortgaged on North Sea oil, because no one in the real world – the Americans, the Germans, the Japanese, the pension funds – was willing to lend money to HM Government. It was humiliating. Comprehensive education, high rise council blocks, local government reform, decimalisation, Concorde (an expensive commercial flop), the Jeremy Thorpe affair, the social security system – all were lesser but potent sources of disappointment for voters. There was plenty to be disillusioned by and only one politician provided much hope, real or imagined, about the future.That was why\u0026nbspThatcher won the election – it was the end of an era, and the voters realised it. In a phrase she was later to make her own, the feeling in 1979 was that “there is no alternative”. Thatcher enjoyed the best advice in public relations the Saatchi and Saatchi “Labour Isn’t Working” poster of 1978 remains classic.She even had the first “battle bus” fitted with a private radio-telephone. (It stopped working when the bus went under a low bridge and the aerial was knocked off.) More than all that, though, she won the argument, based on the evidence surrounding every voter that past policies had failed and would fail again.Her manifesto was a model in travelling light – few specifics, plenty of aspiration. To restore the health of our economic and social life. To restore incentives so that hard work pays, success is rewarded and genuine new jobs are created in an expanding economy. To uphold parliament and the rule of law.Yet in opposition from 1975 to 1979, Thatcher, whose only top job had been education secretary, was regarded as strident, extreme and unproven, always lagging behind prime minister Callaghan in the personal ratings. Callaghan succeeded (in those sexist days) in patronising her as “the little lady” who would one day learn the ways of the world.The Thatcher revolution, in other words, was far from pre-ordained. What made the difference was that sea change in the public mood. Before that, in the autumn of 1978, there was talk of Sunny Jim cashing in on relatively subdued inflation and a pickup in economic growth and prosperity. He chose not to, gambling on a better 1979, and failed in the most spectacular manner possible.Are we ready for another sea change in 2019? It is entertaining to speculate what\u0026nbspThatcher would have made of Jeremy Corbyn (and they did overlap as MPs from his arrival in the Commons in 1983 to her departure in 1992). She might well have rather liked him, as she had a soft spot for those she recognised as fellow “conviction” politicians, even if they were of the left.Figures such as Michael Foot, Tony Benn and, especially, Eric Heffer earned her respect and even affection she openly despised Neil Kinnock, who moved from a sports-jacketed soft lefty unilateralist into a dark blue-suited centrist almost as soon as he had won leadership on the back of his supposed socialist credentials. Corbyn she would no doubt have thought was a man who followed the dictum of her beloved father, Alderman Roberts of Grantham, who taught her never to change her opinions just because it was fashionable to do so.Pym, Sir Ian Gilmour and (far right) Sir Geoffrey Howe\u0026nbsp(Getty)\u0026nbspIn a way you can, apart from the last bit, almost imagine Corbyn making parts of the speech Thatcher made in the 1979 campaign on a visit to Swansea: “I am a conviction politician. The Old Testament prophets didn’t merely say, ‘Brothers, I want consensus.’ They said, ‘This is my faith and vision. This is what I passionately believe. If you believe it too, then come with me.’ Tonight I say to you just that.”Corbyn is hardly the smart, skilful, often shrewd and careful politician Thatcher usually was, but he has more in common with the Iron Lady than the vacillating, managerial civil servant manque Theresa May, who might be thought a more obvious parallel. Indeed May, presiding over a minority government habitually suffering defeats and relying on a pact with a smaller party, resembles Callaghan quite closely. The next sea change may be for Corbyn, conviction politician, if it has not already hit us through Brexit.A further personal note, if I may. In 1979, as I watched Thatcher winning what was to be the first of three successive general elections, I felt two things. First, this woman means business.The Huawei row reminds me of one of Thatcher’s infamous bust upsMay and Corbyn face Brexit backlash after election lossesCorbyn ally says Labour trying to ‘bail out’ Tories over BrexitSecond, I surmised, she will probably be around for longer than the Labour Party seem to think. So it proved. I was 17 when she came to power and 35 when Blair finally evicted John Major’s fag-end Conservatives from government – a fact that never fails to stun.Looking back from the 21st\u0026nbspcentury, which in 1979 was still a matter of science fiction, we can see just how necessary most of her reforms were to make the economy work again, raise productivity, make new technology and new enterprise a possibility, and attract inward investment to a land where management could manage their businesses without being taxed to pay for lame ducks. Even so, unless you had money, the Thatcher years certainly weren’t much fun at the time, and some of us could see that pain coming.I look towards the Corbyn sea change, if that’s what it is, with no less trepidation than I did the Thatcher revolution, and with considerably less hope that the sacrifices to\u0026nbspbe made will be worth it.I certainly pray we will not have to relearn the lessons so harshly learned in the 1970s, then relive the remedies of the 1980s. We really don’t want to go through all that again.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Similar strikes are taking place around the world today including in Japan and Australia, inspired by 16-year-old Greta Thunberg who criticised world leaders at a United Nations climate conferenceThere have also been strong concerns raised over the past year at the rate at which communities are losing easy access to cash amid bank branch and ATM closures.Research from Which? found this week that fees of at least 95p per withdrawal were imposed on nearly 1,700 ATMs between January and March.Some 2.2 million people are estimated to be almost entirely reliant on cash in their daily lives, with the elderly, vulnerable and those in rural communities likely to be hardest hit by a decline.The Treasury said the plans will complement work to support digital payment methods which continue to revolutionise and expand the ways people manage their money.New Royal Mint coins mark 200th anniversary of Queen Victoria’s birthMr Hammond said: “Technology has transformed banking for millions of people, making it easier and quicker to carry out financial transactions and pay for services.“But it’s also clear that many people still rely on cash and I want the public to have choice over how they spend their money.“I’m also setting up a group which brings together the Treasury, Bank of England and the regulators to safeguard the future of cash and ensure its availability for years to come.”Natalie Ceeney, chair\u0026nbspof the Access to Cash review, which recently described the cash system as “on the verge of collapse”, said: “Cash use is falling rapidly, but digital payments don’t yet work for everyone.“We need to safeguard the use of cash for those who need it, and at the same time work hard to ensure that everyone can participate in the digital economy.“If we sleepwalk into a cashless society, millions of people will be left behind.“I’m delighted to see the government taking a leadership role on this critical issue, and look forward to seeing action as a result.”As well as establishing the Joint Authorities Cash Strategy Group (Jacs) – chaired by the Treasury and bringing together regulators – the government said it will also:– Support the Bank of England’s work to develop a new wholesale cash distribution system to ensure cash is being distributed as needed across the country– Develop a coin checking and validation framework to remove counterfeits from circulation and stop them from ending up in people’s pockets– Continue to support new digital methods of payment while safeguarding access to cash for those who need itThe government said more than £2bn has been invested since 2010 in the Post Office network to support customers in accessing banking services.Currently, 99 per cent of personal customers and 95 per cent\u0026nbspof small business customers can carry out their everyday banking locally at one of the Post Office’s 11,500 branches.ATM network Link has committed to replacing\u0026nbspclosed machines in rural or remote areas when there is no free ATM within a kilometre or Post Office branch available.Link has also recently implemented new “super premiums” to further safeguard free-to-use ATMs in remote and deprived areas.David Chaplin, head of campaigns at Which?, said: “Millions of people across the UK who rely on cash in their daily lives are currently at risk of being stripped of their ability to pay for essential goods and services – so the government’s unprecedented commitment to protecting cash should finally offer them some reassurance.“This new body must act urgently to address rapid changes to the cash landscape, as its success will be judged by how it ensures people can continue to access their preferred payment method in the face of bank branch and cashpoint closures, intermittent broadband access and regular IT glitches affecting digital payment methods.”Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair\u0026nbspMike Cherry said: “The chancellor has shown he is listening to the small business community today.“We called for the appointment of an expert group dedicated to protecting free access to cash and that’s exactly what is now being delivered.“Millions of small business owners have customers that still want to pay in cash.”He continued: “Keeping 1p and 2p coins in circulation is the right call. The freedom to use pennies is still important to a lot of small firms.“For many, being able to charge prices that end in 99p rather than a round pound figure can be enough to tip intrigue into a sale, particularly where lower-value items are concerned.”Nicky Morgan, chair\u0026nbspof the Treasury Committee, said: “The new Jacs\u0026nbspgroup is a welcome step, but the government must ensure that it implements the Access to Cash Review’s recommendations urgently, and in full, to protect access to cash.“Additionally, HM Treasury should undertake an analysis of the incidence of shops and other service providers not accepting cash, and the chancellor should make cash policy an explicit responsibility of the relevant Treasury minister.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But it has revealed next to nothing about what exactly went wrong.Now\u0026nbspHans\u0026nbspKoenigsmann, vice president of flight reliability for SpaceX, admitted that there had been an anomaly. But the company continued to be tight-lipped about the details of the problem.The April 20 accident occurred on a landing zone at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station as SpaceX was conducting a test of emergency thrusters designed to propel the capsule, dubbed Crew Dragon, to safety from atop the rocket in the event of a launch failure.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s most stunning pictures of space Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An image from Nasa\u0027s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) shows a 200,000 mile long solar filament ripping through the Sun\u0027s corona in September 2013230 Nasa Celebrates 50 Years of SpacewalkingFor 50 years, NASA has been suiting up for spacewalking.

There were no injuries. SpaceX had taken all safety measures prior to this test, as we always do.The news conference was called ahead of Friday\u0027s scheduled launch of an unmanned resupply mission to the international space station using a cargo-only capsule built by SpaceX, the private rocket venture of billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk.When pressed, Koenigsmann declined to characterise the nature of the accident, including whether an explosion or fire was involved. NASA has likewise demurred when asked to describe the mishap.A leaked video of the accident, which was acknowledged as authentic by a NASA contractor in an internal memo obtained by the Orlando Sentinel newspaper, showed the astronaut capsule blasting into smithereens. A pall of smoke was also widely observed rising over the launch pad from a distance at the time of the ill-fated test.The Crew Dragon had been scheduled to carry US\u0026nbspastronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley to the International Space Station in a test mission in July, although the recent accident, as well as some other hitches in the vehicle\u0027s design, are likely to push that schedule to later in the year or into 2020.It\u0027s certainly not great news for the schedule overall, but I hope we can recover, Koenigsmann said.The destroyed vehicle was one of six such capsules built or in late production by SpaceX, and the first flown into space. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched it without crew to the space station in March for a six-day visit before returning to Earth, splashing down safely in the Atlantic for retrieval.We have no reason to believe there is an issue with the SuperDracos themselves, Koenigsmann said, adding that the engines have been tested nearly 600 times in the past.NASA has been awarded $6.8bn to SpaceX and rival Boeing Co to develop separate capsule systems to fly astronauts to space, but both companies have faced technical challenges and delays.Additional reporting by ReutersBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And that really hurts. So it was really emotional knowing I’ve got to walk away.”Mr Kelly, who lives in Bermagui, New South Wales, launched a campaign to reclaim the shield in 2016 after he saw it had been loaned\u0026nbspto Canberra’s National Museum of Australia.\u0026nbspHe said he grew up listening to stories about his ancestors from the period of Britiain’s arrival in Australia, and traced his family tree to discover he is a direct descendent of the warrior who was killed. \u0026nbspThe dream now, he said, was to get it back home in time for the 250th anniversary of it being taken.He added the shield represents the\u0026nbspBritish colonisation of Australia, and how they “never respected us as human beings when they opened fire and took everything”.He said people at home were keen to learn about their roots and the shield was a major symbol of the past that could help teach them.\u0026nbspHow an Aboriginal approach to mental health is helping farmersAboriginal teen makes history for reaching Miss World Australia Finals“They’re all just asking me ‘When are they coming back? Can you bring them back yet?’”But he said the British Museum Act is one of the reasons why the institute is refusing to return the shield.\u0026nbspA report by Sarah Keenan,\u0026nbspsenior professor at Birkbeck Law School, claims the British Museum “changed its story” about the origins of the Gweagal Shield when a two-day workshop to “test the argument the shield was collected at Botany bay in 1770” led\u0026nbspparticipants to argue\u0026nbspit is not from Cook’s landing.\u0026nbspMr Kelly said repatriation was important in light of “all the stuff that’s happened in the past” and it would be a “huge moment in time to have the British Museum and others actually return things to the Aboriginal people because it would be a great step towards the healing process.”He added ancestral spears taken by Cook and his men at the same time\u0026nbspwere held at the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge\u0026nbsphe also viewed those privately last year.Mr Kelly’s claim to the artefacts has been backed by a motion passed in 2016 by New South Wales’ parliament, which acknowledged his clan as the shield’s rightful owners\u0026nbspAustralia’s Senate followed suit two months later. \u0026nbspAustralian historian Keith Vincent Smith told The Independent: “I can certainly say the Gweagal at Botany Bay are the rightful owners of the shield and spears taken from there by Joseph Banks and James Cook in 1770.” \u0026nbspIn a paper entitled Confronting Cook, Mr Smith describes how information about Cooman was passed down through generations, after\u0026nbspan Aboriginal woman’s account of what happened was documented in the 1840s.He said the shield is likely to be the same as the one seen in drawings from the time.Mr Kelly, who is visiting the UK for the fourth time in collaboration with pressure group BP Or Not BP? said he was amazed at what was on display at the British Museum.\u0026nbspDuring last year’s visit he said he took part in the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour’ to protest a controversial BP-sponsored exhibition of Iraqi artefacts. This week, he leads the group’s ‘British Museum Stolen Goods Tour: Colonialism, Carbon \u0026amp Cook” with speakers discussing “looted items” on display from\u0026nbspIraq, Palestine, Greece and Australia.\u0026nbspHe said: “For me, this tour is all about getting different cultures together because we’re all in it for that one cause. I think it’s a great opportunity for us to unite and to show the British People and British Museum there’s a real need for these items to be repatriated and we can make the world a better place if we did.”Created with Sketch.

That is what happened to Labour last night,” said David Lammy, a Labour MP in London.“We fudged and hedged on a people’s vote, hoping we could string voters along, but the bluff has been called.”Phil Wilson, a northeast MP, said: “The lesson for Labour is don’t sit on the fence. Show leadership and support a confirmatory ballot.”Created with Sketch.Put It To The People march: Best of The Independent’s pictures Show all 24Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Margaret Hodge, another London MP, tweeted: “Election Lesson 1: if you don’t give people something to vote for then they will not vote for you.”And Owen Smith, a Wales MP and former leadership contender, said: “Our reward for bailing the Tories out on Brexit was to share the losses with them – to Lib Dems, Greens and others who are clear that they oppose Brexit.”The comment followed an extraordinary TV claim by Barry Gardiner, the shadow business secretary, that Labour was “trying to bail out” the Tories in order to deliver Brexit.The party lost a famous face when Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick in the Blackadder series, announced he was quitting after 45 years over “duplicity on Brexit”, antisemitism and “because its leadership is complete s***”.But a defiant Mr Corbyn vowed to continue to seek a Brexit agreement, saying: “A deal has to be done, parliament has got to resolve this issue, I think that is very, very clear.”Many dismissed the swings to pro-EU parties as a traditional protest, which went to those parties in the absence of the Brexit Party and with Ukip too toxic, or simply not standing.However, Labour Remainers fear an even worse performance in the European elections in a fortnight, after Mr Corbyn crushed an attempt to commit him to a referendum on any Brexit deal.Voters furious about Brexit spoil their local election ballot papers Local election results could push May and Corbyn into a Brexit pactTories and Labour suffer Brexit fallout as voters turn elsewhereFarage confirms Brexit Party to contest Peterborough by-electionMay says students ‘priced out’ of EU by Brexit are better off in UKCross-party talks will resume on Tuesday, after the prime minister admitted she was ready to strike a deal\u0026nbspwith Labour based around a form of customs union.But the election results also provoked fresh trauma in the Tory party – which has even greater cause to fear the Euro polls, faced with a resurgent Nigel Farage at the head of his new Brexit Party.In extraordinarily candid comments, Sajid Javid, the home secretary, warned his “ided party” was set to lose power, while foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted to “a slap in the face”.Brexiteers Priti Patel, Bernard Jenkin and Crispin Blunt repeated their calls for the prime minister to resign, while David Amess – until now a May backer – demanded the party move against her “immediately”.The Tories lost around 40 councils and suffered in true-blue heartlands in the south, including Chelmsford, Somerset and Ms May’s backyard of Windsor and Maidenhead, where a majority of 38 was slashed to just five.Speaking at a Tory conference in Wales, the prime minister blamed the Brexit crisis, saying: “There was a simple message from yesterday’s elections to both us and the Labour Party – just get on and deliver Brexit.”Strikingly, many voters used the elections to physically register their protest at the state of politics, sharing images of voting slips with messages including ‘Get May out’, ‘Brexit betrayal’ and ‘Traitors’ written across them.Explaining why he spoiled his ballot, one Worcester voter said: “The major parties have been lying for three years straight about Brexit and, in a two-party system, neither of them deserve to be voted for at any level.”There were huge number of spoiled ballots in Great Yarmouth (968), Swindon (825), Basildon (796), Folkestone and Hythe (637), Tendring (600) and North Norfolk (563).The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Do they want Ms May’s deal, do they want to have Brexit without a period of transition, or do they want to stay in the European Union?”Speaking in Wales, the prime minister blamed the Brexit crisis for the Tory\u0027s poll failure, saying: “There was a simple message from yesterday\u0027s elections to both us and the Labour Party – just get on and deliver Brexit.”But the heckler, Stuart Davies, a Tory member and former councillor, demanded she quit. “I am furious at what she has done to our party. To put it bluntly, she is telling lies”, he said, pointing out she had said that the Uk would leave the EU on 29 March.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At the moment, the arithmetic in the House of Commons is opposed to leaving without a deal.”He warned that “whoever succeeds Theresa” would inherit her difficulties, unless the Brexit crisis was resolved first.Hunt accused of having ‘head in the clouds’ over royal plane ideaTory wins council seat by single ballot scrawled with word ‘Brexit’Corbyn ally says Labour trying to ‘bail out’ Tories over BrexitDavid Gauke, the justice secretary, said: “I am confident that Theresa May is the right person to lead us through this process.“We have got to deliver phase one of leaving the European Union and the idea we should be changing the leader before we do that is not something that I think would be sensible.”And Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said: “I don’t think changing the leadership would mean a change to the arithmetic.”The government had to “find a majority that will work”, either with Labour or by having “talks with others and having further votes in the Commons”.But Sir Hugo said the Tories had no time to waste, after suffering their worst local elections day since the dog days of John Major\u0027s government in 1995.“These are challenging times for Conservatives and we now urgently need a new leader to reinvigorate the party if we are to prevent an extreme left-wing government that will bring this country to its knees,” he tweeted.Ms May is expected to renew her efforts to strike a cross-party deal with Jeremy Corbyn, hoping to force it through the Commons by the end of June.It is too late to prevent the European elections taking place on 23 May\u0026nbspbut Brexit could still be delivered in time to prevent MEPs actually taking their seats in July.However, there is huge opposition to such a deal – based on a form of customs union – in both main parties.Vote of no confidenceThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But, as the overall results show, the victories were eclipsed by heavy losses elsewhere.\u0026nbspSome of the biggest defeats were in its former Essex and Lincolnshire heartlands: it parted with seven seats on Thurrock council and 12 in Boston.Ukip is now polling just around five per cent for the coming European Parliament elections – a contest it won with 26.6 per cent of the vote just five years ago.By contrast the Brexit party hit 30 per cent in one recent survey, more than any other party. If the same showing is replicated on results day, Ukip would struggle to remain even one MEP.Created with Sketch.Farage launches his new Brexit Party: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Nigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyNigel Farage speaks at the launch of his new Brexit Party\u0027s campaign for the European electionsBrexit Party candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg, sister of Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, speaks at the launchA supporter waits for Farage to speakSupporters wait for Farage to speakFarage and prospective candidate Annunziata Rees-Mogg wait at the launchSupporters listen as Farage speaksFree T-shirts for all attendees Posters on the seats for supporters of the Brexit PartyUkip has struggled to hold onto local government seats in recent elections, despite making quite substantial gains in the 2010-15 parliament.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspOverall the Conservatives were the biggest loser of the night, shedding at least 970\u0026nbsplosses according to the tally as of 4.30pm on Friday.

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.The monetary policy committee\u0026nbspsaid in the minutes to its rate-setting meeting: “GDP is expected to have grown by 0.5 per cent\u0026nbspin the first quarter, in part a reflection of a larger-than-expected boost from companies in the United Kingdom and the European Union building stocks ahead of recent Brexit deadlines. That boost is expected to be temporary, however, and quarterly growth is expected to slow to around 0.2 per cent in the second quarter.”Stock-building during the period had been higher than expected, with UK manufacturing output rising markedly during the first two months of\u0026nbsp2019. Imports of goods from EU and non-EU countries both rose by around 3 per cent\u0026nbspduring the quarter. The pound was broadly flat after the rate announcement, which was in line with traders’ expectations.Erik Norland, senior economist at CME Group, said: “Both the pound and UK interest rates are still stuck in a tug of war between a strong employment market and wage growth, which ordinarily would pull them higher, and a soft housing market, weak exports and falling consumer confidence, which are pulling in the opposite direction. \u0026nbsp“Mixed economic indicators, combined with the continuing uncertainty regarding Brexit, are keeping the BoE and markets on hold. That said, if parliament seals the deal to leave the European Union\u0026nbspit will likely send the pound significantly higher and nudge interest rate expectations in the direction of further rate hikes later this year.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The oil-rich country is plagued with economic and political turmoil – with hyperinflation leaving the currency practically worthless and causing the cost of essentials to skyrocket, leaving many unable to afford basics such as food and medicine.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

If it fails, it could be seen as evidence that he lacks the support he says he has. It might also encourage the authorities, which have already stripped him of parliamentary immunity and opened multiple investigations into him, to arrest him.In January Mr Guaido, the leader of\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s opposition-controlled National Assembly invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing that Mr\u0026nbspMaduro’s re-election in 2018 was illegitimate.The United States was among some 50 countries that recognise Mr Guaido as\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s president, and\u0026nbspimposed sanctions to try to dislodge Mr Maduro, but the president has so far clung to power.Donald Trump has yet to comment on the uprising, although the White House confirmed he was “monitoring the ongoing situation and secretary of state Mike Pompeo\u0026nbspsaid the US government “fully supports” Mr Guaido’s call for military backing.A former US\u0026nbspofficial said that while it was unclear of Mr Guaido’s efforts would trigger a broader military uprising, it appeared aimed at building momentum towards mass protests planned for Wednesday.Mr\u0026nbspGuaido has said the May Day demonstrations “the largest march in\u0026nbspVenezuela‘s history” and\u0026nbsppart of the “definitive phase” of his effort to take office in order to call fresh elections.Mr Maduro has accused Mr Guaido of being a\u0026nbspUS-backed puppet who seeks to oust him in a coup. The government has arrested Mr Guaido’s top aide, stripped him of his parliamentary immunity and opened multiple probes. It has also barred him from leaving the country, a ban Mr Guaido openly violated earlier this year.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Japan ranks lowest among countries with a population exceeding 40 million, followed by South Korea at 12.9 per cent\u0026nbspand Italy and Germany at 13.4 per cent, according to the Statistics Bureau figures.As of 2017, Japanese women on average gave birth to 1.43 children during their lifetimes. That compares with nearly 1.8 in the US and Britain.Japan’s deputy PM apologises after blaming women for low birthratesAccording to the latest government statistics, the number of births in 2018 fell to 921,000, the lowest since Japan began recording such statistics in 1899.Japan’s total population fell by 448,000 people, a record decline, to 126 million.The population is forecast to fall below 100 million by 2050, barring a huge influx of immigrants.Japan last month started allowing more foreign workers to ease a labour crunch.Prime minister Shinzo Abe has said ageing and the low birth rate are a national crisis. He has promised labour and other reforms to help alleviate the burden on families that discourage couples from having more children.Longer life s in Japan have added to rising costs for elderly care and social security.Conservative legislators in Mr Abe’s government have at times blamed the elderly or childless for long-term demographic trends.Gaffe-prone finance minister Taro Aso\u0026nbsphad to\u0026nbspapologise earlier this year\u0026nbspfor saying childless people are to blame for Japan’s rising social security costs and declining population.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s like listening to somebody whisper a word in a busy cafe it can be difficult to make out the word or even to be sure that the person whispered at all. It will take some time to reach a conclusion about this candidate.”Ligo and Virgo were switched on again on 1 April after a period of upgrades.How scientists created the first ever image of a black holeThey work by picking up tiny ripples in the fabric of space that are fired out across the universe when two massive objects collide.The new detection, on 26 April, came just a day after the system had identified a cataclysmic merger of two neutron stars about 500 million light years from earth.Giovanni Prodi, data analysis coordinator with Virgo and a professor at the University of Trento, described the two incidents as making the period an “incomparable scientific month”.University of Wisconsin-MilwaukeeUniversity of TrentoOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Or they can pay fidyah, a religious term for donation of food or money.Muslim children are expected to begin fasting once they have reached puberty, usually by the age of .There is no national law that prevents young children or teens from fasting.The NHS does advise against children as young as seven or eight fasting.Advice from the national health body read: Its a good idea to make children aware of what fasting involves and to practice fasting for a few hours at a time.Ramadan shts according to the movement of the moon.Islamic Relief has formed a timetable with all the signicant times Muslims in London must remember from the beginning of Ramadan - due to start on Sunday, May .Muslims will be expected to abstain from food and drink between sunrise and sunset for  days.Usually adults will have a meal just before dawn, and another after sunset.At the end of the fast, when the sun has gone down, family and friends will get together for Iftar to break their fast.The guide shows the time of sunriseand the time for Iftar.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a scammer.The conman first made contact with her via a Facebook fan page dedicated to Derbyshire-born Jason who moved to LA about  years ago.“I thought, ‘Oh, that’s nice of him, talking to his fans’. I might have been star-struck then, I don’t know,” says the anonymous victim. Once she was hooked in, the messages rapidly escalated to “Jason” telling her he loved her and that, surprise surprise, he was having some financial dficulties and needed help because a film payment had been delayed.He added, and I write this verbatim: “I really need you to do this for me honey I can’t trust anyone but you with my money honey.”At this point, did alarm bells ring that she was, in fact, ­conversing with the Hunny ­Monster  Nope, seems not.So, over a period of time, she sent “a substantial amount which would have made a dference to my le and my family”.I’m torn between sympathy and utter disbelief that someone could be so naive.Online fraud is now an epidemic and plenty have lost money in scams so sophisticated that even the most tech-savvy would struggle to spot them.It’s a world away from the ­early-day scams of someone in Nigeria claiming to have a ­fortune locked away in an account they can only accessyou can just send £squillion right now.But what of “Jason Statham” and his like or, worse, the ones who frequent dating sites in the hope of carrying out their sting in person Barely a week goes by when we don’t read a story of someone who thought they had met the partner of their dreams . . . only to discover, several thousand pounds and a whole lot of heartbreak later, that they weren’t who they claimed to be.It goes without saying that loss or loneliness can sometimes make us throw caution to the wind in our search for love.But common sense must always be preserved.FORMER principal ballet dancer Dame Gillian Lynne has left £.million in her will.A robust fortune garnered from her role as choreographer for smash-hit musicals such as Cats and Phantom Of The Opera.Gillian’s path to success is a salutary lesson for anyone currently despairing that their child is struggling at school.When Gillian was young, her mother was concerned about her lack of concentration, and therefore progress, in lessons.So she took her daughter to see a child behavioural specialist who, after a few routine questions, switched on the radio and told Gillian that he and her mother were going to step outside for a while.Once in the corridor, they peeped through the window and watched as Gillian started moving to the music.“There’s nothing wrong with your daughter,” he concluded. “She’s a dancer. Take her to dance school.”Sadly, around  years on, the State still fails to understand that creativity is as important as literacy in giving kids the best chance of a happy, successful adulthood.When you have a spare  minutes, watch Sir Ken Robinson’s TED talk asking: “Do schools kill creativity ”They can, and plenty do. And until the Government changes the education system, thousands of bored, disenfranchised kids will fail in it.WHILE sightseeing in Japan, Ed Sheeran bizarrely chose a full panda outfit in a bid to go incognito.But when he briefly removed it in a store, a fan clocked him and asked for a selfie .Still, nice to see that Ed recovered from the ordeal in time to run the London Marathon.What a showbiz trouper he is.BRITISH-born Michael Adebowale is the evil brute who killed and tried to decapitate soldier Lee Rigby in broad daylight.He is currently residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure in HMP Wakefield – aka “Monster Mansion” – where other lags see him as a top target, and he’s feeling an ickle bit scared, poor lamb.Consequently, he has asked for advice on how to move to a cushier jail in his parents’ home country of Nigeria.The answer, of course, should be a firm no.In the meantime, how refreshing to hear of a ­ruthless killer experiencing jail time that ­actually feels like a ­punishment for his heinous crime.WHEN it launched in , Instagram rapidly became the go-to place for those who wanted to “filter the s**t”out of their everyday lives.Suddenly, no one had any blemishes, they all resembled Elle Macpherson in a bikini and even their cofed and slightly startled dog looked like it had just stepped off the winner’s podium at Crufts.It became known as “Instasham” and, along with other social media sites, took a hefty share of blame for the worrying increase in poor self-esteem among young girls who felt they couldn’t match up to the images of perfection being posted by their idols.Now, riding the waves of a welcome sea change in attitude, media-savvy social media “influencers” are falling over themselves to show how imperfect they are.“Just woken up” selfies with no make-up are a favourite, along with close-ups of spots, stretch marks, cellulite, and tummy rolls . . . all with earnest captions reminding us that we’re not all ­perfect.Undoubtedly, it is a well-meaning step towards helping their young fans realise that whatever face or body you’re born with, it’s better to work at loving who you are and not what you look like.But surely, true progress is when a visible blemish tummy roll stretch mark is deemed so normal that it doesn’t even warrant comment Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its author is not your standard liberal conscience, ­cloistered in Whitehall or a university sociology department.  Baroness Helen Newlove knows only too well what it is like to be a victim of crime.Twelve years ago she was an ordinary mum living in a suburb of Warrington, Cheshire, when her husband left their home to confront a group of drunken youths who were vandalising his car. He never ed.He was kicked and beaten so savagely that he later died in hospital.What was especially galling for his we and three daughters was that the three youths responsible —  who were each jailed for le — had been the ­subject of numerous complaints.One of those jailed for Garry’s murder had already been on an assault charge but had been released on bail just a few hours earlier to resume his le ­terrorising local residents.Neither police, prosecutors nor the courts seemed to appreciate just how far out of control the youths had become.They failed to put together numerous complaints of antisocial behaviour to see the overall picture. As a result, the problem was allowed to escalate to its murderous conclusion.Sadly, to judge by Baroness Newlove’s report, too little has changed in the years since her first husband’s ­murder. Still, she says, police are treating complaints about anti- social behaviour as isolated incidents, each dismissed as “low-level crime”.A vandalised car is treated as a problem to be sorted out with an insurance claim.  Youths riding motorbikes round a children’s playground might be challenged by police on one ­occasion but it is never followed up.  Dope-smoking seems effectively to have been legalised, the police ­having all but given up even speaking to those involved. At the same time, incidents of antisocial behaviour are  rising sharply.Last year,  per cent of people responding to the British Crime Survey — an annual poll of more than , randomly-selected Britons — reported witnessing antisocial behaviour, up from . per cent the year before.This wasn’t how it was supposed to be.In  the Government introduced what it called a “community trigger” — which was supposed to give residents the right to demand greater actionthree or more separate reports on antisocial behaviour were received within a six-month period.Residents can demand a “case review”, at which the authorities must explain what action they intend to take.Yet in half of local authority areas, says Newlove, the community trigger process was not used during  .Newlove also has a gripe with the police  service — the non-emergency number introduced in .  It was ­supposed to encourage us to report non-le-threatening incidents for which we might be reluctant to call .But, as I found from my own experience, it seems to be used as a means of fobbing us off.When I came across someone stealing from a pile of wood by the roadside I rang the number —  but it took ages to have the call answered and even when it was, nothing  happened, even though I had taken down the registration plate of the thieves’  vehicle.To cap the insult, while  calls are free it costs p to call .Of course, police can’t be expected to deal with and solve every single crime. I know that officer numbers have fallen and that in some areas they are struggling with an epidemic of kne murders, which obviously needs to take priority.Butyou give people the impression that you are no longer even bothering to try to police “low-level” crime, you are just inviting the problem to escalate.It isn’t just the police, however, who are responsible for the lack of action on antisocial behaviour. Local authorities have filled their town centres with enforcement officers, who merrily hand out £ fines for the smallest misdemeanours, such as dropping fag ends.Yet the private firms trusted with ­dealing with litter louts — and who are disgracefully often employed on contracts which incentivise them to hand out as many fines as  possible — are not  interested in policing housing estates.They are only interested in what they find profitable — dishing out fines to soft targets in shopping centres.Serious antisocial behaviour of the sort which preceded Garry Newlove’s murder falls between two stools — it is considered too much bother for enforcement officers but not serious enough for police investigation.But as Baroness Newlove knows only too well, turning a blind eye to repeated antisocial behaviour makes the lives of residents a misery and can end up ­having fatal consequences.The Government has been quick to respond to proposals from the usual bleeding-heart liberals who seem to run the criminal justice system — recently agreeing, for example, to look into ­abolishing prison sentences of less than six months.Ministers must take note of what the outgoing Victims’ Commissioner is saying on the lax approach to antisocial ­behaviour and put the interests of the victims, not criminals, first. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it was a bad night for Labour too.I think there was a simple message from yesterdays elections to both us and the Labour party - just get on and deliver Brexit.On a visit to Trafford - one of just a handful of Labour gains as the party lost six councils overall - Jeremy Corbyn said: I wanted us to do better, of course.Weve lost some seats across the country, of course I acknowledge that - weve also had swings to Labour in a number of places and also gained seats in several places.Labour failed to make the gains they wanted in key areas - and lost councils such as Darlington, Walsall and Hartlepool.Meanwhile the Lib Dems gained control of ten councils and added more than  seats. And hundreds more independent candidates won than when the same seats were contested four years ago.Neither Nigel Farages Brexit Party nor the pro-EU Change UK was standing in the local elections, and turnout was expected to be very low.But a reported , angry voters spoiled their ballot papers, many in protest at Brexit delays.If the results were mirrored in a general election, the Tories and Labour would be tied on  per cent each with the Lib Dems winning  per cent.Polls closed at pm on Thursday in  council areas of England, as well as the whole of Northern Ireland - and results have been coming in throughout Friday. So far:Tory Chairman Brandon Lewis said this morning it had been a tough night but he urged Labour to stop up and respect the referendum.And Jeremy Hunt admitted the results look like a slap in the face for both the main parties, while Scottish Tories chief Ruth Davidson said: It seems to be a plague on both your houses.Tory MP Vicky Ford said she was gutted to see Chelmsford council go to the Liberal Democrats overnight. Its been brutal, she said.Party veteran Sir David Amess blasted: The results are absolutely dreadful - and called on the PM to quit as soon as possible.Ex-minister Mark Francois warned the Euro elections later this month would be even more disastrous, saying: In a tsunami the sea goes out, and comes crashing back in.This is the sea going out. May  will be an absolute tsunami.But grassroots Tories across the country vented their fury and disappointment with their party after a dficult night for them.Tony Berry, the leader of the Tories on Cotswold District Council, who have lost the council to Liberal Democrats after  years in charge, blasted: I would ask [Theresa May] to consider her position very carefully.He blamed Brexit and professional politicians who are basically working for themselves rather than necessarily what is best for the country.Even top Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg was hit by the backlash - as the Tory councillor for his Somerset neighbourhood was beaten by a Lib Dem.Defeated Tim Warren said last night that people wanted to punish us for a lack of action in Government.There needs to be a change in action, he stressed. The electorate have spoken tonight and they have been very angry.A clearly frustrated Donna Jones, the Conservative group leader on Portsmouth City Council said: I think [Mrs May] needs to take a look at how many councillors we’ve lost overnight, wake up in the morning and think about how she thinks the Conservative party needs to put its best foot forward.And Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin told the BBC: People are very disillusioned, that the country made a decision and the politicians havent implemented.[Theresa May] still has a degree of personal sympathy but people think it’s time for a change.They can see she’s lost the plot, she’s not in control of events.Ex-Cabinet minister Priti Patel said the pitul message she was getting on the doorstep from voters showed her it was time for the PM to go.People have very categorically said she is part of the problem, she said.Our party leadership needs to make some very, very serious decisions. Many of my constituents have said we need a change of leadership. Perhaps the time has come for that.Labour were tipped to pick up seats from the Tories, but so far havent been making any gains.The news will be a blow to the partys hopes of forcing a General Election and taking power in No - as Labour are nowhere near on the right course.Tory sources said at this point under Ed Miliband the party had gained  seats, meaning Mr Corbyn is trailing far behind.But Labour stressed that they were a tough set of elections in mostly areas that leaned towards the Tories - and there were lots of local factors at play too.The partys vow to back a second referendum appeared to have put voters off in the North and Midlands as their share of the vote took a tumble.But it picked up some votes in the South - where some voters are keen on the idea of another vote and remaining in the EU - and secured control of Trafford council.Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said this morning: So far message from local elections - Brexit - sort it. Message received.His words will be seen as a huge hint Labour will be on board to do a deal with the Tories to force Brexit through in the coming weeks.MP Ruth Smeeth said it wasnt good news in her area of Stoke on Trent last night. She said: The leadership needs to look at these results very carefully. This is a strong leave area and my constituents just don’t trust us to deliver.We need clear messaging from the top. Messing around just isnt working. I want to deliver Brexit for my constituents.Furious Sunderland council leader Graeme Miller said the party’s Brexit policy was to blame for losing  seats in his patch.He said: Sunderland voted as a city to leave in June , and having had a Labour message across the city from MPs saying we need to be having a second referendum, people in Sunderland have said ‘we are just not accepting that.One MP told Sky earlier: You stand in the middle of the road and you get run over in both directions. Corbyn must go. He is killing our party and our country.The Lib Dems declared victory today - leader Vince Cable said: “The Liberal Democrats are the big winners of this year’s elections, with already our best result for over  years and more gains expected today.“Voters have sent a clear message that they no longer have confidence in the Conservatives, but they are also refusing to reward Labour while the party preicates on the big issue of the day: Brexit.The results could trigger a fresh challenge to Mrs May as panicked Tories guard against disaster in the EU elections on May  as well as the next General Election.Counting will continue well into Friday in some areas, so the full results wont be known until this afternoon or evening.Chorley -

only to be told there werent any in his area in Hillingdon.BOTH Labour and the Tories have been hit by a huge Brexit backlash as the results from yesterday’s elections continue to flood.Theresa May’s party has lost out badly in the South East and South West - in some of their most traditional seats.The Liberal Democrats have reason to cheer this morning as they turned Chelmsford and the Cotswolds yellow again.And the Tories have lost more than a dozen councils of their own as voters lost patience with them.Some of that will be out of sheer frustration with the Tories, but some of it will be from Remainers determined to use the ongoing Brexit battle to push for a second referendum.Tories are, understandably, irritated with last night’s results, which have them down more than  seats.Grassroots activists and MPs are renewing their calls for Mrs May to go this morning, saying she’s the reason for the bloodbath in the polls.But in reality it’s far better than the numbers which had been predicted - partly this is good expectations management for the Tories.Meanwhile, Labour have suffered from huge drops in their vote in their Northern and Midland heartlands  - with many votes going to independent candidates instead.They’ve lost Hartlepool, Wirral, Bolsolver and Walsall councils overnight, and only managed to gain one - Trafford.They’ve picked up a few chunks of votes in the South - possibly because of their promise to fight for a second referendum - but it’s not outweighed by the amount they’ve lost in the North.MPs said it was proof that their strategy of sitting on the fence to keep everyone happy just wasn’t working, and they needed to show they could be trusted to deliver Brexit. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/as-graphic-election-v15-1845.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"local election results 2019 who won council seats in my area","story":"Thousands of results have come in overnight and the ballots are still being counted across England. Tories and Labour both did poorly but Lib Dems and Greens swept up more seats in the local electionsTories have lost more than two dozen councils and over , seats so far as furious voters slam them for not taking us out of the EU yetLabour are several councils down and have seen a drop of more seats as their position on the fence fails to win them any more support.Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats are up more than  and Independents had a great night as they demand Brexit be stopped altogether.Theresa May has been desperate not to talk about Brexit but fuming voters spoiled their ballots to show their fury at her.The poor results for the Tories could be even worse at the EU elections later this month -

Not even big-hearted Brad has pockets that deep.He is still in the middle of a messy and drawn out orce battle with estranged we Angelina Jolie and he has all that maintenance and child support to take into account.Brad and Jenner were the ultimate golden couple at the height of their power and beauty when they split almost  years ago.It depends on what version of events you believe, but they either called time on their relationship before Brad fell head over heels in lust with Angelina on the set of Mr And Mrs Smith, or she was the other woman who swooped in and bedazzled him.I don’t happen to think you can “steal” someone’s lover or partner, and there must surely have been some flaws in Brad and Jenner’s marriage for him to have taken up with Angelina in the first place.It has to be said, though, that the timeline has always been rather fuzzy.Angelina did once say in an interview that Mr And Mrs Smith was a chance for their children to watch Mum and Dad falling in love, and that they had all sat down in front of the TV as a family to watch the film on DVD.This prompted Jenner to hit back, albeit in a classy and dignied fashion, saying she had no idea anything was going on at that time, and Angelina’s remarks were “uncool” and “inappropriate”.Jenner has never really vented any feelings of hurt and anger in public, and always behaved like a lady. I do wonderBrad ever laments the loss of the uncomplicated woman he once loved so very much.For a time, Brad and Angelina appeared to be extremely happy with their brood of children and stellar film careers, but no one knows what really goes on behind closed doors and it all started to unravel for them almost three years ago.There were accusations and recriminations on both sides in a bloody war of attrition that really should have reached a truce by this stage.Interestingly, both Brad and Jenner are now single, though he was linked to Charlize Theron in January.Her short-lived marriage to American actor Justin Theroux went belly-up last year.The rumour mill went into hyperdrive when Brad turned up at Jenner’s th bash in February and the two were seen to be getting on well.There would be something very satisfying about this ridiculously good-looking, hugely successful famous ex-couple getting back together, but I’m not sureyou can ever reheat the souffle.Perhaps you can eventually become friends, but whether or not you can forgive heartaches, betrayals and past pain is debatable.Sadly, I don’t think we will be celebrating Brad and Jen the sequel any time soon.THIS time last year my lovely friend and colleague Helen Addis was diagnosed with breast cancer, and the world went from colour to black and white.She is only , has three young kids and her cancer was particularly ugly and aggressive.Twelve months down the line, after gruelling treatment, Helen has somehow transformed her devastating diagnosis into a real positive.Thanks to her courage and tenacity, and her cracking good idea, she will actually be saving lives.Helen’s simple but effective plan is to have a sticker on the mirror of changing rooms in shops and gyms showing what changes to look out for in your breasts, as well as details of my colleague Dr Hilary Jones’s guide to checking online.So when you are checking yourself out in a new outfit, you can also remember to check your boobs.For more information see itv lorraineTHE birth of any new baby is a cause of joy and celebration.For the parents, it’s emotional, uplting, overwhelming and also a tiny bit scary.Harry and Meghan will be no dferent to any other mum and dad because, unlike domestic appliances, babies don’t come with instruction manuals.The royal couple will be nervous about the first bath and will anxiously listen out for their little one breathing during the night.Despite all the expert advice they can count on, they will still be typical, nervous, first-time parents.While I totally respect their right to a certain degree of privacy during the later stages of pregnancy and the birth, I do think it was a mistake to fly so low under the radar at this time.The most dangerous development for any member of the Royal Family isn’t rampant republicanism. Instead, the big threat is indference.If people don’t care any more about the royals then the whole fragile monarchy could crumble like a stale meringue.Obviously, just like all new mums and dads Harry and Meghan will want and need time to adjust to being a family.It would, however, be a shame , as has been forecast, they decide to completely withdraw from public le for the foreseeable future apart from some very cute Instagram posts.There’s a danger people will shrug their shoulders and find other online influencers, or fail to turn up in all weathers to line the streets and give hearty cheers when Harry and Meghan eventually do resurface.Apart from the Queen, no member of the Royal Family can take the adulation, support or even tolerance of the British public for granted.Harry and Meghan have the potential to be a tremendous asset to the royals and there’s huge affection for both of them, especially now.They can build on this and make a better future for all the world’s children, as well as their little one.MADONNA kicked ass at the Billboard Awards in Vegas earlier this week.She showed all the young pretenders that there really is only one true Queen Of Pop – and she’s a -year-old woman with chipmunk cheeks and the tight, muscular body of a -year-old pole dancer.I love her new ­single, Medellin, and I adored that ­Billboard performance complete with state-of-the-art Madonna holograms.It made everyone  look a little bit ordinary.There have been many imitators over the years, but there is only one Madonna. No one  even comes close.TONY SLATTERY was once a constant presence on our screens.He seemed to be on every single TV  show and had the same sort of manic comic genius displayed by the late, great Robin Williams.Tony largely disappeared from public le in the late Nineties and endured a long struggle with mental health issues as well as booze and drug addiction. At one point he admits he was spending four grand a week on cocaine and vodka.I often wondered what had happened to Tony, and it was heartening to see him popping up on This Morning this week, talking openly about being bipolar and living with depression.He’s older, greyer and wiser, and very lucky to have the support of his partner of  years, actor Mark Michael Hutchinson.It’s just a real shame that at a time when Tony really needed help, talking about mental health was still taboo and could end your career. Thank the Lord things are slowly changing for the better.I wish Tony all the best as he rebuilds his career and looks forward to performing again at the Edinburgh Festival this summer. The world needs his funny, witty and honest take on le.SACKED Defence Secretary Gavin ­Williamson has sworn on his ­children’s lives that he didn’t leak ­Cabinet secrets.That’s a bold and vehement statement that no loving dad would ever make lightly.Whatever the truth, it’s another example of the utter shambles at the heart of Westminster, and how worrying that no one is the least bit surprised or shocked by these allegations.TODAY is an important one for Star Wars fans, who celebrate the date as “May The th Be With You”.See what they did there I’m actually more concerned about the magnicent sci-fi TV series The Orville, with no word yet on whether the genius creation of Seth ­MacFarlane has been renewed for a third series.I’d love fellow geeks to put me out of my misery and confirm whether we can look forward to more episodes of a show that captures the true essence of my beloved Star Trek in a far more affectionate and authentic way than its rival Star Trek: Discovery.It would be a travestywe weren’t able to boldly go on new adventures with the funny, exasperating, lovable and entertaining crew of The Orville.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Even after twelve years of hoping and praying we trust that God has not abandoned us or Madeleine.We come together again to show our support for Kate and Gerry, for other parents of missing children and young people, to help keep alive the tune of hope which persists through all the storms and sorrows.”Kate chose not to say any words publicly - Gerry normally addresses the anniversary well wishers - but she later thanked the near -strong crowd inidually for their continued support.Brian - the brother of Kate’s mum Susan Healy who was at a prayer service in her home city of Liverpool - said: “We are all very grateful to those who turned out this evening in less than pleasant conditions.

Keep away everyone.”A follower added: “I saw this out side my other halfs bar, he was chopping the fruit up on the bin lid, and lting bottles of spirits up out of the drains.”Cops in holiday resorts across Spain began targeting the sellers last year after finding that the sellers store their ingredients in filthy drains.They have released a shocking video of officers in Barcelona lting manhole covers to reveal bottles, towels, straws, ice and glasses stored underground in putrid conditions.Three men were charged in for selling the potentially lethal bacteria-laden drinks.Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported that scientists found that some of the drinks contained E-coli bacteria and traces of human faeces which could cause serious illness and even death.They are half the price of drinks sold at beach-front bars but tourists risk falling ill by drinking the cocktails.Cops in Benidorm also mounted extra patrols in the Brits’ favourite resort to end the lucrative illegal trade.Sellers have also been seen washing the fruit under showers designed to remove sand from the feet of beach-goers.Travel writer Lauren Bate – who lives on the Costa Blanca – has warned holidaymakers about the stomach-churning trade on her blog Diary of a Spanglish Girl.“Nothing says summer like sipping a cocktail in the sun, kicking back. Relaxation mode on, she said.“Do it wrong, you could end up spending the rest of your holiday with your head down the toilet, or hospitalised.

This is especially the case when the Government is barely ing, bitterly ided and responsible for nine years of punitive local government cuts. There are still several dozen councils to declare but as I write the  Tories have lost  seats and  councils, Labour is down  councillors and has lost control of three councils , while the Lib Dems have gained  seats and eight councils and the Greens are up  seats. Jeremy Corbyn had hoped that voters would park Brexit and be receptive to Labour’s promises to rebuild areas worst hit by Tory austerity.  Instead voters looked at the two major parties and  decided to cast a pox on both their houses. The Conservatives have been punished for their glaring failure to deliver Brexit and general incompetence. For Labour they have discovered the hard way that voters also resent equivocation. As Nye Bevan once said: “We know what happens to people who stay in the middle of the road. They get run down.” These elections should sound the death knell for Corbyn’s policy of constructive ambiguity which has seen Labour try to appeal to both leave and remain voters. By sitting on the fence, Labour has been punished by remain voters in the south who have gone to the Lib Dems and the Greens and by leave voters in its traditional heartlands of Bolsover and Sunderland.  Questions will also be raised about whether Mr Corbyn’s leadership may also have repelled previously loyal Labour voters.Labour activists says the Labour leaderaposs suitability for office came up repeatedly on the doorstep. The Tories did win something last night: the expectations game.

Theresa May is facing another uprising in her party after a string of defeats in her Home Counties heartlands as local councillors are punished for chaos over Brexit. Losses include an astonishing wipeout of the Toriesapos -seat majority in Chelmsford, handing power to anti-Brexit Lib Dems and leaving an MP in tears. But Labour also lost seats and lost its grip on key councils as MPs warned Jeremy Corbyn had failed to give a clear Brexit message to the nation. It was a plague on both your houses as Labour took back symbolic jewel Trafford and gained Amber Valley and Calderdale - but lost control of northern heartlands Hartlepool, Wirral and Bolsover.    With all but a few seats declared, an analysis of the national votes by the BBC suggested that the vote share between the two parties was tied on % a piece - suggesting the deadlocked parliament might represent what the country really thinks about British politics. Meanwhile Brexiteers vented their fury at the main parties by spoiling masses of ballot papers and, in some cases, staying at home. Jeremy Corbyn said he was very sorry for the losses and accepted Brexit was a factor. Yet Theresa May did not say the S-word even after a Tory heckler shouted resign! at the Prime Minister. Meanwhile the Lib Dems claimed their best night ever, taking councils including Bath and North East Somerset in Jacob Rees-Moggaposs back yard.    And it was a good night for protest votes for Independents, as well as the Greens who experts said were enjoying their best local elections night so far. There was a mixed picture overnight in the  local elections - where , seats in mainly Tory areas were up for grabs. The Tories had the most to lose, and lose they did, with Home Counties councils Basildon, Southend-on-Sea, Folkestone  Hythe, St Albans and Welwyn Hatfield slipping away. They also lost control of Broxtowe - home to the Remainer MP Anna Soubry - amid Labour gains. But spinning Tories tried to downplay the disaster. Brexit Minister James Cleverly said: If it was  rather than , I would be happy with that.  Jeremy Corbynaposs party had some big symbolic wins, finally seizing the once-blue Manchester island of Trafford back into red control. There were some southern gains too, such as six seats in Folkestone and Hythe. And Labour gained one seat in Peterborough - which is staging a crucial by-election on June  - as the Tories lost it to No Overall Control. Plymouth, Southampton and Reading also consolidated previous advances. But Labour also lost control of northern Bolsover, home to legendary Brexiteer Labour MP Dennis Skinner.  The party failed to gain control of Midlands Brexit stomping ground Stoke-on-Trent. Hartlepool was lost from Labour control as was Wirral - where the Labour share of the vote was down %, according to the BBC. And an eye-watering nine seats were lost in northern Labour heartland - and Leave-voting area - Sunderland.

It was the worst performance by a governing party in almost  years and it has been dubbed a massacre as the bruised Conservative Party takes stock in the aftermath. With Mrs May facing fresh calls to step down amid stalled Brexit talks, former leader Iain Duncan Smith said she was now a caretaker Prime Minister. He said she should set an immediate date for her departure or a committee of senior Conservative members of parliament should do it for her.    The PM will reportedly be challenged on Tuesday to set a timetable for her departure. Sir Graham Brady, head of the  Committee of Tory backbenchers, will meet with the Prime Minister when the Commons s on Tuesday to request that she set a date for her own exit, the Times reported.The report said Sir Graham met with Mrs May on Thursday and agreed to defer the committeeaposs demand for her to set a date until after the elections. A source on the committee told the Times thatMrs May refuses to set a date it could move to rewrite the rules to force a no-confidence vote in her leadership. Sir David Amess, the MP for Southend West, has called on the committee to take action, saying: I think it would have been much more sensible , before the election, trough the  Committee there had been some precise date put on when Theresa would be departing, and then the election process can go ahead.    Mr Duncan Smith told LBC that Mrs May was now a caretaker Prime Minister and she should announce her departure date immediately. Anger at the mounting scale of losses saw Mrs May heckled as she gave a speech in Wales, with a man shouting: Why donapost you resign  We donapost want you. Mrs May has said she will stand down as Tory leader when an EU withdrawal agreement is ratied, handing over to a successor to negotiate the future relationship with the EU. But she has not yet given in to pressure to name a date for her departure.The Prime Minister appeared to put the future of her party in the hands of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, by welcoming his offer to help her resolve the Brexit deadlock.As counts terminated, Mrs May could only claim the election was always going to be dficult at a speech in Grimsby, one of the few areas in which the Conservatives enjoyed success.    She said: Because we havenapost delivered the Brexit deal through Parliament yet, this was going to be a particularly challenging set of elections for both of the main parties. As the party who has been in government for nine years, it was of course always going to be particularly dficult for us. But as we look at what happened, nobody was expecting that Labour was going to do as badly as they did. Labour lost  seats when the party had expected to make gains, losing out to a surge in support for Lib Dems and Greens campaigning on an explicitly anti-Brexit ticket, as well as independent candidates. Mr Corbyn left no doubt he saw the results as a demand for resolution of the Brexit impasse three years after the  vote for EU withdrawal.    He told ITV: I think it means thereaposs a huge impetus on every MP, and theyaposve all got that message, whether they themselves are leave or remain - or the people across the country - that an arrangement has to be made, a deal has to be done, parliament has to resolve this issue. I think that is very, very clear. And shadow chancellor John McDonnell tweeted: So far, message from local elections - aposBrexit - sort itapos. Message received. Mrs May welcomed the Labour leaderaposs offer to get a Brexit deal done as the only escape route.She said: I welcome the fact that Jeremy Corbyn has said today that he sees the time is now to get a deal and to deliver on Brexit - itaposs what Iaposve been saying for some time.Itaposs what we want to do, itaposs what weaposve been working for, so now we must get on and do that. But backbench MPs called for her removal and warned that the party would be toastit did not change direction.  Heckler Stuart Davies, a Tory Party member and former county councillor, said he called for Mrs May to resign because of her handling of Brexit. The -year-old, from Llangollen, said: I am furious at what she has done to our party. To put it bluntly, she is telling lies - aposWe will be out by March apos. I think I share the views of a lot of people who are party members. I did what I did because I know it was the right thing to do. There were calls from Tory MPs for Mrs Mayaposs removal as leader, with senior Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin warning that the party would be toast unless it mends its ways pretty quickly. He said voters overwhelmingly believed that the Prime Minister had lost the plot and that the time had come for a change of leader. Certainly among Conservative activists and council candidates there is an almost universal feeling that it is time for her to move on, he said. His comments were echoed by former Cabinet minister Priti Patel, who said voters saw Mrs May as part of the problem. I just donapost think we can continue like this. We need change, we need a change of leadership. Perhaps the time has now come for that, she told the BBC.  Former Brexit secretary David Davis has said he will not run to replace Theresa May as Prime Minister, declaring his support for Dominic Raab in the upcoming contest for Conservative leader. The -year-old Brexiteer - who came second to David Cameron in the  leadership contest, but did not put himself forward in  - said the Tories need a generational change in leadership. He said that Mr Raab, , was the best-placed Brexit candidate to win the necessary support among MPs and party members and, above all, broaden our appeal to voters.Writing in the Daily Mail, he warned that upcoming European elections on May  risk being far worse than the local elections.Labour was also licking its wounds after forfeiting control in heartland councils like Burnley, Hartlepool and Bolsover. Despite some predictions that Jeremy Corbynaposs party could pick up three-figure gains, Labour was down more than  seats, though it did have the consolation of restoring control in Trafford for the first time sine . Remain-backing Labour MPs warned the leadership against striking a Brexit deal without the promise of a referendum, after shadow cabinet minister Barry Gardiner suggested the party was bailing out Tories in cross-party talks.  Ilford North MP Wes Streeting said: Labour should not be bailing the Tories out. Any deal - any - must go to a public vote. Without a commitment to a public vote, Iaposll vote for a Labour-Tory deal when hell freezes over and Iaposm not alone in that. With all results in the Conservatives had lost , seats, Labour  and Ukip . The Lib Dems gained , the Greens were up  and independents increased by .The Conservatives lost councils including Peterborough, Warwick and Worcester to no overall control, while Bath and North East Somerset, Somerset West and Taunton fell to the Liberal Democrats, with North Kesteven going to independents.However the party held on in the bellwether council of Swindon, seen as a possible Labour gain, and took Walsall and North East Lincolnshire from no overall control. Labour, meanwhile, lost control in Darlington, Middlesbrough, Stockton and Wirral and the mayoralty in Middlesbrough, where its vote was down  per cent as independent Andy Preston was elected, although it did gain control of Amber Valley from Tories. Even where the party held on in its traditional stronghold of Sunderland, which voted heavily for Brexit in the  referendum, it still lost  council seats.

Voters turned their back on the big two parties in favour of the Greens, Lib Dems and independent candidates. While this was a disappointing night for Labour we should not lose sight of the fact the biggest losers were the Tories who suffered the worst council results of any party since . Voters delivered a damning verdict on a Government which has run out of steam, lacks compassion and has failed in its overriding task of delivering Brexit. Labour’s failure to make headway should prompt some soul searching in Jeremy Corbyn’s team.    The party should be especially concerned it lost ground in its former bastions of Bolsover, Hartlepool, Burnley and Middlesbrough. Winning control of Trafford and the Amber Valley are a consolation but these gains cannot disguise the fact that Labour needs to do more to appeal to voters outside the big cities. While there is a way forward for Labour, the same cannot be said of Theresa May’s Conservatives. This is a threadbare administration which has no plan for Brexit and has abandoned any pretence it is governing in the national interest. The Tory hammering was entirely deserved.

Darryl Nicholson, , has stage three emphysema - a form of chronic obstructive pulmonary - that causes the destruction of the lungs and means he struggles with daily tasks such as shortness of breath, wheezing and fatigue.The dad from Newcastle, who also has bronchitis asthma, anxiety and depression, told the Chronicle he was able to live with the condition before becoming too ill to work.He was receiving Employment Support Allowancebut after attending a mandatory work capability assessment the Department for Work and Pensionsdeemed him fit for working.    He said: I failed even though my condition has worsened. But because I can hold a pen, open a door and use technology, they think I am fit for work. Doing simple tasks, such as getting dressed, can leave me breathless. I live in a bungalow and the bus stop outside is  to  metres away that I canapost walk to so I get taxis, which I now struggle to afford. I have to plan my routes to seethere are walls and benches to rest on. Darryl, who tragically lost his we to cancer, underwent a mandatory reconsideration which was rejected and he is now awaiting a tribunal. I should be focusing on le instead of this, he said. I have spoken to people about work, but I donapost know what I could do to be honest. I am stage three and would have more sick days than working days. While on ESA, Darryl received £ per month directly into his bank account.But after being put on to  Universal Credit  his money has been halved, receiving just £ per month.After paying £ for his phone bill, £ per month for electric and £. for gas, Darryl is left with around £ per week for food.  Darryl, who worked in the catering industry, said: I applied for Universal Credit and got my first payment which was £ which means I canapost take medication because I canapost afford to eat. Iaposm not expecting to go on holiday or buy a car. Iaposm just expecting to be able to live. Sometimes I only have one meal a day, and there are days where I go with no food. This has a knock on affect and means that I canapost take all of my medications because you have to take food with them. Iaposve lost half a stone. A downside of my illness is that my immune system is weak and it will only weaken. Iaposve applied for two more benefits, one the illness and disability enhancements on Universal Credit and Personal Independent Payment. Darryl said going through the process was humiliating.  He said: I know I am going to die young. I was young when I got diagnosed, now Iaposm , and have been told I could live until Iaposm . Someone who does not understand this condition made this decision, with someone with even less understanding making a final decision. Darryl, whose we died when she was just , underwent a mandatory reconsideration which was rejected and he is now awaiting a tribunal. I should be focusing on le instead of this, he said. I have spoken to people about work, but I donapost know what I could do to be honest. I am stage three and would have more sick days than working days. Darryl said the mandatory reconsideration process needs overhauling and the tribunal service needs to clear its back log, starting fresh. He added: If they were doing their job properly there wouldnapost be as many cases at tribunal stage. They have been told by my doctor that I have this really, really serious illness, and they have basically said aposNo, you do notapos. It is ridiculous. Darryl said: Iaposm wanting to share this not just for me, but for the thousands of other people who are also affected. It is atrocious and is like going back to the Second World War. It is like a slow genocide. A DWP spokesman said: “Decisions for ESA are made by medical professionals following consideration of all the information provided by the claimant, including evidence from their GP or medical specialist. “There is a free and independent appeals process where claimants can provide any further documentation.

Kate attended a prayer service alongside family and friends in the familyaposs home village as Portuguese police reveal they could be closing in on a suspected kidnapper. Brave Kate, , and her twins Sean and Amelie were warmly welcomed by the community during the poignant service in Rothley, Leicestershire, on Friday evening. Maddieaposs father, heart doctor Gerry, was unable to attend because he was busy working in Italy  years to the day that the three-year-old girl - who would turn  this month - vanished on a family holiday in Praia da Luz.    Former GP Kate was “overwhelmed” by the support as she joined in prayers and readings to mark the occasion - the first anniversary without husband Gerry by her side. Her uncle Brian Kennedy said before the half hour service that the family “still had hope even after all these years. The retired head teacher, , declined to discuss detectivesapos potential new leads which they have yet to be informed about, saying: “We’re just grateful that police are still searching. It gives us hope. Kate, wearing a purple puffa jacket and black jeans and with her hair freshly highlighted and trimmed, fought back tears during as children, including her -year-old twins Sean and Amelie, lit candles for Maddie and other lost youngsters.    A note left next to one candle read: Madeleine,  years on we are still hoping and praying for that special day xx. The gathering had been due to take place at the war memorial in Rothley, where a candle burns around the clock as a beacon of hope for the world’s most famous missing child. But it was moved into the nearby local Baptist Church to avoid possible rain. Vicar the Rev Rob Gladstone, who led the prayers, opened the service by saying: “A warm and a very dry welcome.   Even after  years of hoping and praying we trust that God has not abandoned us or Madeleine.We come together again to show our support for Kate and Gerry, for other parents of missing children and young people, to help keep alive the tune of hope which persists through all the storms and sorrows.” Kate chose not to say any words - Gerry normally addresses the anniversary well wishers - but she later thanked the near -strong crowd inidually for their continued support. Brian - the brother of Kate’s mum Susan Healy, who was at a prayer service in her home city of Liverpool, said: “We are all very grateful to those who turned out this evening in less than pleasant conditions.  It means a lot to us that people are still willing to support us.” He told how eminent cardiologist Gerry would be remembering his daughter during his hectic business trip to Milan. During the service touching messages of support were read out by school friends of Maddie’s younger twin siblings. They joined locals placing name tags of missing people on a vine tree of hope, including Claudia Lawrence and Ben Needham.  A schoolboy paid tribute to British and Portuguese police hunting for Maddie’s abductor, saying: “We pray for the team of women and men who still searching for Madeleine. Guide them as they work hard to find the truth. Three-year-old Maddie vanished from a holiday apartment in Portugal’s Praia da Luz in May . She was discovered missing from her bed in a seaside complex apartment by her horried mum shortly after pm. She had been left alone with her younger twin siblings while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with their seven pals.  Portuguese officers, believed to be acting on a tip off from Scotland Yard, say a sex fiend who speaks English and wears a surgical mask could have snatched Maddie from her room. Kate and Gerry cling onto a glimmer of hope that Maddie - who would turn  on May  - could still be alive. In a new posting on the official Find Maddie campaign website they vowed to carry on looking for their daughter “for as long as it takes”. They told of their “comfort and reassurance” that the police hunt to find her continues. In message to mark the latest harrowing milestone which they wish they could “fast forward” they share their heartache that Maddie would soon be celebrating her sixteenth birthday.  They wrote: It’s that time of year again. As much as we’d like to fast forward the first couple of weeks of May, there’s no getting around it.” Meanwhile, Scotland Yard has asked for more funding as it continues to follow up leads in Maddieaposs disappearance. British police launched their own investigation, Operation Grange, in  after a Portuguese inquiry failed to make progress. Force bosses have been applying for funding from the Home Office every six months to continue the inquiry, which has cost about £.million. Last November, a further £, was granted. On Thursday, Commissioner Cressida Dick confirmed the politan Police had applied for more Home Office funding. She said: We have active lines of inquiries and I think the public would expect us to see those through. A very small team continues to work on this case with Portuguese colleagues and we have put in an application to the Home Office for further funding.

The mum-of-two and her husband are now living off the bare bones so they can scrape together the £ monthly rent.But she told Birmingham Live it is near impossible on a mere £-a-month Universal Credit payment.  Gillian - who suffers with angina, arthritis and diabetes - said: Weaposre left with £ for the month.Weaposve got other things to pay out, we have to pay electric, gas, weaposre not left with a lot to live on. Weaposre living on about £ a week for me and my husband. Itaposs not really covering food, weaposre struggling. Weaposre eating whatever we can. Weaposve been living on egg and chips for the last week and thataposs not good for my diabeties.    The disgruntled couple, who live with their -year-old son, are also paying bedroom tax since their daughter, , left home. Mrs Leader added: Weaposve lived there since , but when my daughter left home we were paying bedroom tax straight away, but we were on income support - so it wasnapost too bad.  But now weaposve gone over to the Universal Credit in February, itaposs dramatically lowered the amount of money coming in. Now having to pay our own rent, they donapost do income support anymore.  We were struggling before but itaposs got even worse now weaposre on Universal Credit. The family have been back and forth to Birmingham City Council with their desperate pleas to move to a smaller bungalow suitable for Gillianaposs mobility issues.    The move would mean Gillian would not have to pay for bedroom tax, the high-rent or maintenance on her in-house lt. And as they have Band  priority, they were offered a suitable, two-bed bungalow in Percy Road Sparkbrook. But it was taken away from them by a family who needed it more. A spokesperson for DWP, who manage Universal Credit, said: They are on less than they were on income support because the components are dferent with Universal Credit. They are on less because they inherited a large amount and when that was whittled down, they claimed for Universal Credit. They also have a number of other incomes such as disability allowance and carers allowance. If they do move to a smaller property that would help them. n response to the claims, Birmingham City Council said in extreme cases, a property can be withdrawn. They added that as of last year, they now allow disabled tenants to bid on regular properties with the option of adaptations being implemented. A statement from Birmingham City Council read: “With over , people on our housing waiting list and a national housing shortage currently in place, we advise that people bid proactively as we have a limited stock. However, we also recognise that allowing more flexibility would provide a greater number of people with the support they need. This is why a new process was introduced last year that allows anyone who requires an adapted property to bid for general properties that will then be adapted to meet their agreed needs. “If an emergency situation transpires, it can sometimes be necessary to withdraw the property from the bidding cycle. This is only done in extreme circumstances when all other options have been explored.” "},{"url":null,"title":"parents runaway bride 16 told","story":"NewsParents of runaway bride, , told to pay CHILD SUPPORT to her husband, Claire Milliner and Martin Chambers, whose teen daughter eloped to Gretna Green to marry an older man, were asked to pay £, in child maintenanceShareCommentsByChris kitching:,  MAY NewsMum Claire Milliner says she was shocked when the letters arrived \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The parents of a -year-old girl who ran off to Gretna Green to marry an older man say they were stunned when they received letters demanding they pay child maintenance for her.Claire Milliner, , and Martin Chambers, , said their teenage daughter eloped to the village in Scotland to marry Thomas Arnold, , last December.

It killed a husband and his pregnant we, both in their s, last week. The travellers are understood to be from US, Netherlands, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, and South Korea. The dramatic new photos show them wearing face masks in western Mongolia. The quarantine regime is a desperate attempt to prevent the spread of the bubonic plague.

Other images from capital Ulaanbaatar have shown at least one aircraft being met by anti-contamination emergency workers in a bid to prevent spread of the disease.    The tragic Mongolian couple who reportedly died from the plague got infected after eating the raw kidneys of a marmot, it is understood.

Russian tourists told of the lockdown preventing the international travellers from leaving.    The city is closed due to some plague-contaminated marmots, wrote traveler Elena Kovena from Kemerovo in Siberia. This is just so surreal. She said: Did you think that the plague was something from the Dark Ages  Us too.

Tightly guarded, the inhabitants rabidly loyal, the sprawling campus of the controversial Chinese telecoms firm is so isolated that the only way in is by the company’s own tolled motorway. Around , work in the one-mile-square complex, many also living there and rarely leave the remote facility. Until this week, the name Huawei was mostly seen only in phone shops. But now it’s at the centre of a huge political storm over allegations sacked Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson leaked secret discussions about allowing it to take a leading role in UK telecoms. Critics say that while this would not be quite like letting the Communist Chinese into our front rooms, it would certainly allow them to eavesdrop on everything going on. Of course, Huawei’s -year-old founder Ren Zhengfei denies all this strenuously – and does it without stroking a Blofeld-style white cat.    This is probably the time to mention that not only is Zhengfei a former Red Army soldier, one of Huawei’s earliest contracts was to provide telecoms for the People’s Liberation Army. Zhou Daiqi, the company’s chief ethics and compliance officer, is also head of the Huawei branch of the Chinese Communist Party. And China is a country where, by law, a company cannot refuse to help the party spy on other nations.The UK political storm blew up after it emerged Huawei has reportedly won permission to help build our new G network – with PM Theresa May giving the go ahead despite warnings from her Home, Defence and Foreign Secretaries, and the UK’s closest allies.   But one British researcher who visited Huawei’ HQ in Shenzhen is “deeply troubled” at the prospect of the firm helping build our cyber network. He said: “I wasn’t allowed anywhere on my own and had a minder the whole time. “They were very cagey about me taking photos of certain places. It was similar to Chinese government buildings I’ve visited. Every desk had a party flag and Chinese flag. “Clearly, the party comes first. So in any situation needing a decision it will always be in the best interests of the party, not those of the clients. “I saw some tall African guys in traditional dress and asked who they were. “I was told they were from Sudan, Mali and Ethiopia buying new phone systems. At that time Sudan was under sanctions, its people under a very oppressive regime, yet Huawei were treating their leaders like VIPs.” The researcher said it was shocking the UK had decided to award the G contract.  He added: “I can’t believe what Theresa May is doing. From what I saw, signing a deal with China is basically signing the UK’s secrets away.” UK links with Huawei go back to  when BT signed a supply con­­tract. When the researcher visited the Chinese HQ, the BT logo was plain to see. But even BT confirmed last year it is removing Huawei equipment from key areas following concerns. Huawei – the name translates as “China is able” – has grown from nothing  years ago to an annual revenue of about £billion last year. That was when it became the second biggest seller of smartphones – flogging million worldwide, behind Samsung but ahead of Apple. It is already contracted to build  G networks around the world and owner Zhengfei is said to be the world’s rd richest man worth over £billion.  This unbelievable growth has caused many to speculate on whether Huawei is a front for the China’s plans to expand its world influence. With the country now the leading source of cyber attacks, analysts have warned Beijing may be using Huawei to spy on competitors and steal intellectual property. It could even, once in control of its systems, shut down a foreign power’s infrastructure. Last week the US warned involving Huawei in our G network risked giving China a “loaded gun”. When he meets Theresa May next Wednesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will again warn of the threat. He recently warned the US would not be able to share intelligence with a country using Huawei systems.  In fact, three of the so-called “Five Eyes” intelligence-sharing community – America, Australia and New Zealand – have banned Huawei from their G networks. Canada is reviewing its relationship. Each cites evidence the company may use its technology to sabotage or spy on their citizens and governments, including the discovery of “hidden backdoors” which could enable China to spy on people in their homes and workplaces. A senior security source said “It is highly worrying that the deal with Huawei could erode the Five Eyes alliance. “Despite assurances from the PM, it is asking an awful lot for people to separate the Chinese State and its intelligence agencies from a high profile com­­mun­­ications company with close links to both.” Last week it was reported Vodafone had found “hidden back doors” in Huawei equipment that “could have given unauthorised access to the fixed-line network in Italy”.  In January US prosecutors charged Huawei with stealing tech­­nology after an employee sneaked into a T-Mobile testing lab, put a robotic arm in his bag, and walked out. Last December founder Zhengfei’s daugh­­ter, the company’s finance chief, was arrested in Canada on suspicion of breaking US sanctions on Iran. She is now awaiting extradited to the US. In what was seen as an act of retaliation, China sentenced two Canadians to death on drugs charges. It is perhaps no wonder, then, that our security services have long warned the government of the huge risks of allowing Huawei to have anything to do with communications systems. Warnings which Theresa May has clearly failed to heed.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

However, Mr Cameron had failed to noty Scottish Borders Council planners about the change of use, who found out once concerned neighbours began to complain about noise disturbances by rowdy hen parties.In November , Mr Cameron received an enforcement notice from the council outlining its grievances, which included concerns over noise disturbances, a detrimental impact on residential amenity and a breach of planning protocol.Mr Cameron subsequently appealed to the Scottish Governmentrsquos department for planning and environmental appeals , saying that because the property has been used for this purpose for more than ten years the council could no longer object to the change of use.The appeal statement also outlines the steps Mr Cameron has made in order to mitigate the noise disturbances from his property.This includes removing two hot tubs from the rear of the building, and instead installing a new one in the spa, which has triple-glazing to minimise noise impact.Mr Cameron has also proposed to remove the barbeque facility from the rear decking of the property, in an effort to stop groups of guests congregating outside.Finally, Mr Cameron has proposed employing a night manager to monitor the property and sound levels between pm and am on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, and to give the four closest neighbours a direct line to the night manager to raise any issues immediately.Despite this, the DPEA has ruled against the West Linton businessman, and has been two months to cease using the property as a party mansion.Chirs Norman, a DPEA reporter appointed by Scottish Ministers, writes in his ruling: ldquoBefore  November  the availability of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo for holiday letting, and its limited use for  weeks, was ordinarily incidental to its main use as a house.ldquoSome two or three years after  November  it ceased to be the appellantrsquos main residence.ldquoFrom  lsquoGreenloaningrsquo was continually promoted and used as self-catering accommodation for short-stay lets.ldquoOn the balance of probability and on the basis of the evidence before me I find that the unauthorised change of use of the house occurred between  November  and  November .ldquoTherefore the council is not time-barred from taking enforcement action and the appellantrsquos appeal fails.ldquoI find that the house is accessed from an unsurfaced road in the north-east part of West Linton and is in an area characterised by large, in the main, detached houses set in substantial garden grounds in a semi-rural part of the village.ldquoIts location some  metres from the A  and the centre of the village means that residents in the area enjoy a very high standard of amenity.ldquoI have studied the representations on the case and note the alleged impact on residential amenity caused by the use of the property for short-stay letting.ldquoI further note that the appellant has taken steps to curtail the effects of the unauthorised use, and in particular noise and alleged anti-social behaviour.ldquoI am also mindful of the support given by persons staying at lsquoGreenloaningrsquo to businesses in the village.ldquoHowever, I conclude that the unauthorised use of lsquoGreenloaningrsquo has an unacceptable impact on the character of the established amenity in this generally quiet part of West Linton.ldquoExternal activity can arise after . hours and a signicant change into the quiet residential area has been introduced.ldquoThe two-month time period for the cessation of the use is reasonable, given the impact of the unauthorised development on the amenity of this part of West Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"explorers-great-mystery-comes-to-borders-stages","story":"A LIGHT-HEARTED romp featuring starvation, scurvy, cannibalism and some jolly tunes comes to the Borders next week.The new play by Peter Arnott for Mull Theatre, Unspotted Snow, is based on the tale of Sir John Franklinrsquos ill-fated expedition to discover the Northwest Passage.In , Franklin and  men sailed off to discover a route from the Atlantic to the Pacic via the north coast of Canada, but were never seen again.A bold and adventurous account of tragedy, mishap, folly, arrogance and madness, it also serves as a cautionary tale of true-blue British heroism ndash and some ruthless news management.After nine years, news of the expedition was at last brought to London by the remarkable Orcadian explorer and physician John Rae, who worked for the Hudsonrsquos Bay Company.The news he brought was both tragic and grizzly. Unfortunately for Rae, it was the wrong story ndash true, but wrong in that it was not the story that Victorian England wanted.Unspotted Snow is a play of two halves: the first set on the barren ice flows of the Arctic and the second in the equally inhospitable environment of Lady Jane Franklinrsquos drawing room.As playwright Arnott explained, unlike Franklin and the majority of th century British explorers, Rae was uninterested in conquest and the imposition of religious, commercial, or imperial norms on the wilderness.ldquoLike John Muir in Calornia, he anticipated a much more lsquomodernrsquo holistic approach to the natural world, not seeing people as being conquerors of empty space but as inhabitants of a planet shared with other forms of le, he said.The story of the expedition has fascinated the general public, scientists and explorers for over  years.From early findings of frozen corpses and a few artefacts to the very recent discoveries of the expeditionrsquos boats, the Erebusand the Terror , successive generations have been enthralled by the ambition and daring-do of the explorers and by their terrying, macabre fate.That fascination, and the split between two realities, is emphasised by the two-part nature of the play.ldquoIn the first half, a kind of horror-comedy, we have an encounter between three of the last survivors of Franklinrsquos expedition and some Inuit ladies to whom they utterly fail to explain themselves, explained Arnott.ldquoAnd then, in a curious echo of that, we have the inhospitable wilderness of Lady Franklinrsquos Drawing Room, where John Rae again finds himself telling a story that his audience simply cannot, or will not, understand.Unspotted Snow will be performed at the MacArts in Galashiels on Thursday, May  and

the other side of the world in some of the poorest countries on earth.ldquoI spent most of my time living in slums, which ied from corrugated houses to mud houses with grass thatched roofs.During his time in Africa, Dominic acted as a trustee for Roll Out the Barrel Trust UK, a project that aims to help with water supply issues in some of the worldrsquos poorest countries.Dominic also helped found a charity in Kenya, The Sunflower Community Orphans Support Project.The organization helps feed orphaned children, many of whom are affected by poverty and HIV AIDS, by using the proceeds of a

have electricity and water shortages and to fetch and carry drinking water.ldquoFor the two years I went without washing machines, showers, fridges, cookers, TV or a flushing toilet.His desire to experience the tough reality of le in these societies is perhaps unsurprising given his previous holiday destinations have included North Korea, Chernobyl and the annexed Crimean Peninsula.Despite the dficulties faced by the communities he assisted, Dominic was struck by the gratitude and positivity he encountered.

Valley.Warrington-based WHP Telecoms plans on erecting a  metre-high G tower on Deephope Hill, just off the B between Eskdalemuir and Ettrick.The plans have largely been welcomed by local residents, who cite the current lack of mobile phone signal as a detriment to both the quality of le in the valley and the ability of businesses to thrive.However, they also attracted nine letters of objection, which cited concerns over the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.One supporter, Ogilvie Jackson, of Selkirk, appeared before Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday to urge councillors to support the plans.He told the committee: ldquoWe have been lobbying very hard to get mobile coverage in the valley.ldquoFor the last three years our neighbours at Ettrick village have enjoyed good coverage due to government funded masts that tower over the settlement.ldquoThe mast before you will give us near perfect G coverage for the Ettrick Valley.ldquoThe proposed site could not be better. In fact compared to some masts in the Borders itrsquos very discreet.ldquoMany motorists have been stranded and unable to secure help because of the lack of phone signal. This mast will make our valley a safer and more self-reliant place to live.ldquoI would say this to the objectors: itrsquos easy to object to a phone mast just because you donrsquot like phone masts. If that happened everywhere there would be no mobile coverage in the country.Councillors sitting on the planning and building standards committee were advised by planning officers that the benefits outweigh the impact of the mastBarry Fotheringham, the councilrsquos principal planning officer, told the committee: ldquoThe proposed mast and associated equipment form part of a national programme to deliver a new mast network and telecommunications coverage in hard to reach areas in Scotland that do not benefit from mobile telephone connectivity.ldquoThe proposed mast will be visible in the landscape but it is considered that the benefits of having a strong telecommunications signal in the Ettrick Valley outweigh the limited and localised landscape and visual impacts.ldquoThe proposed mast will be future-proofed so that it can accommodate other users and G networks.

It was decided by those in high office that the gold-plated cockerel weather vane should be re-plated and that the Selkirk Town Clock should actually be removed for repair and cleaning. That clock and its illuminated front face were well maintained over many years by local jewellers and clock repairers and in more recent times has been well maintained by Ritchies in Edinburgh without recourse to actual removal from the building.This time the entire mechanismwas lowered by jib-crane and taken on a lorry down to England for a complete overhaul. That was fine and no-one noticed as the whole building was enveloped in scaffolding and plastic sheeting.However, when it didand was re-installed in its original place all was not what it seemed.In fact it has never kept time since it was put back in the Town Hall. Sometimes it simply doesnrsquot keep time, sometimes it doesnrsquot go at all and, even worse, it goes backwards!What happened to the role of Clerk of Works in all this turmoil and who signed off the work which was then proved to be faulty in the extreme with the steeple now leaking water where it had never leaked before and with huge double front doors that after ldquorestoration couldnrsquot be opened Is Selkirk actually taking a step back in time Are our Councillors backward Who knows, but come the Common Riding morning letrsquos hope Selkirk Silver Band big drummer John Nicol has a watch that keeps good time or neither the First Drum nor the Second Drum will ever take place!But in the middle of all this confusion I have recovered another great mystery, or is it mysteries What happened to the works of Selkirkrsquos mason-astronomer James Scott who was born in Midlem in  and died in November . Who was he and how did he acquire the title mason-astronomer  We have to rely on an interesting little booklet written by Bowmont Weddell, M.A., F.E.I.S and who was headmaster of Selkirk Public School in the s when he wrote and published the pare which was printed by Walter Thomson in High Street.James Scott was born at ldquoThe Burn in Midlem and followed his father and grand-father into the building trade as a stone-mason after school at Midlem.His hobby was the repairer of clocks and from that he became a builder of time-pieces and studied not just the time of day but also the universe and how it worked and related to time and movement.James was totally self-taught but among the books and manuscripts he read was a lecture paper by the City Astronomer of Edinburgh, William Peck. The stone-mason cum clock repairer got even more interested in the stars and planets and their movements to each other and became so knowledgeable that he could predict the phases of the moon and work out on a nightly basis where its place in the heavens would be.That saw him on a journey in which he designed and built, first of all, his ldquoGreat Clock which told the time accurately while at the same time represent the solar system and the relative movements of the stars and planets around the centre-piece, the sun. Included in this masterpiece are the signs of the Zodiac and through its  spaces this Great Clock tells the time, the placings of the planets and a pointer also displays the date and the year.He developed several clocks, long before the advent of digitisation and modern technology. Some of his works were famous and his Astronomical Clock formed a centre-piece of The Scottish Natural Exhibition in Edinburgh in .The ldquoGreat Clock and his elaborate but extremely accurate ldquoJupiter Clock which spelled out the movement of Jupiter and the rest of the planets in relation to the Sun and Earth, were kept locally and by the date that the Rector of Knowepark Public School, Mr Weddell, wrote his paper in  these valuable inventions were part of the fabric of Selkirk Town Hall, in custody of the people of Selkirk as a tribute and a memorial to a one-time stone mason and self-taught astronomer and clock maker, James Scott.The question is ldquowhere are they now They are obviously parts of Selkirkrsquos heritage and Selkirkrsquos past but also a glowing tribute to what can and should be done even today by people with the right attitude to their own environment.If a tin shed half way down The Green, built as a garage, can in any way be classed as Common Good Property and of any value to the burgh, then all efforts should be involved in finding out where these inventions of James Scott, the Selkirk Mason-Architect are now.These clocks are certainly worthy of the title Common Good property."},{"url":null,"title":"expect-cues-as-sporting-greats-set-for-book-festival","story":"SNOOKER legend Stephen Hendry canrsquot wait for this yearrsquos Borders Book Festival.The seven-time world champion leads a pack of sporting heroes appearing at the Melrose event next month.And he will be bringing the action from many World Championships to le as he discusses his book, Me and the Table.Hendry told us: ldquoI am really looking forward to come down to the Borders.ldquoIrsquove visited two or three times over the years to play snooker, but it has been so long since I was last there.ldquoThe book festival should be a really fun event.

Itrsquos a tiny hill, and many people walk past without noticing it, as nature has covered much of it under a blanket of overgrowth.But close up Irsquove always thought it appears mysterious. It is made up of agglomerate, which is the remains of volcanic ash all mixed up with bits of other rock and stone, then solidied and compressed over millions of years.But in places the agglomerate rock looks like it could be the ancient rubble built walls of an old ruined castle. Steps now lead to the summit, and despite the smallness of the hill, the view from the top is quite spectacular.I could see Fidra Island basking in a shimmering sea when I climbed it in the evening of Easter Monday. I reflected that Robert Louis Stevenson must have once stood on this exact spot as he viewed what many say was his inspiration for Treasure Island.But my purpose that beautul evening was to find lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo. There was a local tradition that a small cave-like cavity on the north side of Yellow Craig bore this name, and although the origin of the tradition is lost, it was clearly linked to William Wallace.I found reference to this tradition in an old account from over  years ago in the Haddingtonshire Advertiser by a Mr Jamieson. However, it was brought to my mind when I read of the refurbishment of the Wallace Monument. As part of this, there will be the Luumlbeck letter on display, written by Wallace and sent to the merchants of Luumlbeck in .Wallace, it seems, was in East Lothian at the time this letter was composed. And it was this connection that sparked my memory of the reference to lsquoWallacersquos Mutton Holersquo on Yellow Craig and set me on my quest.But it was in the dying embers of the day we arrived, and I had limited time to explore. The kids had fallen asleep in the car and I think my long-suffering we was content to relax while I scrambled around a rock at the tail end of a fun but exhausting day.As I headed through the wood alone to the craig, the sun was already beginning to lower its head. The sound of birdsong was a crescendo naturersquos melody for spring.Yellow Craig wood isnrsquot ancient, most trees are around  years old. But there are some, mostly sycamores, which are clearly much older. They have exotic shapes and their twisted limbs and scaled bark make them look like fossilised dragons. Perhaps they are. There is one which grows close to the play park that even looks like a serpent.These older trees give this wood an ancient feel. There are also Scots pines, mostly along the edge of the wood. They are descendants of the great Caledonian Forest which once covered most of the north of Scotland. Patches of emigrant Scots pine can be found all over East Lothian and at Yellow Craig they seem to guard the wood from northerly gales, and they are bent and shaped by the wind.Scots pines also stand guard at Yellow Craig itself. When I arrived I didnrsquot initially head up the steps but scrambled up the northern slope, looking for Wallacersquos Mutton Hole.The meaning of this term is a subject of debate, and I claim no academic authority, but I wonderit could come from the term lsquomootrsquo, which is an old Anglo-Saxon word meaning debate or discussion. A moot hall was a room for this purpose in a medieval building, but Wallace was a guerilla fighter, so could this meeting place have been his moot ha If this was so, perhaps Yellow Craig was a meeting place, where Wallace and his followers once met to discuss strategy. Could the idea of the letter to Luumlbeck have been decided here, as they cast their eyes across the sea from the vantage of the rock Itrsquos an interesting idea, but of course therersquos no historical evidence for it. Yet most of what actually happened in those times has no historical evidence.I couldnrsquot find the hole or hollow, as nature has claimed the slope and thick vegetation meant I was kept away from the recesses hidden behind. Perhaps winter would have been a better time to search.But I was not disappointed. I sat on the summit and my instinct told me there was a mystery here that remains untold. A scant and seemingly forgotten oral tradition is not much to go on. But often an ancient half-whispered tradition has grown from a seed of truth.There is a similar East Lothian connection to Wallace in the Garleton Hills. I have written of the Wallace Cave there and the traditions associated with it. There is enough connection to our national hero in East Lothian to say our landscape can also claim connection to him.I will search deeper for references to Wallacersquos Mutton Hole at Yellow Craig andmy findings to this pagemy search proves fruitful. But regardless of the results of this search, for me Yellow Craig will always be a place of magic contemplation and imaginative possibilities."},{"url":null,"title":"worlds-oldest-golf-scorecard-from-musselburgh-up-for-auction","story":"Estimated at pound,-,, the card, which has been framed and mounted, dates from December , .It shows that a Mr Cundell played the five holes within the Musselburgh race track twice, a total of  holes in  strokes.

The vibrato owes everything to the fragility of the line. Temple Grandin, the Elvis of her specialist subject, the self-styled anthropologist on Mars, is strong, certain, convincing.ldquoI have built a fulfilling le, she says. ldquoBut I see too many kids left in the basement. I want to see kids being successful, not locked into their problems.Grandin is speaking in a break between meetings at Colorado State University where she is a professor in animal science. She is an expert on animal behaviour and advises the livestock industry. She is . She is also autistic. Greta Thunburg, the -year-old Swedish girl, has become the unwitting face of autism as she has become the centre of a media maelstrom over her comments on climate change but Grandin has been innovator, influencer and inspiration for decades.ldquoIf I could snap my fingers and be non-autistic, I would not ndash because then I would not be me,rsquo she once said.So who is Temple Mary Grandin and why does she matter in the world of autism The answer is complex, perhaps even profound. It is most simply told by Grandin herself in a series of books and by those who have observed her and listened to her. Oliver Sacks, the neurologist who wrote Awakenings, profiled her in the eponymous An Anthropologist on Mars. Grandin told Sachs that she was baffled by complex emotions, adding: ldquoMuch of the time I feel an anthropologist on Mars. She is also an evangelist on Earth. She takes her lessons, experience and views on autism to conferences all over the world, coming to Glasgow on May .ldquoIs she the innovator or the populariser of a way of approaching autism  says Jim Taylor, an experienced practitioner in the field. ldquoIs she the Elvis in terms of bringing a message to the masses  Her books changed our thinking. She is immensely influential.It is oddly moving to study Grandin before beginning to appreciate her importance in a world where certainty remains elusive, where the severity of the condition fluctuates wildly. ldquoNo two autistic people are the same, she says. She is particularly singular.The scion of a wealthy family, she was viewed as having problems at an early age. ldquoI had no speech until I was four, she says. ldquoI had early intervention speech therapy when I was two and a half. The autism diagnosis came much later because you have to remember this was  . It was a long time ago and the diagnosis was not there but I had all the symptoms.She could not talk at a young age, but was not silent. She hummed, muttered, screamed. The speech therapy was spectacularly successful. But many of the behavioural aspects remained. She could be disruptive in class, even violent with those who labelled her ldquoweird and who taunted and bullied her. She was taught by her mother that her actions would have consequences, with sanctions on her watching television when she was particular naughty. When she was older in further education, she realised her peers became friendly towards her when they appreciated her talents.ldquoFor me, I see too many autistic people with that as their primary identity. I am visual thinker, she says. And what is that  ldquoWhen I was young I thought everyone thought in pictures, she says. ldquoMy brain processes everything in pictures.She thus sees problems. This is most stark when presented with plans for, say, a processing plant. She can envisage what might go wrong by viewing the reality of the project in her head rather than on a planning board. In The Way I See It, her personal look at autism, Grandin recounts how he she ldquotest ran a piece of proposed equipment in her head. She found severe flaws and argued with the engineer. She was proved right. ldquoNow I realise his problem was not stupidity: it was a lack of visual thinking.A major turning point for her was a visit when she was a teenager to her auntrsquos farm. Grandin had endured panic attacks at the thought of going. But she went and found a link to the world that has continued, indeed, strengthened day by day.ldquoIt was all about getting exposed to something, she says. ldquoYou get interested in in things you are exposed to. Itrsquos simple. I was exposed to cattle on my auntrsquos farm and I became interested in them.This interest is commonly conflated with obsession. But a more productive way to view it is that some autistic people have extraordinary levels of concentration and of enthusiasm for subjects.ldquoI came from a non-agricultural background. If I had not gone to my auntrsquos ranch then I would never have got into cattle, she says.She views her work as a vocation. ldquoMy le would be horribleI didnrsquot have my challenging career, she told Sachs.THIS stunning, sobering statement points to the importance of Grandin as both educator and example. ldquoWhen I first started out in serious learning, one of things that was the big motivators was that I wanted to prove I wasnrsquot stupid. A big motivator, she emphasises. She, of course, gained a doctorate and a rewarding career in both academia and business but Grandin also learned that the spectrum of autism was wide and little understood.ldquoThere are a lot of people running businesses who are autistic. I think Steve Jobs was on the spectrum, she says. She has previously said that Albert Einstein displayed symptoms. ldquoOne of the huge problems with autism, she says, ldquois the broad spectrum that encompasses a wide degree of abilities.She adds: ldquoThere is a gigantic, huge spectrum. It goes from someone who is capable of being an artist, to someone who is capable of doing a skilled trade to someone who cannot dress themselves. And thatrsquos the problem, especially for service providers.She also points out that many people may, unwittingly, be on that spectrum. ldquoI am finding grandparents are coming up to me at my talks and they are realising they are on the autism spectrum when the grandkids get diagnosed, she says.According to the National Health Service website, the definition is: ldquoAutism is a lelong condition that affects how people communicate and interact with others. Autism affects people in dferent ways. But most autistic people see, hear and experience the world dferently from people without autism. Autistic people may be given a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or Asperger syndrome.This is the broadest of brushes but Grandin has the most precise strokes in both describing her autism and using her experience to help others. ldquoI can do things, she says. ldquoI sewed dresses when I was . I cleaned stalls at my auntrsquos farm, I studied and I learned about animals. She talks about finding a childrsquos specic area of strength, pointing out that most have an area of expertise and interest. Focusing on their deficits does nothing to prepare them for the real world, she says.HE crouches close to diminish the effects of a cacophonous coffee machine in a motorway service station. It is not quite the crackly Colorado line but the message is similarly clear. ldquoTemple was one of the first autistic people to write a book about her le, says Jim Taylor, who has been a practitioner in the condition for  years. ldquoShe changed our thinking.He edits her signicance briskly into three areas. ldquoTemple has credibility. Itrsquos like who is better between Messi and Pele. Messi can do everything Pele can do but when Pele did it nobody had thought of it, he says. ldquoThere are things that I would attribute to Temple that have changed our practice. Temple was probably the first person who said: lsquoI think in picturesrsquo. If you walk into school with autistic children, you learn the truth of that immediately. Show them a picture, it works.ldquoSecond, she was probably the first person who told of the sensory impact of autism. She talks about strange gait. Her mother would dress her in a taffeta dress in the fties and she would walk funny because she was constantly aware of it so affecting her walk.ldquoThirdly, she upped the game. She increased the ambition. Autism is not an impairment. JP Morgan are not taking on people with autism because of charity but because they see the talent.Taylor, who will chair the Glasgow conference, adds: ldquoWe want to talk to her about raising ambition in unemployment. Most people believe kids with autism have behavioural problems and what Temple taught us is with the right circumstances, the right opportunities, the right communication and, in her case with a special interest, you can take off. You can fly.There are limitations on the most profoundly affected but Grandin has lessons she believes apply to many.ldquoToo many kids are getting addicted to video games and going nowhere, she says. She is fascinated by technology but believes recreational use has to be restricted for those autistic children.ldquoBut the first thing to do is to teach kids how to work, she says. ldquoI want them to look at career options. This work needs to start when they are -years-old. They donrsquot have paper routes in the USA any more so it could start with something like dog walking. They need to learn to do a task, on a schedule, outside the family.ldquoThe second thing is that the kidrsquos strengths have to be developed. Find out what he or she can do. I know there is a spectrum and % per cent of the kids are very severe, will never talk and have dficulty dressing themselves. But others can do mathematics, work computers, think visually and be artists or scientists.ldquoI see too many kids getting babied and they donrsquot learn basic skill such as shopping, bank accounting, hygiene.ldquoThey can do a lot more than you think they can do. There is an attitude of: lsquoTommy has autism so we will order food in the restaurant for himrsquo. Little Tommy needs to do that.She also believes autistic children must be taught how to interact with others. ldquoYou teach social skills like teaching someone how to behave in a foreign country, she says.All this is said without any hunt of superiority. In books, lectures and interviews, Grandin points out that her le has presented her with problems. But she has overcome the most vexing with her capacity to achieve in the face of what would seem insurmountable odds.Asked when the turning point came in her le with the condition, Grandin replies: ldquoThe person with autism always keeps learning. There is no magic turning point. I had mentors ndash my mother was wonderful and I was helped from an early age by her and my elementary school teachers ndash but no turning points.If this seems gloomy, the voice is strong from Colorado. ldquoI have had a good le, she says. ldquoSo I know it is possible for others, too. Autistic kids can have good lives. I have.She told Sachs: ldquoAware autistic adults and their parents are often angry about autism. They ask why nature or God created such horrible conditions as autism, manic depression and schizophrenia. However,the genes that caused these conditions were to be eliminated there might be a terrible price to pay. It is possible that persons with bits of those traits are more creative, or possibly even geniuseshellipIf science eliminated these genes, maybe the world would be taken over by accountants.This statement mixes the sly humour and the serious business of Temple Grandin, academic, writer, inspiration, autistic person, animal scientist, probable genius. And accountancy agnostic."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9798375.jpg?type=article-full","title":"hundreds-of-scots-expected-to-join-class-action-over-mis-sold-clydesdale-bank-business-loans","story":"Claims management company RGL has lodged an initial lawsuit on behalf of about  former business customers of Clydesdale, but say ultimately there could be more than  claimants.

If only we could get together and do something about it. The old are lonely because families are distant and communities lack community. The young are lonely because, instead of meeting people face to face, they interact with the world online.Adolescence has always been a potentially lonely time because one is both more self-conscious and more open to judgment regarding clothes, hair, skin condition, musical tastes and a whole host of matters that always tempted a lad or lass to stay in their bedroom until it was all over and they could emerge as fully-fledged adults. Personally, Irsquom still looking forward to that day.The advent of smartphones and similar devices has increased the temptation to stay lonely through connecting online.Earlier this year, a study by Kingrsquos College London found that loneliness blights the lives of young adults in both urban and rural areas, and regardless of gender of socio-economic background. Last month, figures from the Office for National Statistics found that  per cent of  to -year-olds were ldquoalways or often lonely.Oddly enough, this week, a report by TalkTalk claimed that half of teenagers believed social media and the internet made them less lonely. Perhaps TalkTalk would say that. They also said that it was parents who worried more about their offspring feeling alone because of technology.Whatever the case, loneliness is becoming the biggest issue of the st century, apart from that other one about the planet going down the Suwannee.Also this week, digital media website Vox had an interesting interview with Susan J Matt, of Weber State University, USA, one of the authors of a new book called Bored Lonely Angry Stupid, which examines ideas of loneliness and boredom before social media.The authors noted that boredom was a th century concept. Before that, people accepted that ldquofeelings of empty time, as Dr Matt put it, were part of human experience. Loneliness was ldquosolitude and seen more positively.In the th century, the advent of radio was held to alleviate aloneness. But perhaps it could be argued that it had the same effect as social media: it kept people in the house. The digital age, meanwhile, promises connection but, by and large, doesnrsquot deliver it in a truly satisfying way. The hope, however, keeps us connecting ndash rather than going out.Dr Matt notes that reliance on electronic connection makes us less self-reliant, a quality prized by previous generations. At the same time, it promotes a narcissism that would have been frowned upon in the recent past. It encourages attention-seeking ndash and anger when that attention is negative.Adolescents have always desperately wanted to be liked. Now, they desperately seek ldquolikes. And, actually, that applies to people of all ages who posture online. No need now to stand up in a public hall and say your piece. Just tweet it, preferably from behind a pseudonym.Politically, we no longer gather in the public square. We revolt in the privacy of our own homes. Both John Lewis and Marks and Spencer have reported a massive decline in sales of their pitchfork and burning brand ranges.All of which has political ramications. Last year, bewildered by the absence of proletarian revolution despite repeated provocations, Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May announced plans to alleviate loneliness and ldquosocial isolation.Hitherto, Tory strategy on this has been limited to encouraging more people to visit food banks or welfare interrogators. The new approach appears to involve health initiatives in England and reminding ministers to bear the issue in mind when making policy decisions.The Scottish Government is also working on the issue, and unreliable sources tell me a new programme called ldquoBetter Together will be launched later this year.Ultimately, I suspect, that ndash like everything  ndash itrsquos a matter of finding balance. And you can only detect that yourself, ironically enough.If you expect governments to do it for you, yoursquore on your own, Irsquom afraid.***WHATEVER will these dastardly Russians get up to next  This week, a beluga whale turned up off the coast of Norway wearing a harness for a Gopro camera holder that was sourced to St Peterburg.The suspicion is that it had been trained by the Russian navy to engage in spying missions. The Russians have been accused of many things in their pursuit of world domination but this was certainly a new one: bleedinrsquo belugas.Itrsquos apparently the case, though, that theyrsquove caught and trained the beasties for nefarious purpose. This one repeatedly approached Norwegian fishing boats with an expression on its face that said: ldquoCan you get this ruddy thing oaf ma heid The harness was tied on really tightly and, once it was removed by the fishermen, the delighted beastie gave indications that it wanted to defect.Much paranoia surrounds Russia, but it is undoubtedly always working on ways to promote evil in the world. Intelligence sources indicate that it isnrsquot just belugas that they use. Itrsquos thought that around  per cent of cats, dogs and budgerigars in Britain are Russian spies. If you have such a pet, I suggest you keep a close eye on it.***THERErsquoS a feeling abroad that politicians are not like the rest of us, that they are not of the people.That suspicion intensied with the sacking of Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson after he was accused of leaking details about Theresa Mayrsquos plan for the Communist Chinese to take over Britainrsquos phone network.It wasnrsquot the sacking that intrigued me. To be quite candid with you, I donrsquot really keep up with politics ndash such a lot of nonsense. But Mr Williamsonrsquos personality and habits set alarm bells ringing.For a start, he kept a Mexican tarantula called Cronus in a glass box on his desk. I donrsquot need to tell you that Cronus was a Greek god who castrated his dad and ate his own bairns. Wersquove all done it. But we donrsquot keep big spiders on our desks.Also, when he was Tory whip in charge of party discipline, he said this: ldquoI donrsquot very much believe in the stick, but itrsquos amazing what can be achieved with a sharpened carrot.

Surely this demonstrates that the decline in any new Scottish currency will be signicantly greater than that experienced by sterling in recent times. Of course, it is noteworthy that because of the UKrsquos persistent balance of payments deficit sterling has been freely floating, with the exception of the fixed rate ERM debacle, since .Given that an independent Scotland will have a considerably larger balance of payments deficit as a proportion of GDP than the UK, this clearly indicates that the only kind of exchange rate regime that will work in an independent Scotland is a free float.

The council’s Infrastructure Services Committeeapproved the kerbside collection policy and procedures last year, including guidance on how to deal with contaminated bins. Any non-recyclable material placed into the recycling bin is classed as ‘contamination’, which could spoil the recyclates in any load. The recycling reprocessor may then reject whole loads as a result. Any rejected loads of recycling are disposed of at an additional cost to the taxpayer, for which there is no council budget available. Income which they would have generated to invest in services is lost.Collection crews will now visually check each recycling bin for contaminated recycling before emptying as a matter of course – those with severe contamination will not be emptied. Households consistently presenting severely contaminated bins will be offered advice and support to properly separate their waste. Those who ignore that advice could run the risk of their recycling bin being removed.Moderately contaminated bins will be emptied and an orange tag will be attached, providing information to the householder on how to properly use the recycling service. If a bin has not been emptied and tagged explaining why it has not been emptied, it is contaminated and the offending materials must be removed before the next collection. Crews will notto empty a rejected bin until the next scheduled collection day for the same bin.Bins considered to have little or no levels of contaminants will be emptied as normal.Collection crews will keep a record of bins unemptied due to overloading or contamination and this will be checked before a decision is made toto empty any bin reported as a missed collection.For those with a lot of recyclable materials, additional, free recycling bins can be requested by contacting the council’s Wasteline.

Also among those present was Janine Miller, we of Australian national Greg Miller who also lives in Orkney.This year the wreath was laid on the final resting place of –year–old Royal New Zealand Navy Volunteer Reserve pilot, LieutenantThomas Noel Bush, who was tragically killed on December , .Lt Bush’s Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter plunged from the sky above Kirkwall straight into the Peedie Sea — while, only yards away, people were in their homes, or going about their daily business.On that fateful day, Lt Bush arrived to pick up the aircraft and, following a few pre-flight checks, took to the air.However, within minutes witnesses heard the aircraft`s engine revving at high speed and, from a height of approximately ft, it ed straight down into the Peedie Sea, killing the pilot instantly.Local emergency services and personnel from HMS Sparrowhawk were quickly on the scene, but nothing could be done for the unfortunate pilot.Lt Bush’s body was recovered from the wreckage and he was buried, with full military honours, in St Olaf`s Cemetery, on the outskirts of Kirkwall, on December , .Kirkwall branch of the Royal British Legion chairman Dougie Manson said: “Those who died came from far and wide to serve their countries overseas, coming here today is the least we can do to remember them. It is important that we mark the sacrice they made.” vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The naming ceremony is planned for September .Graham Sinclair, chairman of the council’s development and infrastructure committee, said: “Like the celebrated explorer John Rae, some fitting names from Orkney’s past feature on the shortlist for the new vessel and I would encourage folk to take part in the poll.“With harbour business thriving in Orkney, this is an opportune time to replace an ageing pilot launch with a more modern, capable, and reliable vessel. Like her predecessors, she will give us the capability to deliver a -hour, year-round pilotage service in the very challenging waters around Orkney. This greatly benefits the economy of our islands.“I look forward to the outcome of the vote and hope that as many folk as possible take this opportunity to choose the name for a vessel that will become a familiar sight in local waters.”As well as the online poll, you can send your preferred name from the shortlist by post to Pilot Vessel Poll, Harbour Authority Building, Old Scapa Rd, Scapa, Kirkwall KW SD.

I want it to work in the best interests of the whole of the UK. That’s why I was in Aberdeen yesterday to discuss this directly with businesses.I want to explain why I think this ambitious and pro-business blueprint will drive up wages and boost the Scottish economy.We will scrap the cap on the number of skilled professionals who can come to Scotland. We will also abolish the outdated requirement to advertise jobs in the UK for a month before hiring from overseas for highly skilled workers.This means that hospitals, oil rigs, banks, tech firms and other organisations will be able to access the talent and skills they need from all corners of the world.As part of our new system, we will widen the definition of skilled workers to allow more people who will add value to our businesses and economy to be eligible to enter. Anyone with the equivalent of Scottish Highers will be eligible to apply under the new skilled workers route.: Why Scotland must create ‘friendly environment’ for migrants – leader commentAnd there will continue to be no limit on the number of international students who can come to study at Scotland’s world-class universities – such as St Andrews, which was ranked in the UK’s top three universities just a few days ago.It’s vital we have a constant pool of foreign talent coming into the country, which is why we are introducing measures to make our universities even more attractive for prospective students. Under the new scheme, undergrads and postgrads studying at Scottish universities will be able to stay for six months after finishing their degrees to find work. Those who have completed a PhD will be able to stay for a year.As part of this ambitious plan, we are speaking to businesses, employers and partners right across Scotland to listen and ensure the new immigration system works for them. Yesterday in Aberdeen, I spoke to business leaders from the thriving industries of energy, fishing and agriculture. We’ve met hundreds of stakeholders so far this year, and we will have met thousands by the time we introduce the new immigration system in . We’ve also set up advisory groups, involving the Scottish Government, Scottish Chambers of Commerce, Universities Scotland and others. We have had detailed discussions about how this will work in practice.Although  may seem like a long way off, I’ve already made changes to make the UK more welcoming since becoming Home Secretary a year ago. I removed the cap on doctors and nurses coming to the UK so our NHS could recruit as many as they need – creating thousands of extra places for other sectors too.: Brexit: Nicola Sturgeon brands Theresa May ‘disgraceful’ after EU immigration commentsI announced reforms to help the most innovative entrepreneurs and investors come to Scotland and where in the UK. And I’ve made it easier for top architects and international researchers to bring their expertise.We’re also making it quicker for tourists arriving at Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports to enter by introducing by the summer of this year e-Gates for travellers from Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea and the United States, which allow visitors to pass quickly and securely through border controls.We remain a truly welcoming nation – and that welcome extends to the more than , EU nationals who have made Scotland their home. We’re helping to protect their rights through the EU Settlement Scheme, which we have made as easy as possible to use.These people are our friends, neighbours and colleagues. We want them to stay and are doing everything in our power to get it right.Scotland also has a proud heritage and has a long history of being an open and welcoming nation as well as a trading nation. It exports products which are in global demand, from Scotch whisky to Scottish salmon and much more. I believe the new immigration system will help Scotland invest in the skills it needs to continue to thrive, driving productivity because it is built around the skills that people bring – not where they come from. It will have fairness and compassion at its heart, and I am confident that it will ensure Scotland continues to prosper for many years to come.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland team in a world cup panini sticker album again leader comment","story":"There is growing excitement around Scottish football.

Scotland is on the rise and the end of the UK is nigh and we are taking our country back.”Broadcaster Lesley Riddoch, one of those taking part in the march, said she thought the turnout had been much larger than the figure estimated by police, with many people leaving the march before the final gathering at Glasgow Green.Askedthe event would help convert those undecided about independence, she said: “It reinforces people’s sense of confidence who are Yes campaigners. I don’t think it probably changes a lot of people’s minds at all. “As someone who grew up in Northern Ireland and has a great sensitivity to people marching around streets, the good-natured way this was conducted shows we are a reasonable bunch of people.“I don’t think anyone is pretending that disrupting traffic in a major city gives people a warm and fuzzy feeling about your cause. Plenty of other things add positive messages.“The main thing is to get people together to show there are those all over Scotland who feel the same way and are prepared to go the extra mile – disrupt their weekend, get themselves organised, hire buses, get their banners – and then walk for quite a long time.

A phone call from Brydon Thomason to Alastair Wilson, the Scottish Natural Heritage warden, alerted folk to them heading north off Westing, which triggered a mega sprint across to the coast where they were able to look down on about four animals including a male.To be able to see them close to is a memorable experience, but to be able to look down on them underwater even more amazing. Such oppor­tunities don’t come often. They were also seen to catch a seal in the bay at Lund, and photographed by several folk during their progress north, and so hopefully can be identied by the team that are still up here researching the distribution and abundance of killer whales around Scotland.From photographs, it has been established that an orca seen off Cullivoe, north Yell, on the evening of the th July, is a big male known as  or “Bigga”.Next day, the same inidual was identied at hrs heading north through Yell Sound.Some of our showiest plants are in flower just now. “I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows …” wrote William Shakespeare in “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. And indeed I do. There’s a fantastic bank near me where the pale mauve flowers of thyme are pushing through between the bell heather, itself with some plants paler than others.Common heather is not so bold in its colouration, but works in mass production, and will soon be colouring the hills with subtle shades. The third in the trio of obvious heathers is cross-leaved heath, whose compact flowerheads drooping from a single stem are pinker in colour.Changing colour, two striking plants are now in full bloom – angelica and meadowsweet. Although names for meadowsweet in dferent coun­tries all translate as “queen of the meadow”, it seems that its name actually comes from its use in flavouring the drink mead. Also in the days when hygiene was not quite so good as now, the plant with its rather nauseating scent was spread out on the floors of houses to counteract unpleasant odours. A Shetland name is “blackenin-girse”, from its use for dyeing wool.From the showy to the opposite – demure and unnoticed is a little plant with a big name that is very common about gardens, steps and roadsides: procumbent pearlwort. This low, hairless, tufted perennial has its base as a non-flowering rosette. However, the name pearlwort is said to come from the tiny, pearl-like white, long-stalked flowers whose sepals are actually longer than the usually four petals. In folklore it is said to have special powers of protection. So next time you go to pull out this so-called weed, just give it a closer look first. Maybe its powers of protection will rub off on you!"},{"url":null,"title":"li","story":"The Liberal Democrats claimed by far the highest number of Shetland votes in Thursday#s European elections, gaining roughly twice the number of nearest rivals the SNP.However, the isles# effort was unable to save the Euro seat of Lib Dem George Lyon, who was likely to be replaced at Brussels by UKIP#s David Coburn.Returning officer Jan-Robert Riise at the European Election count.

I always thought it would but it#s possibly exceeded my expectations.#I#m extremely delighted for George Lyon and just hope that it can be replicated down through the country.#George Lyon is a very, very good MEP, interested in the rural areas, and I just hope he gets back again.# raquoShetland#s slide to the right in the past few years reflects what is going on nationally and internationally, but needs study.yuns de longest contribution yet Brian, du better hae a mandatory rest period noo ta big desel up ageen.UKIP got the seat,great news !I wonderhe#ll be like the outgoing Yorkshire UKIP man who hardly attended any debates in the parliament, or like the new one, who#s said this morning he won#t attend at all Lets hope we learn not to be so apathetic, we literally get what we deserve. Salmond and Farage, the opposite sides of a nasty #nationalist# coin.And what of British Nationalists Mr Tinkler For example Michael Gove yesterday, banning #Of Mice  Men# and #To Kill a Mockingbird# from school reading lists in England.Can you imagine the SNP doing likewise because the want -% of literature studied to be Scottish Inconceivable.For whatever reason British nationalism # incredibly, even in the form of UKIP # isn#t sneered at the same way as Scottish nationalism.What is your point Carl  Scotland is somehow superior to England because it does not ban “Of Mice  Men” and “To Kill a Mockingbird” from school reading lists. How very petty of you. For information I loathe all nationalism, Scottish, British what is the dference, just raw tribalism by another name.SNP, UKIP, Scottish Independence, United Kingdom Independence, as I said, two sides of a very nasty littlecoin.How verySad andironic, the Scots# inScotland have just elected a UKIP MEP!! I#m glad to hear it Ian.So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration You mean you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century  Nation-states have existed throughout human history and patriotism # or nationalism # is a normal part of human social experience, as evidenced in innumerable great artistic works, for example. Where things go wrong is where one nation-state wants to conquer and control others. But that has a dferent name: imperialism.Well Carl, when it comes to education and this of literature, I would rather have a book written by a british,not scottish, author than this of an american, in which to study or reflect on with regard to literary works used for educational purposes. Quite rightly, these books, written by foreigners##sorry, yanks, should be taken out of the national curriculum and author#s unique to the UK or Scotland selected instead. I must confess, I am a little worried and concerned about the UKIP doing so well in the European Election#s considering Mr Farrage is a more extreme version of the vile Tories, and how he gives the impression of a nationalist, xenophobic buffoon where, I feel,we do leave the EU, he will, like the vile Tories, be in a position to rule and do as he pleases without being answerable to anybody, namely the EU under the European Human Rights Act. Many people may criticize the EHRA, but I would dread to think what this country would be like without it     David, you never fail to amaze me.You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner and then go on to criticise nationalism and xenophobia.You really do believe in taking the scatter gun approach to political philosophy.Without the European Human Rights Act there would be an awful lot less terrorists running round for a start, old hook hands would of been deported along with his pals years ago, The   tube an bus bombings may never of taken place, an Cherie Blair would have a few less £millions in the bank. Any and all of these options are preferable to what we have now.At the last general election when the Lib Dems signed a pact with the Conservatives the writing was on the wall, they blew it big time and will never in the future be able to have an influence on British politics.Maybethey had made a coalition with Labour it might have been dferent but now its too late, any vote for Liberal in the future will be a vote wasted.The study of English literature should, in my view, encompass all literature written in the English language, including its many dialects and historic iations. That should include studying local writers, but not to the exclusion of international authors.We study literature for all sorts of reasons, but bolstering national pride or trashing another nation shouldn#t be amongst them.If we were to go down the road of only studying our own literature, Scots students would never study Shakespeare or Dickens, English students would never study Burns or Lewis Grassic Gibson, neither would study Melville or Twain, and all would be worse off for it.The attack on the English curriculum has come from the dreadful Michael Gove, but it could quite easily have come from Nigel Farage who hates hearing non-English accents, let alone reading non-English texts.UKIP under Farage represents a severely authoritarian threat to our liberty which should not be under-estimated. So far we#ve only seen the tip of this particular iceberg.Farage is married to a German so he hears a foreign accent every day, such a pity you only soak up what murdochs media tell you instead of a few facts.How very true John, they, the LibDems, know how to go out with a bang##so to speak. A prime example of# not what to do in a political career # lolGod forbidthe Libdemsshould go into bed with UKIP, I think that would most certainly put a stake into the heart of the party lol Mind you, lets hope that UKIP do not get to that level of power where a they rule the roost or b contemplate a coalition with another party.I do believe they are in the same league as the Tories with regard to the Scottish Parliament, in that they have  single representative####.. too many in my books lol# you never fail to amaze me. You start off by arguing that teachers should be banned from using any book written by a foreigner # lol Malcolm, I was being slightly sarcastic in my response to what literature teachers should be using to teach with ###.but on a more serious point, I do not see why teachers cannot use books written by scottish or british authors to demonstrate literature and its meaning##..within and between the lines. I am sure, as you might agree, there is just as equally good examples of literature within the boundaries of our own country or the UK in which to use for educational purposes  I wasn#t specically saying every foreign book should be banned##.it was, as said sarcastically, yank#..sorry, american in the context of the subject.Theo Smith and the other  Shetland Lib-Dem voters might explain why they like it so much. But they won#t.Are you unable to express your own views Brian  because that link is your longest post by far.Carl Pickard, in answer to # Ian. So you are pro-EU and pro-immigration # I am strongly forUnity of all humanity, that does not mean I carte blancheagree with of all the attemptsand mechanisms to forge those unities by politicians. However the EU is a vast improvement of what went before it. WW and WW were the result of the preceding collection of sovereign nation states.On balance I there for do support the EU, however there are grounds to improve it, not demolish it. I most definitely agree with immigration and the opening of borders to all friendly states and cultures..Britain has benefited hugely due to its ersity of cultures.If anyone advocates banning immigration and sending #them# home, would they expect all UK and Scottish ex pats to be expelled from wherever they are and be sent backThat would be fun would it not I would expect to be deportedfrom whatever country I was in other than my ownI broke their laws. I would not expect that country to feed clothe and house me, nor would I expect free everything, maybe that#s just me as I don#t expect this country to do that for me either . Instead of hysterical rantings of they want to send them all back try actually listening to what they say instead of what the murdoch media say they say.A new experience # Iagree with Ian Tinkler.Robert Sim, in answer to # you loathe most of human society from the ancient world to the st century# I certainly do loath the primitive mentality which is soblind and stupid to realise most of human suffering is simply because Nation States and nationalistsare collectively too selfish to look beyond theirown self interest and belief in racial superiority.. Nationalism is a prime example of that and Salmond and his NATS a great example. Our oil, we are better, fairer, alone we would be wealthier, ect,ect and all that self righteous rubbish. Also nationalism goes a bit beyond great artistic works, a few examples : The Holocaust ,Omagh bombing , Bloody Sunday. Ethnic cleansing . Tribal massacresCambodian genocide , these are a few examples of hundreds of incidents..These killings have little to do with imperialism, more about tribalism and a self belief in racial superiority. #The simple fact is we are all the same species with exactly the same ancestry and emotions.# Very true, Ian. In fact, your words remind me of these words from a famous historical document: #We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal##.

We were a support network for each other really.“I knew everything was going well for her le. Her partner Sara meant I never had to worry about Lyra. Everything was in place for her and it is really bad her le has been ended so quickly.”Conall was contacted after the vigil by Susan Curran, who came up with the idea of the walk.“The idea came about quite spontaneously the night after Lyra’s killing in a conversation I had with Conall,” she said.“Conall had organised the vigil but I was late in work that night and really gutted that I missed it. “The idea came in my head of a walk from Belfast to Derry. I just said to Conall let’s do it!“I was just overcome with anger about what happened and fear that we were going back to that.“We are just a group of people who want to react and take action. I have legs, a voice and a heart and that is all I need for the walk.“Everyone can take part in the walk in any way they can. We would ask people to challenge themselves. We are asking people to ‘Be more Lyra’.“Our message to people who don’t support us is for them to be honest with themselves and realise the majority of people who signed up to the Good Friday Agreement.“We don’t want any more young people in graves or swayed by violence. We want Lyra’s death to be the last Troubles-related death in our society.“Through the walk, we want to demonstrate the will of the majority of people in our society to reject violence as a means to resolving our issues.“We want to rejuvenate and bring new le into the principles of the Good Friday Agreement which has been broken time and time again. As ordinary people in society, we are fully behind it.“We have very real memories of the Troubles and we don’t want a repeat for our children and our children’s children.“We believe Lyra’s death will be a catalyst for change. This is our generation’s peace walk.”The walk will leave Writer’s Square in Belfast at am on Saturday, May  to walk the  miles to Moneymick in Randalstown for the first camp.On Sunday , walkers will depart at am to walk  miles to Dungiven for the second stop over before completing the last  miles on Mondayto Guildhall in Derry.Brenda Gough is encouraging people to get involved in whatever way they can.“Over  people have registered.

The play tells of the journey of two Belfast women set against the backdrop of the crumbling Floral Hall as they recall the fateful night they met their future musician husbands. Old grudges and sparks fly as they reminisce about the lestyles of their globetrotting other halves who experienced fame and fortune while the wives they left behind struggled to bring up their young families, working all day and spending countless lonely nights. Written and directed by Brenda Winter-Palmer, the production has been developed by West Belfast actress Antoinette Morelli, daughter of showband legend Tony. Inbetween a quick rehearsal break, Antoinette spoke passionately to the Andersonstown News about how she has haboured the project for the past  years and how proud she is to see it come to fruition on The MAC stage next week. “I’m in a wee bit of shock and obviously incredibly excited that it’s got to this stage,” she said. “Brenda had heard my story about daddy and it turned out that Brenda’s daddy was Micky Conlon, a big concert promoter at that time. I commissioned Brenda three years ago to write the piece.“We had a read through last year in the Strand cinema as part of the Eastside Arts festival. David Hull the promoter was invited, he picked it up and this is where we are.”Antoinette plays the character of Rose, “a character that has been inspired by mum’s stories but is not my mum”. “The story is fictionalised and it’s about two couples, two sisters and the impact the showbands have on their lives,” she said. Antoinette continued: “With the Miami Showband story out this year and this production the stories are similar in terms of the showband connection but this is very much from the women’s perspective. “It’s tragic, it’s funny, there are a lot of good treats in there with music from the showband era. The universal heartbeat of the play is our story, the sacrices women made to let their men go off and pursue their dreams. “The Floral Hall is almost its own character in the play, after last year’s reading we had so many people come up to say ‘oh we met there’, people have such good memories of the place.“I know how dficult it is now, in terms of performing, first hand, as my husband is a stay-at-home dad to our -year-old and -month-old. If it wasn’t for him doing that I couldn’t pursue my career so I’m lucky that is he very supportive. I definitely think people will identy with the show.”Keep Telling Me Lies will be performed at The MAC theatre from Thursday May  until Sunday May .

When she spotted the attempted fraud, she checked the banks website for guidance and made contact via telephone as instructed, with the help of her brother.She said the employee who took the call refused her service as she was using her brother as an intermediary on the call.Ms McKendry explained: \"I asked my brother to explain my disability and to ask for a reasonable adjustment to enable me to act quickly on fraudulent activity on my bank account. \"I didnt want my brother to act for me, I wanted him to relay the instructions of the bank employee to me and I would respond via the speaker phone.\"Even though the bank employee said he could hear me, the account holder, he refused me service because I was lip-reading the information the employee provided to my brother via speaker phone. \"I could see attempted transactions happening on my account while this call was ongoing and was extremely worried.\" The bank had blocked the card immediately after her phone call, but following what she saw as a refusal of service, Ms McKendry contacted her bank via secure messaging on its online app. The app said it could take three to five days or more to get a response.Ms McKendry felt the situation was more urgent.The next morning she was invited to meet the branch manager who confirmed that her card had been blocked following her call, her account was safe and missing funds would be reinstated.

Surely a reasonable time to find a steady stream of constituents at the polling stations  Polling stations are usually located in primary schools where, at that time, children would be playing, perhaps that old favourite, hide and seek.Read MoreSuzanne Breen: Five things to watch for when the votes are castInitial Northern Ireland election results expected at lunchtimeThere were no schoolchildren out yesterday, but, in their absence, voters in Belfast who should be there instead had certainly got the hang of hiding. Very quickly it turns into a game of spot the voter.At West Kirk Presbyterian Church on the Shankill Road, there are more election workers for the DUP and PUP than people walking past to cast their votes. \"Its quiet,\" one observes. \"Very slow\".In a -minute period between pm and .pm, only one lady strolls into the polling station.\"We have over  names on the register here. Weve had around  in so far. Thats it,\" Im told.There are, of course, expectations that the trade in the vote business will pick up later in the evening when the working day ends, but things havent got off to a promising start.Over to Cltonville Road, where the local primary school is closed for the day to serve as a polling station.Sinn Fein representatives are on the gate and again there are more of them than voters making their way along the laneway. For  minutes not one person walks past.Im about to give up when a lady finally ambles by.\"I vote every time,\" she says. \"I dont know how many people come out, but they should all be made to.\"I was brought up in a home where my mum and dad always voted. Its right to have a say.\"One or two more move past as we talk.\"Im here because the DUP say no to everything. I want to speak up for myself,\" one man tells me.For now hes a lone voice in the wilderness.As yet, theres no sign of the other main political parties. The UUP, the Alliance Party or the SDLP likely feel their resources are better deployed in other areas of the city.Maybe change is as possible, as some might say, but for now, on the streets of Belfast at least, its the politics of red, white and blue and green, white and gold that continue to dominate. Everyone  is still squeezed to the margins.At Edenbrooke Primary School off the Crumlin Road, which has a catchment electorate of over , voters for both the Oldpark and Court wards, you wouldnt say the flow was steady - to call it a trickle would be pushing it.\"I have the right to vote and I want to use it,\" says one man. \"I dont agree with much our politicians say, butI dont vote I cant complain.\"That says a lot. Voting so he has a right to complain.Its a sad indictment on our country that its got itself into such a sorry state that voters just dont seem to care.Perhapsour politicians were seen to do something meaningful, that spark of enthusiasm would reignite.In the meantime, the cure for election hangover is that old traditional hair-o-the-dog. A bit of the same to ease the pain - European Parliament elections are just around the corner, on Thursday, May .That may be more interesting to voters as the Brexit card comes back into play and some of our political big-hitters are on the canvass trail, but you suspect an overbearing sense of apathy will prevail again and the only excitement will be amongst our schoolchildren, who will be getting another day off lessons.The Electoral Office described voting yesterday as \"steady\". Turnout reports from polling stations at pm yesterday ranged from a low of % in east Belfast to as high as % in one venue in the north of the city. The final turnout in the last council elections, in , was just over %."},{"url":null,"title":"sdlp in jubilant mood as party profits from sinn feins derry loss","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

They described “body storage on the floor of the mortuary” following a “surge in activity”.Speaking in Co Westmeath on Friday, Mr Varadkar said there were dfering accounts about mortuary services and that he had no reason to doubt the veracity of any of the accounts.“If that’s the tone I struck orthat’s way it came across well I regret that,” he said.“I’ve always encouraged people to raise issues andpeople have issues about the services they work in bringing them to the attention of management is absolutely the appropriate and right thing to do.”He added: “The only thing I said in recent days is that there were dferent accounts and I didn’t want to be calling any staff member dishonest or questioning the veracity of anything anyone said.”Sinn Fein has called for an independent inquiry into the claims.Waterford TD David Cullinane said there were many questions that needed answering.In a second letter written by the four pathologists in Waterford to the SSWHG they describe ‘body storage on the floor of the mortuary’ and risks to ‘staff, visitors and the public’. This beggars belief. pic nPlYcAJQA— David CullinaneMay , “How can that be the case in  that bodies were left on the floor of any mortuary and surely the Taoiseach has a responsibility to establish the facts,” he asked on RTE’s News at One programme.He said his concern was for the families who are left wondering whether it was their loved one that had been left lying on a trolley.“We want an independent inquiry on behalf of those families in Waterford and the south east who deserve the truth and deserve the facts,” he said.Planning permission for a new mortuary at Waterford Hospital was granted in .

the fth largest in the world - subcontracts the negotiation of its trade dealsJeremy Hunt“We have an adversarial system in Westminster and it’s in our DNA not to co-operate with each other.“But I think the glimmer of hope we have in this situation is that both Conservative core voters and Labour core voters want Brexit sorted, and both would be extremely angry with the party they voted forwe had another general election without Brexit being delivered.”He added: “This is a very exceptional time and there are substantively dficult issues, but I don’t think it’s impossible.”Askedhe would support a customs union compromise as part of the discussions, Mr Hunt said: “I’ve never believed that a customs union is a long-term solution because how could you expect the EU, for example, to stand up for the rights of Scotch whisky distillersthey were negotiating a trade deal with the United States or Japan, even though the UK had absolutely no say in that trade deal \" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt visits Kibera in western Nairobi “There’s no example anywhere in the world where a large economy like the UK – the fth largest in the world – subcontracts the negotiation of its trade deals.“But I think that what Labour really want when they talk about a customs union is the benefits of a customs union: friction-less trade, to facilitate issues around the border in Northern Ireland and manufacture and supply chains, and we want that too.“So,we can find a solution that delivers the benefits of the customs union without signing up to the current arrangements, then I think there will be potential.”He said that while he supported the Prime Minister’s deal, there may be things that can be done to make it “more acceptable” to Labour without compromising on the “things that we think are essential”.Mr Hunt warned thatpoliticians do not resolve Brexit then they will have “failed as a political class” in doing what Labour and the Tories promised at the last general election.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Jeremy Hunt speaking alongside Kenyan foreign minister Monica Juma at a press conference in Nairobi He also said it was “still not impossible” to pass the Withdrawal Act before May .“That is what we are all desperately hoping for because it’s not going to be pretty for any of the big partieswe have to fight these elections.“If we don’t have the Withdrawal Act in law by May , that is what will happen.”Elsewhere, Environment Secretary Michael Gove issued a renewed plea for MPs to back Mrs May’s deal.In a speech to the Scottish Conservatives conference, Mr Gove said: “It enables us to leave the EU while safeguarding essential interests and liberating us to enjoy new opportunities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"tens of thousands take part in rally after march for independence through glasgow","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Cllr Curran said space in an existing refrigeration unit is exhausted and more is required.Meanwhile, former South Down MP, Margaret Ritchie, who recently visited Ardglass, is also pleased that local fishermen can now fish in Dundalk Bay.She thanked the Minister for Fisheries and Marine in Dublin, political colleagues in Daacuteil Eacuteireann and SDLP leader Colum Eastwood for making representations to ensure legislation was enacted.She added: ldquoThis will ensure that fishing, which is the leblood of the Ardglass community, can continue unhindered. This is also good news for the local economy.Development plans for Ardglass include relocating Ardglass trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the village harbour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Artist chosen to display work at renowned exhibition in Dublin  ","story":"A DOWNPATRICK artist who is the youngest ever member of the Ulster Water Colour Society is to exhibit in Irelandrsquos biggest and most prestigious art exhibition next month.Connor Maguire has recently been selected to show his self-portrait entitled lsquoMan in the Hatrsquo at the Royal Hibernian Academy in Dublin. It will be the second time he has been chosen to exhibit along with Irelandrsquos finest artists.The  year-old mdash who is a former De La Salle High student mdash says his painting is a side profile piece which was completed in oils on canvas. Out of a total of , entries submitted to the exhibition, only  or so are successful.Connor was shortlisted last year for the Zurich Portrait prize where he was only one of  artists throughout Ireland to be up for a winning prize of two thousand euros.This gave him the opportunity to exhibit in the National Gallery of Ireland which he describes as being ldquosurreal and a dream come true.Connor said: ldquoOne of my earliest memories is of me scribbling away at a table with my grandfather, Broderick Maguire.ldquoMy grandfather, an accomplished draughtsman, carpenter, designer and painter, could do anything that he applied himself to and introduced me to pencil drawing and charcoal. He inspired and captivated me, seeing what he could accomplish with a pencil and a paintbrush. I attempted to paint as good as he did and believe Irsquom still trying.Connor continued: ldquoI recall my art teacher at high school, Mr McLaughlin, was a terric influence on me too. It was one of the few classes I actually enjoyed.ldquoAfter A-Levels, I took up art at the University of Ulster and have been painting non-stop since. I won the Chairmanrsquos Award in , and have went on to win the Stephens Award, Anna Cheyne Award and Carnathan Galleries Award.ldquoI work three days a week at the Assumption Grammar as an art technician. I work with the students, helping them explore print making and they seem to love it.Connor also works steadily as a freelance artist, specialising in painting from watercolours to oils, printmaking in the form of woodcuts, linocuts, drawings in charcoal and graphite exhibiting, and in case he might have a spare moment or two, he is a professional picture framer too.Most of Connorrsquos paintings are inspired by themes of portraiture and he has a keen eye for figure and character in familiar settings like a simple family meal. He takes inspiration form the essence of someone which he can capture through some serious study.Taking part in the exhibition, which is now in its th year, is another stepping block to Connor gaining recognition on the international stage where interest has been coming from American art curator, Didi Menendez and the RJD Gallery in New York.Both notable art critics and buyers who he has been in contact with could well result in him exhibiting further afield.Connor has also took part in BBC Radio  programmes talking about his work with broadcasting journalists, Perminder Khatkar and Helen Marks.Last year he featured on BBC rsquos lsquoThe Arts Showrsquo talking about his work with Marie Louise Muir.He says it was a ldquocool feeling to be featured alongside actor Ciaran Hynds who was featured in the same programme.Connor was shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  in association with Artists  Illustrators Magazine, exhibiting in Londonrsquos prestigious Mall Galleries alongside some of Britainrsquos greatest artists.He was also shortlisted as Artist of the Year in  with the same magazine. winning the West Dean College Award exhibiting again in the Mall Galleries in London.This RHA exhibition will catapult Connor further than he can imagine and said hersquod like to concentrate on portraiture and introduce more figures into the paintings on the theme of realism and experiment on learning new things in printmaking with woodcuts and etching.More of Connorrsquos work can be viewed on his website www.connormaguire..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Bid to boost tourism in Downpatrick area  ","story":"MORE emphasis on tourism promotion across Downpatrick and Lecale has the potential to signicantly enhance the districtrsquos economy, according to a UUP candidate in tomorrowrsquos local council election.Alexander Burgess, who is contesting one of the five seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick DEA, believes more needs to be done to make the most of the arearsquos unique link with St Patrick.Mr Burgess, who was recently joined by his party leader, Robin Swann, on a visit to the centre dedicated to Irelandrsquos patron saint in Downpatrick, is confident that furthering St Patrickrsquos links with Downpatrick and wider Lecale can help promote new business opportunities, including hotel and bed and breakfast accommodation.He is also delighted that planning permission was recently secured for a major new hotel at the site of the former Abbey Lodge development at the Belfast Road on the outskirts of the town.ldquoTourism is the districtrsquos number one economic driver and we are blessed with so many fantastic places to visit in Downpatrick and across the wider district, said Mr Burgess.ldquoMany areas would give all they had to have such an important link with St Patrick. Downpatrick boasts Irelandrsquos only centre dedicated to him but I believe more needs to be done to fully exploit the tourism potential the patron saint offers us.Mr Burgess said additional overnight accommodation in Downpatrick and Lecale was crucial to assisting any new drive to encourage more people to visit and learn about Patrick and the arearsquos rich Patrician heritage.He said having spoken to many people during his election canvass, it is clear there is simply not enough tourism accommodation at present.ldquoIt is rather ironic that while Newry, Mourne and Down Council has quite rightly put tourism at the top of its agenda, there is simply not enough accommodation for people to stay. It is an issue that needs to be addressed, continued Mr Burgess.ldquoThere are already thousands of people visiting the St Patrick Centre every year and how great it would bethere were more places for them to stay to fully exploit what the area has to offer. We already have the Ballydugan Mill hotel on the outskirts of the town and a number of bed and breakfast providers, but we need to capitalise on the lucrative overnight market by providing more bed spaces.Mr Burgess said he hopes that when day-trip tour operators arrange visits to the St Patrick Centre that they will allow additional time for tourists to visit town centre shops, cafes and restaurants..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Burgess calls for new centre to be opened  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to open Saintfieldrsquos new community centre immediately.The call has been issued by Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess, who is concerned that weeks after work on the eagerly-anticipated Belfast Road centre was completed, the entrance gates remain locked and the ultra-modern facility lies unused.On the eve of tomorrowrsquos local government election, the Recorder understands that while several opening dates were suggested, agreement could not be reached between the ious parties and that the new centre is not expected to open until the end of this month or early June at the earliest.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is scheduled to hold its annual meeting on May  and it is understood that the new centre will not open before then.A local authority spokesman said as the organisation is currently operating under the restrictions of purdah mdash imposed in the lead-up to an election and which restricts councils from making major announcements ndash the opening will not take place until after the local government poll.Cllr Burgess insists he sees no reason why the centre was not opened before now.ldquoIt is my understanding having spoken to senior council officials that all the work has been completed and it is simply a case of opening the centre. I have also been told that the centre could have opened in February. We are now in May and the entrance gates remain locked. This simply isnrsquot on, he declared.ldquoThe delay in opening a centre which the people of Saintfield helped deliver is inexcusable in my book. Over poundm has been invested in the project and while building work has been completed, the cross-community facility remains closed.Cllr Burgess said there was ample time to arrange the official opening of the centre before purdah kicked in and ahead of tomorrowrsquos election.ldquoWhen the council finally gets around to opening a centre which it has allowed to remain closed for several months, it is essential that it invites all those associated with the project, in particular, those involved with the proposal from the outset.ldquoA lot of people have invested considerable time and effort in this project and it is vital their collective efforts are recognised at the official opening.Cllr Burgess added: ldquoThe people of Saintfield and indeed further afield are perplexed as to why the centre has not opened. Perhaps after purdah ends, Newry, Mourne and Down Council will tell the districtrsquos ratepayers why there has been such an extraordinarily y and, in my opinion, totally unnecessary delay.A local authority spokesman confirmed that no date has yet been agreed for the official opening of the new community centre in Saintfield.He added: As the Council is now operating under the restrictions of lsquopurdahrsquo the centre will not open until after the local council elections have taken place..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch by pass  ","story":"CALLS have been issued for a start on work on Ballynahinchrsquos new poundm by-pass.It comes just days after major gridlock on the main approach roads to the market town over the Easter holiday period in Ballynahinch which is used as a gateway by visitors to Newcastle and the wider Mournes area in particular.Roads officials say they are keen to get on with the job of building the near two-mile by-pass linking the Belfast and Newcastle roads, with Rowallane Ulster Unionist candidate, Walter Lyons, insisting this must happen now.As part of the multi-million project, major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road in Ballynahinch.Mr Lyons said the by-pass must be delivered not only to ease town centre gridlock in Ballynahinch, but to encourage new investment and attract more visitors to the area.ldquoThere is no doubt that traffic congestion in the town centre is an impediment to new retail and commercial investment in Ballynahinch and it must be so frustrating for people from Belfast and other areas who have to make their way through the town during bank and public holidays and over the summer to sit in long tailbacks, he said.Mr Lyons, who was recently joined by UUP leader Robin Swann who was visiting the town, said the campaign for the townrsquos by-pass started  years ago and that the scheme must now be delivered.ldquoMoney has been made available for other major road schemes in Northern Ireland while Ballynahinch continues to wait, he declared. ldquoThe congestion in the town centre was as bad as it has been for many years on Easter Monday and we need to address the issue.ldquoIt is clear that the congestion problem is not only impacting on investment in the town but local tourism. My fear is that people will not want to come to our districtthey are continually caught in traffic snarl-ups.Mr Lyons said log-jammed streets could also impact on the ability of the emergency services to respond to major incidents, should one arise.He added: ldquoCongestion in Ballynahinch impacts on a much wider area yet progress on delivering the much-needed by-pass is painfully slow. It is my understanding that the project cannot move to the procurement and construction stages until the necessary funding is available. This needs to happen.ldquoWe need a financial commitment to build the road to benefit the entire district. The congestion is not solely a Ballynahinch problem but,solved, has the capacity to provide major benefits. We have been told that the scheme is shovel ready so letrsquos get on with the job of building the road.Mr Lyons said thatelected to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, delivering the scheme will be one of his key priorities.

They came up with the idea to host a fundraising event within their school involving students wearing a bright jumper to school on Blue Monday, January .They raised pound which went to supporting early intervention strategies towards young people. As a result, these students appeared in a video which was created by Action for Children and was shown to MPs and MLAs at Stormont to raise awareness of mental health issues towards young people and the need for extra government funding.The runner-up in this category was Lara OrsquoNeill, Head Girl at St Maryrsquos High School in Newry.The Innovation and Creativity Award category was won by the Slurrysafe team of Conal Murray, Matthew Isaac and Connor Kelly, from South Eastern Regional College in Downpatrick.The boys, all from farming backgrounds met at an engineering course and decided to tackle the risks associated from slurry by designing a slurry alarm after an incident affected one of their families.Their design dfers by linking the alarm to the tractor engine so that when the alarm sounds, power to the tractor is cut off which stops the slurry mixer. This alerts the farmer and a sensor sends a message to a mobile phone of the risk.The runners-up in this category were Assumption Community Link mdash students at Assumption Grammar School who have been innovative in establishing a community link with local primary schools in the Ballynahinch area.They have supported children in the local area who have high levels of illiteracy and innumeracy and struggle with socio-economic hardship.

completing work on an environmental improvement scheme in Irish Street in Downpatrick has been branded a ldquodisgrace by a local politician.Councillor Dermot Curran has this week called for an urgent meeting to be arranged between traders and senior officials from a number of government departments involved in the project to discuss what went wrong and what can be done to ensure the project is completed as soon as possible.Last week the Recorder revealed that Irish Street traders are furious that work on the project is to take more than twice as long to complete than originally planned.Work to provide new paving, street lighting and street furniture was due to complete at the end of March, but contractors will not now be finished their work until the end of June.And, to compound tradersrsquo frustration, once contractors move off site, Irish Street will be completely closed to traffic for a short period to allow the main road to be resurfaced, taking the scheme into July.There have been a series of issues associated with the regeneration scheme with the initial start date delayed as Phoenix Gas took longer than expected to complete its work at this part of the town.Signicant issues have also arisen with the foundations for the blast wall which surrounded the former police base and problems with the sewer network.Cllr Curran wants senior representatives from Newry, Mourne and Down Council and the Departments for Infrastructure and Communities to meet with traders and insists that NI Water must also be represented.ldquoThe public realm scheme has been delayed by over three months, raw sewage has been running down the street and, most shockingly, traders have not been kept abreast of the reasons for the delay, he declared.ldquoThe Irish Street project was due to complete inside three months but it will now be early July and what those responsible for the work do not realise is that businesses are being affected across the town, not just those in Irish Street.Cllr Curran said the delay in completing the scheme is having a major impact on the town centre, revealing that he has heard reports that the number of people using the Irish Street car park has reduced since work on the public realm scheme started.He said with trading conditions dficult enough at the best of times, the last thing business owners need is for the one-way system remaining in place in Irish Street for another two months.ldquoThe delay in completing this scheme is nothing short of disgraceful and questions need answered. In addition, traders should be provided with weekly progress briefings as a matter of courtesy. The fact this has not happened is deeply disappointing, Cllr Curran continued.The local politician said the temporary one-way system is impacting on traffic volumes in St Patrickrsquos Avenue and Market Street in particular, with some shoppers opting to avoid Downpatrick as work on the public realm scheme continues.Cllr Curran also suggested that the delay in delivering the public realm scheme would ldquosimply not be tolerated in any other area. He claimed that taking twice as long to complete a scheme would not be accepted in areas like Newry, Lisburn or Belfast.He declared: ldquoMany businesses in Downpatrick are suffering as the result of an unacceptable delay. The clear evenings are now here, so why canrsquot contractors be asked to work longer to complete the scheme sooner ldquoWhile I accept that the delays may be the result of unexpected circumstances, surely the trick is to come up with imaginative solutions to get the work completed as soon as possible  The suggested completion date at the end of June needs to be reassessed now.Cllr Curran said he plans to contact the ious government departments and agencies to arrange a meeting with Irish Street traders and hopes it will take place as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle park needs management strategy  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council officials have been asked to develop a management strategy for an open area at the rear of Newcastlersquos Donard Park and adjacent woodland.The request has been made by Mournes councillor Willie Clarke, who recently tabled a council motion urging the local authority to contact the Annesley Estate with a view to leasing land it owns at this part of the town.Cllr Clarke is keen for this to happen to enable the council to maintain what he described as an ldquoattractive area to complement existing amenities in Donard Park.He believes the council can help play a key role in improving the recreational, health and well-being of local people, in tandem with enhancing the resortrsquos tourism potential,the area and its important habitat are managed properly.While his recent motion was referred to the local authorityrsquos Economic Regeneration and Tourism Committee for debate, Cllr Clarke said that,re-elected, one of his key priorities will be shaping the future management of a ldquo fabulous landscape and woodland, preserving it for future generations.He continued: ldquoThe upper green area needs to be incorporated in the future management of Donard Wood, while the pathways and signage for visitors need to be improved for visitors entering the main route used by hill walkers heading into the Mournes to climb Slieve Donard.ldquoIn the short term, I have made representations to council officials to carry out maintenance improvements at the Shanslieve Drive entrance to Donard Park where visitors are greeted by rusting litter bins, council signage dating back to the s and a potholed surface.Cllr Clarke said these are improvements that need to carried out immediately.Also this week, he has called on the local authority to repaint the historic archway at the entrance to Donard Park car park.He said: ldquoRepainting the archway will also improve the appearance and aesthetics of the entrance into Donard Park and I have requested that the work is undertaken as quickly as possible, Cllr Clarke added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Newcastle rock star’s intimate solo album  ","story":"THE discovery of a random white feather gave The Answerrsquos frontman Cormac Neeson a sign of hope at the most desperate time in his le mdash and the inspiration for his first solo album.The Newcastle rocker has just released a searingly intimate and personal album called White Feather with ten tracks which deal with his eldest son Dabhoacutegrsquos fight to be born and for le itself.Launching at Belfast venue The Black Box on May , the  year-old will give his most stripped back performance as an artist as he tours with the album over the coming months.His old friends, The Unholy Gospel Band, with bass guitarist, Downpatrickrsquos own Eamon Hanlon, will be joining him for the big night.Cormac also has a new single out from the album, Broken Wing, a country-inspired track with blues backing choir that will resonate with people whether they are a parent or not.His rock vocals have given way to a deeper, introspective sound that is still etched with emotion.The  year-old singer, who once toured with rock legends AD DC, says he the experience of nearly losing his son from being born prematurely at  weeks has changed him.Dabhoacuteg, who has Downrsquos Syndrome, weighed only lb oz when he was born. After spending his first four months in a hospital neo-natal unit and undergoing heart surgery on his first birthday, he is now four. Thankfully, Dabhoacuteg has turned the corner despite overcoming serious medical obstacles in his short le.Dabhoacuteg and his  month-old brother, Conall, mean everything to Cormac and his we Louise, who now live in Belfast.ldquoWhenever you have a sick child and you go through an ordeal like that with your family, it does definitely alter your perception and you come out the other side of it changed, said Cormac.ldquoYou just look at le in a dferent way. You appreciate stuff that you never appreciated because yoursquore not sitting in an intensive care unit in the Royal [Victoria Hospital]. Anything is better than that.The couple only had a few weeks to privately celebrate getting pregnant with their first child when Louise had to be rushed into hospital.They initially were advised that pregnancy was lost as it was so early but were told to come back to hospital in a few weeks time.ldquoIt was the longest two weeks in my le, recalls Cormac. ldquoThe night before we were due to go the hospital I went out for a walk in the Mournes. I was a bit raging at the world and screaming up to the heavens asking to be give a sign that everything was going to be ok.ldquoI was literally stopped dead in my tracks with this little splash of white high in a tree. I climbed up into the tree to see what it was and it was a white feather.ldquoI had always been brought up to believe that white feathers symbolised new le. I couldnrsquot believe that I spotted it at that time and brought it back down. I had a feeling then that everything was ok. The next day we went to hospital and sure enough there was this tiny mustard seed on the scan with the most giant heartbeat you ever saw in your le. It was the beginning of what was to be a most tumultuous journey and the beginning of where we are now, having an amazing four-year-old and a baby.ldquoDabhoacuteg really is a warrior. Hersquos been through more than me and most people ever will in their lives.Long-term fans of The Answer may be surprised at one of their leaders heading to Nashville to write and record the album.But as Cormac tells it, itrsquos just the way it was meant to be.He went to the home of country music in  on a songwriting course to help write songs for other artists but ended up literally pouring his heart and pain out in the songs mdash in time-honoured country music fashion.ldquoItrsquos not a country record but you can tell it is recorded in Nashville, said Cormac.ldquoThere is an awful lot of soul to it and a bit of subtley to it as well as it allowed me to express myself in the way that I needed to at this point in my le. I needed to make a record that reflected that switch in the way I see le.The Nashville approach to writing songs was a more reflective experience for Cormac that what he is used to with bandmates Paul Mahon, Mickey Waters and James Heatley.ldquoIt was just a completely dferent approach to songwriting that I had been used to doing for  years with The Answer, said Cormac. ldquoItrsquos a hard rocking blues band and a lot of our songs are written with the volume pedal turned up rfing away, having a good time and letting songs organically develop.ldquoIn Nashville, you sit in a room with two other people and an accustic guitar and you have a long conversation about your le and what you might want to write about. I found once we were locked into the message we wanted to put across in the song everything  fell into place. We basically wrote songs in the morning and recorded in the afternoon as thatrsquos what the studio expected.ldquoA lot of what Irsquom singing about on this record just would not work on a record from The Answer because it wouldnrsquot be appropriate. Rock and roll is loud and le-affirming. While a lot of these songs are le-affirming, they are in a completely dferent way.Cormac assures the bandrsquos devoted following that they have stockpiled a supply of new songs and will be coming out with a new album.Addressing his own personal hiatus, Cormac added: ldquoIrsquom still the same guy I was in The Answer and will be again when The Answer makes our next record.

Sands struck with all the stealth and power that her dad Noel displayed for Down hurlers for many years as she beat Katie Smith all ends up with a clinical finish.Meath were now on the ropes and Sands delivered a second knock-out blow a minute later when she again ghosted in to direct a McCartan pass to the net and give down a - to - interval lead.Meath had the wind advantage after the break, but it was Down and the unrelenting McCartan who took centre stage.Two sensational points from the Castlewellan teenager, a daughter of former Down All-Ireland medal winner Greg in , stretched Downrsquos lead to seven points with only five minutes of the second half played.All credit to Meath, they steadfastly refused to throw in the towel and a Foley point left them trailing - to - after  minutes.It wax at this stage that Savage played a real captainrsquos role from her central half back role. She was simply imperious, plucking the sliotar out of the air and then sending it forward for her team-mates to chase.Meath went close to giving Down a fright in the rd minute when an explosive shot from Fagan rattled off the crossbar and was cleared to safety, but other than that, little got past Savage.McCartan and Leonard swapped points as the game drew to a close, but Down had no intention of relinquishing their grip on the game and refused to give Meath any more scores.Down: Niamh Sharkey, Orlaith OrsquoRourke, Hannah Toner, Alice Coulter, Isabella OrsquoHare, Blanaid Savage, Niamh Dempster, Megan OrsquoBoyle, Anna McKee, Cerys Clarke, Sorcha McCartan , Saoirse Sands , Gerra McGrattan, Aoibhinn Brentnall , Beth Fitzpatrick.

The message must go out that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.Cllr Andrews said many people worked hard to persuade the local council to redevelop the Westlands play park and are bitterly disappointed that their commitment and dedication to the local community is not shared by others.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoshocked to learn that play equipment had been damaged describing those responsible as ldquothoughtless vandals.He continued: ldquoAll councillors worked hard to deliver this upgraded play park for the community and to see it so needlessly damaged in the first week it has been open is so disappointing and adds to the ongoing anti-social behaviour problem in Crossgar.Cllr Brown said he met with Mr Teggart at the play park to inspect the damage and discuss how the local authority and PSNI can stop such ldquoreckless behaviour in the future.He added: ldquoThis sort of action cannot continue and those responsible will be held accountable..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Voters take to the polls  ","story":"VOTERS go to the polls across the district tomorrow to elect  councillors to Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Seventy one candidates are contesting the seats up for grabs in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob, Mournes, Crotlieve, Slieve Gullion and Newry areas.With the final day of canvassing already underway and candidates targeting any remaining undecided voters, all eyes will be on the magical turnout number which could decide success or failure for some.Turnout in the  council election was just over % which saw almost , people visiting polling stations across the district.As the local council prepares for its second four year term, Sinn Fein and the SDLP will be battling to become the largest party and it is certainly all to play for.Both parties currently have  councillors with Sinn Fein sources quietly confident that the party will have increased its number of seats once the final result has been declared.What is clear is that the final outcome of tomorrowrsquos election is the toughest to call in decades given the number of interesting battles taking place right across the district.Locally, all eyes will be on Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and The Mournes which are intriguing to say the least, with the outcome potentially resulting in a dramatic change in the political landscape and some high profile figures losing out.In Downpatrick, attention will centre on the battle between Sinn Fein and the SDLP for electoral supremacy in an area where five seats are available.The SDLPrsquos Dermot Curran, Gareth Sharvin and John Trainor are out to retain their seats, with Sinn Fein aiming to ensure that Oonagh Hanlon and Jordan Madden will secure seats on the local authority for the first time.However, Independent councillor Cadogan Enright firmly intends to retain his seat, with strong support from a number of leading community groups in Downpatrick and Lecale.Add Aontuacute , the Green Party , Alliance , the DUPand UUPinto the mix and the expected dog fight for the fth seat could well be decided by transfers.In Rowallane, Independent candidate Martyn Todd and Sinn Feinrsquos Marianne Cleary will try to upset the current status quo in an area where the five seats are shared between the DUP, UUP, SDLP and Alliance.Sinn Fein has never held a seat in Rowallane before, but clinching one in a traditional unionist stronghold would represent a seismic sht.The SDLPrsquos Terry Andrews topped the Rowallane poll in , but was only  votes ahead of the UUPrsquos Robert Burgess, who is confident his running mate, Walter Lyons, who polled  first preference votes five years ago, can join him in the debating chamber.Lyons is the only Ballynahinch-based candidate contesting the poll, with DUP sources confident that Billy Walker and Harry Harvey will retain their seats. But with no TUV candidate, what will the  voters who backed Philip Hamilton in  do this time around Independent candidate Todd is expected to eat into sitting Alliance councillorrsquos Patrick Brownrsquos vote, with the Green Party intent on making an impression through Emma Cairns. Aontuacutersquos Liam Mulhern is contesting his first election and with  candidates chasing five seats the election count will be a particularly nervous affair.In Slieve Croob, the SDLP is keen to grab two of the five seats up for grabs with current encumbent Mark Murnin, the local councilrsquos current chairman, joined by party stalwart Hugh Gallagher.Sinn Fein has made its intention clear by fielding three candidates. Republicans currently hold two seats through Roacuteisiacuten Howell and John Rice and are aiming to ensure through the partyrsquos tried and trusted vote management system that Drumaness woman Cathy Mason will also secure a seat.Sitting DUP councillor Garth Craig is not seeking re-election with the party selecting Maynard Hanna to defend his seat, while Alan Lewis is flying the flag for the Ulster Unionists.Alliance currently hold a seat in Slieve Croob through Andy McMurray but he surprised many byopting to stand in the Mournes area, with his position being contested by university graduate Gregory Bain from Clough.The Mournes is another intriguing battleground where former South Down Ulster Unionist MLA Harold McKee is bidding to make ato local politics and the SDLP is aiming toits sitting councillors, Laura Devlin and Brian Quinn.However, Sinn Fein has an eye on one of the SDLP seats and is fielding three candidates, sitting councillors Willie Clarke and Sean Doran alongside Leanne McEvoy.Henry Reilly topped the poll in  while standing on a UKIP ticket. Now an Independent Unionist, he looks set to retain his seat alongside DUP stalwart Glyn Hanna, with all eyes on Alliancersquos Andrew McMurray following his switch from Slieve Croob..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Zak tops Wicklow qualifiers  ","story":"NEWCASTLE ACrsquos Zak Hanna has been selected to represent Ireland in the upcoming European Mountain Running Championships which take place in the scenic Swiss town of Zermatt, at the foot of the world famous Matterhorn Mountain.Living on the slopes of Slieve Croob outside Dromara, Zak travelled down to Wicklow on Saturday to compete in the trial race which would select the team to travel to Switzerland.With this yearrsquos race an uphill only race, compared to last yearrsquos championship being an lsquoup and downrsquo race, runners competing in the trial started at Crone Woods car park on the edge of the Wicklow Mountains and climb along the Wicklow Way trails before entering the open mountain and begin the long and steep ascent to the summit of Djouce Mountain at  mabove sea level-similar to running from Newcastle to the top of Slieve Commedagh.Zak summited Djouce in first place with a good gap over the second-placed runner to add another Irish cap to his list..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9807642.jpg","title":"life without art would be empty and unsatisfying","story":"JC: What is your artistic background JC: What inspires your art JC: Is there a specic place that you do your work JC: What has been your most ambitious piece to date JC: What dferent artistic media do you use and which is your favourite JC: What are you currently working on JC: Do you exhibit your work anywhere JC: Any new artistic ventures planned for  JC: What are you up to when you arenrsquot painting JC: What does your art mean to you This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Its church centre at Finaghy Road South will be set up to offer tea and coffee and toilet facilities to spectators as well as water and jelly beans for participants. They have also entered three relay teams in the race.Support worker at the non-denominational church on the Lisburn Road, Neal Spence, said: “We’ve embraced it. It’s a fantastic opportunity – we’ve got thousands of runners and spectators coming past the front door of our church.“We’ll have a chance to chat to some of the people who have come out to watch from Finaghy about some of the things that we have on at the church.”He continued: “Being a Christian is about imitating Jesus. Jesus was out on the streets, he met people, he engaged with them, he helped them, he gave them a glass of water. We want to be practical in our faith.“Whenever Jesus walked the earth he had the religious elites giving off at him for helping and healing people on the Sabbath. He rebuked them for that. Unfortunately there is still a lot of that religion about rather than embracing this le to the full.“God has given us abilities and talents and the joy to be able to go out and run, for good causes. There’s a lot of good coming out of this marathon.”He said: “I know there’s been complaints, people wanting Christians to boycott it because it’s on a Sunday.“For me, my Christian faith isn’t confined to a Sunday, it’s something I live out each day of the week. We’ll have our Sunday service later in the day to accommodate the marathon.“Church to me is more than just sitting in a building singing songs and listening to someone preaching.”\"  \"  Man gets reward for finding lost cash Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Rev Colin Duncan, of Woodvale Methodist Church, said his church would wait and see how the Sunday marathon switch affected services before deciding whether or not to raise an issue with organisers. He said: “The writing was on the wall. We could see the move to a Sunday marathon coming a long time ago. It is what it is, we’ve just got to live with it and make the most of it.“We’ll just see who turns up [tomorrow]. We’ll make a call afterwards. Because it’s the first time it’s happened we don’t know what the impact will be. I think ‘wait and see’ is the same approach as a lot of the churches around here are taking.”He did not wish to comment on the religious implications of moving the event to a Sunday.Owen Crane, of Christian Fellowship Church in east Belfast, believes there are bigger issues that demand the attention of Christians than the Belfast Marathon moving to a Sunday.The senior pastor at the non-denominational church on the Belmont Road said: “People in Sri Lanka are getting blown up. That puts it in perspective. I think we can work round the small matter of a marathon being moved to a Sunday.”He added: “It’s a wonderful event for the city. Normally we’d have gone out as a church and done drinks and cheered people on but because of the time it falls it will be right smack in the middle of our services this time.”Father Michael McGinnity, parish priest at St Malachy’s Parish in Alfred Street, said: “Because we’re a city centre church we have people travelling from all around the greater Belfast area for Sunday worship. We would also get a lot of visitors to Belfast attending our services. “We’ve a very loyal congregation and they’ve probably worked out the way they can get into the city centre at dferent times based on the route of the marathon.“There will be some disruption, but I don’t think it will affect us too badly.”In terms of the decision to move the marathon to a Sunday, Fr McGinnity did not wish to comment.Des McKeown, property steward of First Presbyterian Church in Rosemary Street: “Our church is non-subscribing Presbyterian – we take a very liberal view. On the grounds of it being moved to a Sunday we wouldn’t be opposed in the same way that other churches would be, though there would be a wide range of views at the church. “The main concern for us is the disruption it causes getting people into the church.“We’re a central church but our entire congregation comes from the outskirts of the city, not from the centre.“What we’ve done is printed out maps of the route and handed them to everyone in the congregation on Sunday and asked them to do their best to work their way round it. Obviously we’ll understandthey can’t make it.”Recreation on Sunday ‘saddening’A Free Presbyterian minister who is vehemently opposed to the Sunday marathon switch has said that just because people, including Christians, support the event on the Sabbath doesn’t make it right.Rev Paul Hanna, minister of Mt Merrion Free Presbyterian Church, is one of a group of born-again Christians who took part in a protest against tomorrow’s race at Stormont yesterday .He said: “I would have no doubt that many will support it, but that doesn’t make it right. It’s God’s word, God’s law, the mind of God, that’s the only thing that I’m concerned about. “It’s not about whether my message is popular – it’s whether it’s right or wrong.“Society is the poorer for these things that are creeping in to try and reverse God’s Law.“I do think that Sabbath Day sport has a lot to answer for. Sunday is thought of as a day of recreation, a day to do whatever you like. The Lord puts it very clearly that the Sabbath day is to be kept holy. It’s a far cry from what we see today and it grieves and saddens Bible-believing Christians to see it.Rev Hanna said: “The disruption is not the main thing - it’s one day out of  – the main thing is it’s an affront to God and His Word.“I would say there will be people running in the marathon who would otherwise be going to church. “It reminds me of when we protested at Ravenhill . We were received in a very polite way by most people. We preached the gospel, we handed out tracks, we were very positive. The ones who gave us the biggest opposition were actually the people who had been in church that morning.“It wasn’t the neutrals. It was those who are loosely connected with churches in some shape or form.“We’re not out to rub people up the wrong way. We’re out to try and stand for Christ.”Double up for runnersAlmost , people are planning to run the Belfast Marathon tomorrow – almost double last year’s ,. Until now the record was , runners in .The overall size – including the team relay, . mile fun run and -mile walk – takes the total participants up to around , people with large crowds expected right along the . mile route.Organisers believe the rise in participants is primarily due to the move to a Sunday race. Another key factor, they say, is the new faster course which eliminates the climb on the Antrim Road and will have less isolated areas like the Duncrue Industrial Estate section, where there were no supporting crowds.Switch had been planned for ‘number of years’With regard to the Sunday race, Belfast Marathon organisers said: “The Belfast City Marathon Management Team have been working on changes to both the marathon route and moving the event to a Sunday for a number of years due to feedback from all stakeholders, including athletes, city centre traders and the PSNI.“[We] have undertaken a role of engagement with all relevant stakeholders who could be affected by the new route and have received great support from an array of Churches and denominations across the city. Every effort has been made to minimise disruption on the day.”They added: “The Deep RiverRock Belfast City Marathon is inclusive to all and helps raise more than £. million annually for local charities.”try catch  TrendingIf PSNI had shot gunman who murdered Lyra, the cry would be: lsquoshoot to killrsquoUPDATE on recovery of overturned lorry on NI motorwayN.I. local elections -

On the first day of a two-day count which will continue today, most parties faced a mixed situation across Northern Ireland, with local factors and personalities contributing to the results.Kyle Black, son of murdered prison officer David Black, of himself celebrating with his girlfriend Adele Bradley, after winning a council seat in Mid Ulster.However, the two parties for which things were overwhelmingly positive were Alliance and the Green Party, making gains in Belfast where the centrist bloc is now going to be even more signicant in swinging key votes.People Before Profit, the socialist party, also polled strongly and gained new seats, confounding those who believed that its support for Brexit had fatally undermined its support in largely nationalist areas.The DUP polled strongly but its performance will not be clear until the end of the count. The DUP was delighted to see the election of Kyle Black in Mid Ulster, a victory which was poignant because his father, David Black, was murdered by dissident republicans.The party also made history by seeing its first openly gay councillor, Alison Bennington, elected. DUP veteran Jim Wells had denounced her candidacy when it was announced and then declined to congratulate her yesterday.But Arlene Foster made explicit that she stands behind the decision, despite criticism from the Free Presbyterian Church and some DUP members, and Mervyn Storey, himself a Free Presbyterian, did not criticise her selection but stressed ongoing party opposition to gay marriage.Mr Wells was criticised by former DUP spad Tim Cairns, who said that his comments about Ms Bennington were “repellent”.Tom Smith, deselected as a DUP councillor in Bangor East and Donaghadee after he voted to light up a council building in rainbow colours, retained his seat as an independent — a signicant victory against the party machine.Sinn Féin, which had been expected to take additional seats in Belfast after its surge in support in , came under pressure from People Before Profit, Aontú and Alliance, losing several seats in Belfast and where.The Greens topped the poll in the Botanic area of Belfast, winning a seat, and secured a strong vote in the east of Northern Ireland.Alliance had expanded beyond its eastern heartland to contest multiple seats in the west, and some of those candidates broke through.

three places to Arlene Fosters right at the DUP manesto launch earlier this monthAlthough the two were never formally linked, it was the church which provided not just many of the early DUP candidates, but also the foot soldiers who enthusiastically campaigned for the upstart party which would smash Northern Ireland’s political establishment.There were always criticisms from some in both church and party who saw the tension between a secular party with ambitions of winning votes and a fundamentalist church with the aim of saving souls.But those largely lay below the surface until Paisley’s decision to enter government with Sinn Fein, something which dismayed many in the church, who had been taught to view Sinn Fein in theological terms as the representatives of evil. The church gave Paisley an ultimatum: Choose to remain as moderator or remain as first minister. He opted for the latter and, after  years, was replaced as moderator.In his blistering valedictory interview with Eamonn Mallie in , Paisley said that his church critics “do not have the ear of God on this matter [power-sharing with Sinn Fein]”, a claim which appeared almost sacrilegious to some within the church. He also said that his family no longer entered his former church – although his son Kyle remains a Free Presbyterian cleric in England.Then in December  the church criticised the party for allowing retrospective pardons of those convicted of homosexual offences to pass through the Assembly. In implicit praise of the DUP’s nemesis, the church said that the proposal “was opposed only by Mr Allister of the TUV while sadly many others remained silent”. The church said it was “deeply grieved and bitterly disappointed” at the failure of MLAs to oppose the pardons.Now the uneasy relationship between a party which sees the strategic value in secularising and a church which believes that God’s law is unchangeable have ed with the DUP’s choice of Alison Bennington, a lesbian, as one of its council candidates. Ms Bennington has said she is standing “based on what I can deliver as a councillor ... not based on my sexual orientation”, and it is clear that the party leadership has endorsed what in any other party would be a fairly unremarkable stance.Ms Bennington was chosen centrally by the party, itself an indication that the party was taking a strategic decision to test the waters with its supporters. But for a party which once campaigned under the banner ‘Save Ulster from sodomy’ for homosexuality to remain a criminal offence, it is nevertheless a striking indication of how the DUP is changing.Traditionalist DUP MLA Jim Wells, who is currently suspended by the party, has been outspoken about what he described as a hint of “a major – and very worrying – change in the policy of the DUP on social issues”.On Saturday, TUV leader Jim Allister said he was struck in canvassing “by the number of lelong DUP voters dismayed by what they see as their party’s softening on the gay marriage issue because of the Bennington nomination”.Mr Wells yesterday said that “many, many DUP members up to the highest level”, including MPs, MLAs and former ministers, had been in contact with him to express concern about the issue because it was “a huge change in the ethos and tradition of the DUP”.Free Presbyterian sadness at the political normalisation of relations that contravene Scripture Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The South Down MLA said that there was concern within the party that it was “a step towards other radical change” and that people who had in some cases been members of the party for  years “simply cannot come to terms with this decision”.At the weekend, DUP veteran John Carson, posted on Facebook about the decision. The Ballymena councillor, who is standing for re-election on Thursday, said that he had been aDUP member for  years but “I say quite openly and with no fear of the consequences ‘NOT IN MY NAME’. I first entered politics because of my admiration for Dr Ian RK Paisley and ... I make no apologies to anyone for saying I am an old Paisleyite.”He went on: “I believe in the coming days not only myself but many of us will have some soul-searching to do and some tough decisions to make”. Invoking images of Old Testament idolatry, Mr Carson asked people to pray for wisdom for “those of us who have not bowed the knee to baal” as they “stand against evil in these days”.On Saturday, the presbytery officers of the Free Presbyterian Church issued a statement which was unusually oblique for a denomination known for its full-frontal assaults on those it regards as acting sinfully. The statement, a clear response to the DUP move, did not name the party but said that it “underlines its opposition to all marital and sexual relationships outside the covenant of Biblical marriage”.It added: “Therefore, as a church we are saddened by the attempts of political parties to normalise and promote marital and sexual relationships that are in contravention of the clear teaching of Scripture.”The statement was read out in some Free Presbyterian churches on Sunday, although not in others, in what may be a hint of the church – as well as the party – being split on the issue.Although a tiny denomination, Free Presbyterianism has long exerted an influence which exceeds its size, both through the DUP and its frequent pronouncements to the media about issues of public morals.One church source said that there was a desire among some within the congregation to see DUP party officers who are members of the church disciplined for their role in Ms Bennington’s selection.In response to the church’s statement, the DUP merely said: “Our position on support for traditional marriage is well known and as the party leader indicated last week, it has not changed.”An academic study, published as the book The Democratic Unionist Party: From Protest To Power, four years ago found that the Free Presbyterian Church continued to wield huge influence within the party, with % of DUP members being Free Presbyterian. That meant that Free Presbyterians were  times more common in the DUP than in the population.It has been clear for some time that the DUP is no longer “the DUP at prayer”. Butthe DUP continues on its path to expand its voting base, even the continued high levels of cross-membership of church and party may increasingly become a thing of the past.If that accelerates the DUP’s liberalisation it could be signicant for everyone in Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIN PICTURES |  photos from the funeral of murdered journalist Lyra McKeeSpeeder clocked at mph on

It’s not a unique result.“We have seen the Alliance vote expand across Northern Ireland... places where people traditionally write-off the Alliance Party.“I think what it’s down to is the fact people first of all see Alliance offer positive politics... but more than that, they see what the Alliance Party is delivering on the ground.“I don’t think people were voting for Brexit in the local government election. They know that they’ve got another opportunity to do that in the elections that are still to come on May . So I think Brexit only played a very small part in it.”She said Alliance always hears voters saying they want “more integration”.“And then it comes to polling day, and people get in the booth and feel afraid of what may happenthey change their vote. I think people have reached a point in this election where they feel it couldn’t get any worse.“If I change my vote, how much worse can it be ” Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"NEWA | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"NEWA | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingIf PSNI had shot gunman who murdered Lyra, the cry would be: lsquoshoot to killrsquoN.I. local elections -

But in Northern Ireland’s multi-party system where even the DUP at its zenith has only ever taken % of the vote, small parties can be influential not only in the chambers to which they are elected but in deciding which of the bigger parties’ candidates make it there.The DUP and Sinn Féin remain dominant and there is scant evidence of sustained public move away from endorsing those parties, despite two years without Stormont and public anger at MLAs being paid while not legislating. That is quite an achievement for them.The DUP has particular cause for satisfaction. After a torrid two years of scandal and internal spats, the party seems to have held its ground while smaller unionist parties have failed to do likewise.Sinn Féin has more to ponder. Its  performance, on the back of the RHI scandal, Brexit and nationalist fury at some Arlene Foster remarks, was stunning. But, based on yesterday’s partial results, the upward trajectory has been checked.A combination of People Before Profit, Aontú and Alliance — along with an SDLP which seems to have held its vote better than some pundits expected — has seen nationalist voters channel their dissatisfaction at the status quo in ious directions.But although the DUP will be happy with the first day of the election, there are glimpses of looming risks – but also opportunities for it.The party’s selection of Alison Bennington as its first lesbian candidate was calculated and strategic. The party would have expected a backlash, but might have been surprised at the severity of objections from some traditional supporters.Veteran Ballymena DUP councillor John Carson appealed for people to pray “that this person will not be elected”. Now that she has been elected and the party’s vote as a whole has held up, it is is evidence to bolster those within the DUP who have been arguing that it can liberalise its stance on social issues — at least cautiously — without support collapsing.But beneath some of the headline numbers there are glimpses of future battles for the partyit moves in that direction.Ben Lowry: The DUP now ought to ponder whether it cares most about itself, or about unionismGay DUP candidate Alison Bennington makes history as she clinches victory in election Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"In Bannside, the traditional DUP heartland which gave its name to founder Ian Paisley’s House of Lords title, the TUV saw its vote surge. Having taken two seats in , the TUV consolidated that position. In what may be evidence of disquiet in some DUP heartlands, TUV saw its vote share rise from less than % last time to %.That comfortably eclipsed the DUP’s .% of the vote. TUV canvassers talked about the DUP’s first gay candidate being raised on doorsteps far away from where she was a candidate. If there is a signicant backlash, that is likely to benefit of TUV leader Jim Allister in the European election in three weeks’ time.But the story of the first day of this election count has been the growth of the centre ground. There have been points in the past where it appeared that voters would abandon parties defined by the constitution for a new form of politics. On each occasion, voters have gradually reverted to orange and green.Twenty one years after the Belfast Agreement, the DUP and Sinn Féin framed this as a familiar orange-green contest. Ironically it was a terrorist murder –the sort the Agreement was meant to stop – which disrupted that message and may have persuaded some of those who voted for centrists that they want a dferent Northern Ireland.try catch  TrendingIf PSNI had shot gunman who murdered Lyra, the cry would be: lsquoshoot to killrsquoN.I. local elections -

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They havenrsquot had any unpleasant encounters.ldquoBut itrsquos inevitable as a person of colour, whether they see something on the news or it happens in a social environment.ldquoBefore it gets to that point they should consciously or subconsciously have enough references to their own self worth in media, be it movies, books, or cartoons to handle it.Mr Banda was spurred into writing by a comment made by Tancho after school. ldquoI donrsquot knowit was a book or a lesson, but Tancho made a very generalised comment ndash he said they have no water in African homes so they have to walk really far.ldquoI told him: lsquoYou know Africa is not a country right  They all have their own experiences the same way Europe is made up of a lot of dferent countries.ldquoIt worried me. Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France. It was the boysrsquo optimism that helped us through situations like that and I wanted to reflect that.The books are carried in Grfin Books on Windsor Street, Penarth on Amazon. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The struggling chain has entered into a company voluntary arrangement . It follows a pre-pack administration for the high street business. Five Northern Ireland Debenhams stores are continuing to trade, but it has confirmed  other stores will shut, outside Northern Ireland. It’s thought more than , jobs could be at risk. Debenhams is the anchor tenant at five shopping centres in Northern Ireland, including Newry’s Quays Shopping Centre, Ballymena’s Fairhill, Belfast’s CastleCourt, Craigavon’s Rushmere and Londonderry’s Foyleside. The firm’s earlier administration angered shareholder Mike Ashley, owner of Sports Direct, who has called for the process to be reversed. The administration wipes out the stakes held by Sports Direct and all other shareholders. The stores that are due to close are: Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton, Walton, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon, Witney, Wolverhampton. Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, director Aodhán Connolly, says \"rising costs, a sluggish economy, and changing shopping habits are making le incredibly hard for the industry\". \"Those pressures are being exacerbated by ever-increasing public policy costs which are making it more expensive to employ workers and operate from physical premises. These factors will lead to a very dferent retail industry over the next few years. \"The challenges department stores face are a microcosm of the immense changes affecting the retail industry. As more consumers shop on-line, there is a challenge to encourage shoppers into stores, and then to get them to spend when they are there. One of the big trends we are seeing is retailers innovating to try and create a number of reasons for customers to visit the store. That can be through offering food and drink, dferent services, and by investing in customer service. The big advantage a physical retailer has is those trained helpful colleagues who can provide detailed guidance on products to help customers. \"It’s notable those retailers who have invested in evolving from purely physical retail to a multi-channel offering are those who are in the strongest position. Many of the larger stores are particularly affected by government policy which has consistently made operating from property more expensive. With margins so tight, that tax burden is making le dficult for high street retailers.\"View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Email-640x315.jpg","title":"it firm pinnacle hosting event at kingspan stadium","story":"Posted on Tuesday  April  by Ulster Business A leading IT firm will host an event at the home of Ulster Rugby at an event to help educate and inform businesses.

Corporate lending to Danske Bank customers fell by % during the first quarter of the year as Brexit uncertainty meant customers put off investment, chief executive Kevin Kingston said. Profit before loan impairments was up % to £.m. But corporate lending was down, Mr Kingston said, \"with the heightened uncertainty around Brexit during quarter one persuading some our larger customers to delay planned investments until later in the year\". But overall business banking lending, of which corporate lending is part, had increased by %, mainly to existing customers. The chief executive said many business banking clients had been pursuing growth plans, but that others were extending their borrowing to prepare themselves \"for any economic challenges that could be associated with the Brexit process\".
