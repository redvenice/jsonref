The hut is used by his family for holidays where he enjoys a great time sailing with his children and grandchildren. To own a hut you have to become a member of the management company for the site. John has received no complaints from neighbours about anything.\u0027 Land Registry records confirm that Labour\u0027s Shadow Chancellor and his wife paid £135,000 in cash in December 2013 for the two bedroom leasehold property in the popular holiday village of Potter Heigham. The average salary in Norfolk is £23,295 and the average first time property buyer price is £185,587. It is believed that the chalet is now worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla. But some villagers have been left less than impressed by McDonnell\u0027s revelation this week that Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7 million private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. McDonnell said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home for a bargain price as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market price. The controversial policy would not affect second home owners like McDonnell and his wife who do not rent out their additional property.  One near neighbour of McDonnell said: \u0027When I saw the news about him banging on about punishing people for being private landlords, I thought, \u0027Hang on a minute, he\u0027s a second home owner himself.\u0027 \u0027It seems a bit hypocritical and duplicitous for him to be targeting landlords when he and his wife have their own second home.        The chalet (pictured) is now believed to be worth around £170,000 as they have carried out improvements to it and prices in the area have soared by more than 18 per cent in the last five years according to property website Zoopla         The wooden property has its own jetty and a quayside on the banks of the River Thurne as well as a smart garden with a double swinging seat, a dining table and chairs, and a pergola with climbing roses         McDonnell (pictured with his wife) sparked outrage this week when he said Labour planned to target Britain\u0027s 2.7m private landlords in its project to redistribute the nation\u0027s wealth. He said he wanted to offer private tenants the same right to buy their home as council tenants, meaning that landlords would lose out by being forced to sell for less than the market priceSome of the policies he has been reported as coming up with are very, very Marxist. \u0027At least half the bungalows on the riverbanks here are rented out as holiday homes. McDonnell could probably make £350 a week in the winter and up to £700 a week in the summer if he rented his place out – but he does not do it. \u0027He and his wife just keep it for their families. They come up here quite regularly for weekends, especially in the summer.          One neighbour in the village of Potter Heigham accused socialist politician McDonnell of hypocrisy over plans to target second home owners when he owns one himself\u0027McDonnell\u0027s son finished university last year and came up with three or four friends for a week. They created bedlam, making a lot of noise and jumping in the river. They even bashed his boat into the staithe at Potter Heigham. \u0027I know one of the neighbours called McDonnell\u0027s wife to tell her what the hell was going on at their property \u0027I have seen him relaxing in the garden in full view of all the holidaymakers going past on their boats. Nobody seems to recognise him, but the people who have homes around here all know who he is. \u0027Members of his wife\u0027s family also stay here, and I have seen a guy who looks just like McDonnell. I am guessing he is his brother.\u0027  McDonnell\u0027s chalet cannot be accessed by car and is nearly half a mile walk away from the nearest car park on his side of the river. The neighbour who asked not to be named said McDonnell paid for an annual parking permit in a car park on the opposite side of the river. He added: \u0027When he is coming up here, he calls his handyman who runs a water taxi service. The handyman then takes his boat to the other side of the river to pick him up. \u0027If he wants to go somewhere when he is staying here, he can take his boat across to the other side, moor it up, and then go off in his car. \u0027I remember seeing him early in the morning, dressed in his suit and red tie as he rowed across the river to get to his car. Then a few hours later I saw him on TV on one of the political shows. \u0027The local handyman does a really good job of looking after their place. Last year I think he replaced all the wood on their jetty, their quay heading and their decking. It would probably have cost around £2,000.\u0027 The neighbour revealed that McDonnell sold his 17ft long Skipper 17 yacht with a cockpit big enough for four crew, for around £1,000 last year. He now has another similar sized, but slightly scruffy yacht, with an outboard engine and a mast which can be lowered to get under bridges. The yacht is moored at McDonnell\u0027s own jetty, just a short distance away from a small rowing boat with its own outboard engine on his quayside. A third rowing boat was seen lying upturned on the jetty today. McDonnell and his wife bought their property with 63 years remaining on its lease.          McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth. His mother worked at British Home Stores in the town for 30 years, and his father was a branch secretary of the Transport and General Workers UnionThe freehold of the land is owned by the Environment Agency. In common with all other leaseholders in the area, they are shareholders in the Thurne Bungalow Management Company which manages their homes. Neighbours said that they had to pay a service charge of around £200 a year, entitling them to have their rubbish collected once a week by a rubbish collection boat.  McDonnell has long standing links with Norfolk, having grown up in Great Yarmouth.

Venice has already introduced Despo exclusion orders and fines in a crackdown on badly behaved tourists. Mayor Brugnaro said he was inspired to consider a smoking ban after a visit to Tokyo where there are areas people cannot smoke in (file picture)The Italian city has already started handing out \u0027Daspo\u0027 exclusion orders which fine tourists around £300 for anti-social behaviour.Since the bans were introduced on June 19 more than 100 have been issued, including one to a Canadian woman who sunbathed in a bikini. Locals have also recently succeeded in winning a decades-long struggle to ban cruise ships from docking in Venice, saying they ruin the city\u0027s skyline. The decision came after a cruise ship collided with a small tourist boat along one of Venice\u0027s canals in June.Banning outdoor smoking in Venice, which is visited by around 30 million holidaymakers a year, would help keep the streets clear of cigarette butts.The move would also help cut down on tourists and locals breathing in second hand smoke while enjoying the city. Mayor Brugnaro explained how he would start with the more \u0027delicate\u0027 historic areas of the city, such as the Rialto Bridge and St Mark\u0027s Square.  Mayor Brugnaro said: \u0027I\u0027m speaking as someone who enjoys the occasional cigar, but I always try to avoid smoking when there are lots of people around, even if I\u0027m out in the open.\u0027         Venice is considering banning smoking outdoors.

Begum\u0027s father Ahmed Ali, who lives in Sunamganu, Bangladesh, said in March his daughter\u0027s citizenship should not be cancelled and that she could be punished in the United Kingdom\u0027Such journalistic investigation is to be encouraged, however the work of investigative journalists in particular does rely upon trust, confidentiality, protection of journalistic material and sources, their perceived neutrality, and the co-operation of people who are prepared to place their trust in journalists.\u0027Judge Dennis said that as Ms Begum had spoken openly and knew her words would be published, the threat to journalistic freedom from such an order was not as great as compelling journalists to name a confidential source.But he added: \u0027Nevertheless, the purported interference remains and has a wider potential impact for journalists and cannot be simply discounted in the face of competing public interest in pursuing the police investigation.\u0027Although the Met\u0027s application was rejected, Judge Dennis ordered that copies of all the material remain with the firm of solicitors it has been placed with until further order from the court, to prevent it being lost.Judge Dennis said if Ms Begum were to return to the UK, a fresh application could be considered.Mr Loyd, who was present for the ruling, told the PA news agency: \u0027I understand the legality and legitimacy of the police investigation, but I totally resent being co-opted into that as a journalist by a police force that would not send officers itself to interview (Ms Begum).\u0027The police application had a lot of really serious implications to do with press freedom and had a potentially chilling effect.\u0027         Begum is trying to return to Britain with the help of her family lawyer Tasnime Akunjee (above)Mr Loyd, who has more than 25 years working in conflict zones, said he had never before received a request of this kind from police.But he said it was \u0027far more right and reasonable\u0027 that Ms Begum be investigated by the Met and brought back to the UK as a British citizen than to leave her stateless in a Syrian refugee camp, as is her current situation.John Battle, head of compliance at ITN, told PA: \u0027It\u0027s a victory for journalism that the judge did not make the order.\u0027Judge Dennis clearly recognised that the journalism was of the highest public interest obtained in difficult and dangerous circumstances.\u0027The judge also accepted that journalism relies on the journalist being neutral, independent and sources being respected and this is an important precedent.\u0027ITN correspondent Rohit Kachroo was among those who interviewed Ms Begum.Scotland Yard faced criticism in July when it warned journalists not to publish leaked diplomatic cables from Britain\u0027s US ambassador Sir Kim Darroch.The force said it was not seeking to block publication of articles but said it had opened a criminal investigation into a potential breach of the Official Secrets Act and that further publication could be a criminal offence.Senior politicians and editors defended the right of the Press to publish leaked documents if they were in the public interest.A Scotland Yard spokesman has been contacted for comment by MailOnline today. "},{"url":null,"title":"Woodpecker returns tree trunk stash food owl asleep inside","story":"Share this article \u0027The woodpecker got within inches of the owl but the owl never even opened its eyes as the woodpecker was peeking in.\u0027Once the woodpecker left, the owl opened its sleepy eyes and looked out for a brief moment before going back to sleep.\u0027         Ms Sepkovic, a paralegal from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, said: \u0027I was very excited when the woodpecker flew up to the tree\u0027 Red-bellied woodpeckers, which are native to the United States, are known to hide stores of nuts, fruits and seeds in cracks in trees.Ms Sepkovic, a paralegal from Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, said: \u0027I was very excited when the woodpecker flew up to the tree.\u0027I had no idea what would happen between the two species as the woodpecker was going all around the cavity and was at times very close to the owl.\u0027I was surprised the owl didn\u0027t even open its eyes during the woodpecker\u0027s inquiry, rather she just continued to snooze. "},{"url":null,"title":"Stomach churning moment huge python regurgitates 88 pound goat","story":"Share this article The snake was found on Sunday in the mountains outside the village of Longju in Anxi County, Quanzhou city, according to Quanzhou Evening News.Goatherds Mr Yao and his wife went looking for the predator after yet another one of their livestock went missing.Mr Yao told Pear Video: \u0027Our goats kept going missing since the beginning of this year.

But since Tuesday, readers have been posting images on Twitter of their freshly delivered copies, a week before the novel’s official release on 10 September. understands that despite the measures that had bookshops promising to store copies of the novel in a secured area until publication day, around 800 orders were shipped early, but only in the US.In a statement, The Testaments’ publisher Penguin Random House said the cause was “due to a retailer error which has now been rectified”.“We appreciate that readers have been waiting patiently, in some cases for more than 30 years, for the much anticipated sequel … In order to ensure our readers around the world receive their copies on the same day, our global publication date remains Tuesday 10 September,” it said.Amazon UK declined to comment on the leak, forwarding queries to their US counterparts.The breaking of the embargo means the novel’s contents are are reaching the public domain, with glowing reviews published online on Wednesday. Calling the novel a “fleet-footed sequel” in which Atwood’s “sheer assurance as a storyteller makes for a fast, immersive narrative that’s as propulsive as it is melodramatic”, the New York Times review revealed that the novel explores the “intertwined fates” of Offred, narrator of The Handmaid’s Tale, her two daughters, and the disciplinarian figure Aunt Lydia.An extract from the novel published by the  unveils further details of Atwood’s three narrators: Aunt Lydia, who tells us that “over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader”, and two young girls.One, who is adopted and lives within the dystopian state of Gilead, has “a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand”. She reveals details of her life under the regime, where girls must have “arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed”. The other lives outside Gilead and discovers on her 16th birthday that “I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose.”Atwood, who will take part in a live event screened across hundreds of cinemas around the world next Tuesday to mark The Testaments’ publication, has so far made only one public statement about the novel: “Dear Readers: Everything you’ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything! The other inspiration is the world we’ve been living in.”On Wednesday it was also announced that streaming company Hulu and MGM will be developing The Testaments for the screen. In an interview with Atwood for the new book, Time reported that Bruce Miller, showrunner for Hulu’s award-winning adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, is currently in talks over how to handle the new material in the sequel.

Already I am petrified.This statue was a small token of appreciation for my many contributions, said the citation, which was read out by Aunt Vidala. She’d been assigned the task by our superiors, and was far from appreciative. I thanked her with as much modesty as I could summon, then pulled the rope that released the cloth drape shrouding me it billowed to the ground, and there I stood. We don’t do cheering here at Ardua Hall, but there was some discreet clapping. I inclined my head in a nod.My statue is larger than life, as statues tend to be, and shows me as younger, slimmer, and in better shape than I’ve been for some time. I am standing straight, shoulders back, my lips curved into a firm but benevolent smile. My eyes are fixed on some cosmic point of reference understood to represent my idealism, my unflinching commitment to duty, my determination to move forward despite all obstacles. Not that anything in the sky would be visible to my statue, placed as it is in a morose cluster of trees and shrubs beside the footpath running in front of Ardua Hall. We Aunts must not be too presumptuous, even in stone.Clutching my left hand is a girl of seven or eight, gazing up at me with trusting eyes. My right hand rests on the head of a woman crouched at my side, her hair veiled, her eyes upturned in an expression that could be read as either craven or grateful – one of our Handmaids – and behind me is one of my Pearl Girls, ready to set out on her missionary work. Hanging from a belt around my waist is my Taser. This weapon reminds me of my failings: had I been more effective, I would not have needed such an implement. The persuasion in my voice would have been enough.As a group of statuary it’s not a great success: too crowded. I would have preferred more emphasis on myself. But at least I look sane. It could well have been otherwise, as the elderly sculptress – a true believer since deceased – had a tendency to confer bulging eyes on her subjects as a sign of their pious fervour. Her bust of Aunt Helena looks rabid, that of Aunt Vidala is hyperthyroid, and that of Aunt Elizabeth appears ready to explode.At the unveiling the sculptress was nervous. Was her rendition of me sufficiently flattering? Did I approve of it? Would I be seen to approve? I toyed with the idea of frowning as the sheet came off, but thought better of it: I am not without compassion. “Very lifelike,” I said.That was nine years ago. Since then my statue has weathered: pigeons have decorated me, moss has sprouted in my damper crevices. Votaries have taken to leaving offerings at my feet: eggs for fertility, oranges to suggest the fullness of pregnancy, croissants to reference the moon. I ignore the breadstuffs – usually they have been rained on – but pocket the oranges. Oranges are so refreshing.I write these words in my private sanctum within the library of Ardua Hall – one of the few libraries remaining after the enthusiastic book-burnings that have been going on across our land. The corrupt and blood-smeared fingerprints of the past must be wiped away to create a clean space for the morally pure generation that is surely about to arrive. Such is the theory.But among these bloody fingerprints are those made by ourselves, and these can’t be wiped away so easily. Over the years I’ve buried a lot of bones now I’m inclined to dig them up again – if only for your edification, my unknown reader. If you are reading, this manuscript at least will have survived. Though perhaps I’m fantasizing: perhaps I will never have a reader. Perhaps I’ll only be talking to the wall, in more ways than one.That’s enough inscribing for today. My hand hurts, my back aches, and my nightly cup of hot milk awaits me. I’ll stash this screed in its hiding place, avoiding the surveillance cameras – I know where they are, having placed them myself. Despite such precautions, I’m aware of the risk I’m running: writing can be dangerous. What betrayals, and then what denunciations, might lie in store for me? There are several within Ardua Hall who would love to get their hands on these pages.Wait, I counsel them silently: it will get worse.You have asked me to tell you what it was like for me when I was growing up within Gilead. You say it will be helpful, and I do wish to be helpful. I imagine you expect nothing but horrors, but the reality is that many children were loved and cherished, in Gilead as elsewhere, and many adults were kind though fallible, in Gilead as elsewhere.I hope you will remember, too, that we all have some nostalgia for whatever kindness we have known as children, however bizarre the conditions of that childhood may seem to others. I agree with you that Gilead ought to fade away – there is too much of wrong in it, too much that is false, and too much that is surely contrary to what God intended – but you must permit me some space to mourn the good that will be lost.At our school, pink was for spring and summer, plum was for fall and winter, white was for special days: Sundays and celebrations. Arms covered, hair covered, skirts down to the knee before you were five and no more than two inches above the ankle after that, because the urges of men were terrible things and those urges needed to be curbed. The man eyes that were always roaming here and there like the eyes of tigers, those searchlight eyes, needed to be shielded from the alluring and indeed blinding power of us – of our shapely or skinny or fat legs, of our graceful or knobbly or sausage arms, of our peachy or blotchy skins, of our entwining curls of shining hair or our coarse unruly pelts or our straw-like wispy braids, it did not matter. Whatever our shapes and features, we were snares and enticements despite ourselves, we were the innocent and blameless causes that through our very nature could make men drunk with lust, so that they’d stagger and lurch and topple over the verge – The verge of what? we wondered. Was it like a cliff ? – and go plunging down in flames, like snowballs made of burning sulphur hurled by the angry hand of God. We were custodians of an invaluable treasure that existed, unseen, inside us we were precious flowers that had to be kept safely inside glass houses, or else we would be ambushed and our petals would be torn off and our treasure would be stolen and we would be ripped apart and trampled by the ravenous men who might lurk around any corner, out there in the wide sharp-edged sin-ridden world.That was the kind of thing runny-nosed Aunt Vidala would tell us at school while we were doing petit-point embroidery for handkerchiefs and footstools and framed pictures: flowers in a vase, fruit in a bowl were the favoured patterns. But Aunt Estée, the teacher we liked the best, would say Aunt Vidala was overdoing it and there was no point in frightening us out of our wits, since to instil such an aversion might have a negative influence on the happiness of our future married lives.“All men are not like that, girls,” she would say soothingly. “The better kind have superior characters. Some of them have decent self-restraint. And once you are married it will seem quite different to you, and not very fearsome at all.” Not that she would know anything about it, since the Aunts were not married they were not allowed to be. That was why they could have writing and books. “We and your fathers and mothers will choose your husbands wisely for you when the time comes,” Aunt Estée would say. “So you don’t need to be afraid. Just learn your lessons and trust your elders to do what is best, and everything will unfold as it should. I will pray for it.”But despite Aunt Estée’s dimples and friendly smile, it was Aunt Vidala’s version that prevailed. It turned up in my nightmares: the shattering of the glass house, then the rending and tearing and the trampling of hooves, with pink and white and plum fragments of myself scattered over the ground. I dreaded the thought of growing older – older enough for a wedding. I had no faith in the wise choices of the Aunts: I feared that I would end up married to a goat on fire.The pink, the white, and the plum dresses were the rule for special girls like us. Ordinary girls from Econofamilies wore the same thing all the time –those ugly multicoloured stripes and grey cloaks, like the clothes of their mothers. They did not even learn petit-point embroidery or crochet work, just plain sewing and the making of paper flowers and other such chores. They were not pre-chosen to be married to the very best men – to the Sons of Jacob and the other Commanders or their sons – not like us although they might get to be chosen once they were older if they were pretty enough.Nobody said that. You were not supposed to preen yourself on your good looks, it was not modest, or take any notice of the good looks of other people. Though we girls knew the truth: that it was better to be pretty than ugly. Even the Aunts paid more attention to the pretty ones. But if you were already pre-chosen, pretty didn’t matter so much.I didn’t have a squint like Huldah or a pinchy built-in frown like Shunammite, and I didn’t have barely-there eyebrows like Becka, but I was unfinished. I had a dough face, like the cookies my favourite Martha, Zilla, made for me as a treat, with raisin eyes and pumpkin-seed teeth. But though I was not especially pretty, I was very, very chosen. Doubly chosen: not only pre-chosen to marry a Commander but chosen in the first place by Tabitha, who was my mother.That is what Tabitha used to tell me: “I went for a walk in the forest,” she would say, “and then I came to an enchanted castle, and there were a lot of little girls locked inside, and none of them had any mothers, and they were under the spell of the wicked witches. I had a magic ring that unlocked the castle, but I could only rescue one little girl. So I looked at them all very carefully, and then, out of the whole crowd, I chose you!”“What happened to the others?” I would ask. “The other little girls?”“Different mothers rescued them,” she would say.“Did they have magic rings too?”“Of course, my darling. In order to be a mother, you need to have a magic ring.”“Where’s the magic ring?” I would ask. “Where is it now?”“It’s right here on my finger,” she would say, indicating the third finger of her left hand. The heart finger, she said it was. “But my ring had only one wish in it, and I used that one up on you. So now it’s an ordinary, everyday mother ring.”At this point I was allowed to try on the ring, which was gold, with three diamonds in it: a big one, and a smaller one on either side. It did look as if it might have been magic once.“Did you lift me up and carry me?” I would ask. “Out of the forest?” I knew the story off by heart, but I liked to hear it repeated.“No, my dearest, you were already too big for that. If I had carried you I would have coughed, and then the witches would have heard us.” I could see this was true: she did cough quite a lot. “So I took you by the hand, and we crept out of the castle so the witches wouldn’t hear us. We both said Shh, shh” – here she would hold her finger up to her lips, and I would hold my finger up too and say Shh, shh delightedly – “and then we had to run very fast through the forest, to get away from the wicked witches, because one of them had seen us going out the door. We ran, and then we hid in a hollow tree. It was very dangerous!”I did have a hazy memory of running through a forest with someone holding my hand. Had I hidden in a hollow tree? It seemed to me that I had hidden somewhere. So maybe it was true.“And then what happened?” I would ask.“And then I brought you to this beautiful house. Aren’t you happy here? You are so cherished, by all of us! Aren’t we both lucky that I chose you?”I would be nestled close to her, with her arm around me and my head against her thin body, through which I could feel her bumpy ribs. My ear would be pressed to her chest, and I could hear her heart hammering away inside her – faster and faster, it seemed to me, as she waited for me to say something. I knew my answer had power: I could make her smile, or not.What could I say but yes and yes? Yes, I was happy. Yes, I was lucky. Anyway it was true.They say I will always have the scar, but I’m almost better so yes, I think I’m strong enough to do this now. You’ve said that you’d like me to tell you how I got involved in this whole story, so I’ll try though it’s hard to know where to begin.I’ll start just before my birthday, or what I used to believe was my birthday. Neil and Melanie lied to me about that: they’d done it for the best of reasons and they’d meant really well, but when I first found out about it I was very angry at them. Keeping up my anger was difficult, though, because by that time they were dead. You can be angry at dead people, but you can never have a conversation about what they did or you can only have one side of it. And I felt guilty as well as angry, because they’d been murdered, and I believed then that their murder was my fault.I was supposed to be turning sixteen. What I was most looking forward to was getting my driver’s licence. I felt too old for a birthday party, though Melanie always got me a cake and ice cream and sang “Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer true,” an old song I’d loved as a child and was now finding embarrassing. I did get the cake, later – chocolate cake, vanilla ice cream, my favourites – but by then I couldn’t eat it. By that time Melanie was no longer there.That birthday was the day I discovered that I was a fraud. Or not a fraud, like a bad magician: a fake, like a fake antique. I was a forgery, done on purpose. I was so young at that moment – just a split second ago, it seems –but I’m not young anymore. How little time it takes to change a face: carve it like wood, harden it. No more of that wide-eyed daydream gazing I used to do. I’ve become sharper, more focused. I’ve become narrowed.Neil and Melanie were my parents they ran a store called The Clothes Hound. It was basically used clothing: Melanie called it “previously loved” because she said “used” meant “exploited.” The sign outside showed a smiling pink poodle in a fluffy skirt with a pink bow on its head, carrying a shopping bag. Underneath was a slogan in italics and quotation marks: “You’d Never Know!” That meant the used clothes were so good you’d never know they were used, but that wasn’t true at all because most of the clothes were crappy.Melanie said she’d inherited The Clothes Hound from her grandmother. She also said she knew the sign was old-fashioned, but people were familiar with it and it would be disrespectful to change it now.Our store was on Queen West, in a stretch of blocks that had once all been like that, said Melanie – textiles, buttons and trims, cheap linens, dollar stores. But now it was going upmarket: cafés with fair trade and organic were moving in, big-brand outlets, name boutiques. In response, Melanie hung a sign in the window: Wearable Art. But inside, the store was crowded with all kinds of clothes you would never call wearable art. There was one corner that was kind of designer, though anything really pricey wouldn’t be in The Clothes Hound in the first place. The rest was just everything. And all sorts of people came and went: young, old, looking for bargains or finds, or just looking. Or selling: even street people would try to get a few dollars for T-shirts they’d picked up at garage sales.Melanie worked on the main floor. She wore bright colours, like orange and hot pink, because she said they created a positive and energetic atmosphere, and anyway she was part gypsy at heart. She was always brisk and smiling, though on the lookout for shoplifting. After closing, she sorted and packed: this for charity, this for rags, this for Wearable Art. While doing the sorting she’d sing tunes from musicals – old ones from long ago. “Oh what a beautiful morning” was one of her favourites, and “When you walk through a storm.” I would get irritated by her singing I’m sorry about that now.Sometimes she’d get overwhelmed: there was too much fabric, it was like the ocean, waves of cloth coming in and threatening to drown her. Cashmere! Who was going to buy thirty-year-old cashmere? It didn’t improve with age, she would say – not like her.Neil had a beard that was going grey and wasn’t always trimmed, and he didn’t have much hair. He didn’t look like a businessman, but he handled what they called “the money end”: the invoices, the accounting, the taxes. He had his office on the second floor, up a flight of rubber-treaded stairs. He had a computer and a filing cabinet and a safe, but otherwise that room wasn’t much like an office: it was just as crowded and cluttered as the store because Neil liked to collect things. Wind-up music boxes, he had a number of those. Clocks, a lot of different clocks. Old adding machines that worked with a handle. Plastic toys that walked or hopped across the floor, such as bears and frogs and sets of false teeth. A slide projector for the kind of coloured slides that nobody had anymore. Cameras – he liked ancient cameras. Some of them could take better pictures than anything nowadays, he’d say. He had one whole shelf with nothing on it but cameras.One time he left the safe open and I looked inside. Instead of the wads of money I’d been expecting, there was nothing in it but a tiny metal-and-glass thing that I thought must be another toy, like the hopping false teeth. But I couldn’t see where to wind it up, and I was afraid to touch it because it was old.“Can I play with it?” I asked Neil.“Play with what?”“That toy in the safe.”“Not today,” he said, smiling. “Maybe when you’re older.” Then he shut the safe door, and I forgot about the strange little toy until it was time for me to remember it, and to understand what it was.Neil would try to repair the various items, though often he failed because he couldn’t find the parts. Then the things would just sit there, “collecting dust,” said Melanie. Neil hated throwing anything out.On the walls he had some old posters: LOOSE LIPS SINK SHIPS, from a long-ago war a woman in overalls flexing her biceps to show that women could make bombs – that was from the same olden-days war and a red-and-black one showing a man and a flag that Neil said was from Russia before it was Russia. Those had belonged to his great-grandfather, who’d lived in Winnipeg. I knew nothing about Winnipeg except that it was cold.I loved The Clothes Hound when I was little: it was like a cave full of treasures. I wasn’t supposed to be in Neil’s office by myself because I might “touch things,” and then I might break them. But I could play with the wind-up toys and the music boxes and the adding machines, under supervision. Not the cameras though, because they were too valuable, said Neil, and anyway there was no film in them, so what would be the point?We didn’t live over the store. Our house was a long distance away, in one of those residential neighbourhoods where there were some old bungalows and also some newer, bigger houses that had been built where the bungalows had been torn down. Our house was not a bungalow – it had a second floor, where the bedrooms were – but it was not a new house either. It was made of yellow brick, and it was very ordinary. There was nothing about it that would make you look at it twice. Thinking back, I’m guessing that was their idea.• © Margaret Atwood 2019.

That’s why the BoE favours a transition period, to help companies adjust.Q: Would the impact of Brexit be worse if it happened just before or after a general election?Q: What would happen if Britain suffered a no-deal Brexit and a trade-war induced global downturn, at the same time?Asked about the global economy, Mark Carney says world growth has not reaccelerated as fast as expected.He says this is because there is now a full-blown trade war between the US and China, which is also hurting business confidence worldwide.We are close to a manufacturing recession across the advanced economies, and important parts of the emerging world, which has had a knock-on impact on trade.But he doesn’t think we face a global recession, as the fundamentals in the major economies are still quite strong.Q: Would Mark Carney possibly consider staying on longer at the Bank of England?The governor reminds the committee that he has extended his tenure twice already, to help to UK prepare for Brexit.Q: You’re due to leave on 31st January -- that could be the same day as Brexit (if another extension is agreed).Currently I’m leaving months after the Brexit day, points out Carney - reminding the committee that the existing deadline is 31 October.Q: But if there was to be a cliff-edge on 31 January, could you stay on to help?....The appointment of a new governor is a matter for the government, Carney replies.Q: Has the Brexit crisis made the governorship less appealing?MPC member Jonathan Haskell says not - it’s just part of the job.Fellow MPC member Gertjan Vlieghe says Brexit makes the role “more challenging”, but any suitable candidate should relish that...Mark Carney has also provided this chart, showing how the Bank has scaled back its forecasts for a worst-case Brexit.In the letter to the committee, Carney cites several reasons for the new, less severe forecasts, including border preparations and the UK’s new tariff plans.Q: How would the Bank of England protect the economy after a no-deal Brexit?Carney says the Bank stands ready to intervene to provide liquidity into the financial system if needed.It could cut the requirements on banks to hold capital, potentially releasing up to £300bn of balance sheet firepower.And on monetary policy, the Bank would have to decide whether to cut interest rates to stimulate growth, or raise them to tackle inflation.Mark Carney says the tariff schedule laid out by the government earlier this year show that tariffs on food from Europe would be lower than the Bank thought last November.Q: How would your forecasts change if there was a no-deal Brexit, not a smooth transition?Mark Carney says the economy would slow, the exchange rate would fall further, and inflation would rise in a no-deal scenario."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d53101ed9ec5244785b3fb06fa8a41301269b9b8/0_129_3430_2058/master/3430.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd7887b199db5186f132f3435bfe8979","title":"which is the worlds vainest city","story":"Is it a plastic surgery centre such as Seoul or Rio de Janeiro, or a hotbed of selfie-takers such as Manhattan?With his penchant for posting topless photos of himself to his 181 million Instagram followers, Cristiano Ronaldo is pretty notorious for his vanity. (“Yes bro! Your body is ripped,” wrote one fan on a photo of the footballer meditating in the bath). “You used to see Ronaldo standing in front of the mirror loving himself,” said the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in an interview a couple of years ago. “But it was a nice vanity.”It is easy to find iniduals who are preoccupied with their looks, but hard to define exactly what makes a person vain. Factors such as economics, culture and age all influence how much we care about our appearance. Is there evidence that people in certain cities are more image-conscious than others?Looking at data for cosmetic surgery around the world is one place to start. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) publishes data annually on the estimated number of plastic surgeons practising in each country, and the popularity of different procedures. Bearing that in mind, the top five countries for the number of total listed procedures in 2017 were the US, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Italy (the data for 2018 is still being compiled). So that could be an indication that the major cities in those countries are places where looks really matter.However, South Korea is thought to have the highest density of plastic surgeons in the world: 2,330 for a population of 51 million. Compare this to the US, which has roughly triple the surgeons in the ISAPS survey (6,800) but also has a population six times larger (327 million).Seoul’s swanky Gangnam District is the centre of this perfection-driven culture, with a reported 400-500 cosmetic surgery clinics in one square mile. The most common procedure is blepharoplasty, or “double eyelid” surgery, which creates an additional fold in the eyelids and makes eyes appear larger. Nose and jaw surgery is also popular.It wouldn’t necessarily be fair to attribute this to vanity, however, says the Seoul-based YouTuber Alfred “Haeppy” Lueng, who documents Seoul culture in his vlog. “South Korea is a very competitive society and many opportunities depend on looks,” he says. “It is required here to send a photograph with your CV, for example, whereas in other places that would be illegal.”Choi Min, a surgeon at Answer Plastic Surgery in Seoul who specialises in facial surgery, says: “If we lived in a world where looks weren’t important we would see very different movie stars and K-pop idols. For now, we live in this world and plastic surgery can even out the playing field.”Seoul’s ambitious young people see no reason not to have plastic surgery, says Leung: “There’s no shame attached to it and people are only making small changes – natural-looking beauty is still valued.” He adds that it is a misconception that Koreans are influenced by western beauty standards and are “trying to look more white” through face surgery. Rather, economic pressure and historical Korean beauty ideals around eyes and jawline drive the appeal, research shows.In Brazil, cosmetic surgery is similarly considered normal rather than a vanity project, and is common among all strata of society, says the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, author of The Biopolitics of Beauty. The government subsidises almost half a million plastic surgeries a year through public hospitals, according to Jarrin’s research, covering both reconstructive and purely aesthetic procedures.It is an urban phenomenon, Jarrin says. While Rio de Janeiro might be considered a prime spot for beach body-related anxiety, a density of clinics can be found in São Paulo too, as well as smaller cities such as Recife, Porto Alegre and Santos that are gaining traction as places for tourists in search of cosmetic surgery to visit.Jarrin says the availability of low-cost or free cosmetic procedures mean that people who can’t afford to go private can have done it poorly by junior doctors or have new techniques practised on them, leading to potentially serious mistakes. People take such risks because they are considered worth it – beauty can be a means to combat hardships.“The conclusion I have come to is that beauty condenses all the race, class and gender inequalities in Brazil – and it is a very, very unequal country,” Jarrin says. “People see inequality reinforced by beauty and constantly talk about having the right appearance to get a job, or marry up.”In the US, Los Angeles has long had a reputation as a city where looking beautiful and stylish carries the promise of really getting somewhere. However, Men’s Health magazine’s 2012 assessment of America’s vainest cities ranked another California city, San Francisco, much higher than LA, based on sales of products such as at-home teeth whitening kits and hair dye. Tampa, Florida, came top of that list, with LA a lowly 60th.Similarly, health clubs grew by 20 million members globally between 2017 and 2018, and the “wellness” industry is now a $4.2tn market. In the UK, a 2017 survey by a wellness brand found that Liverpool, Manchester and London were the top three “fittest cities” based on gym-going frequency. Meanwhile a US athletics brand found that the Bay Area in California, comprising San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland, was the most active metropolitan area in the US based on the number of available fitness options. The lengths people will go to preserve or alter their looks and figures are not the only indicator of vanity. The instinct to take photos of ourselves and put them on social media has caused much debate about narcissism in 21st-century culture. In 2014, Time magazine ranked the “selfiest cities in the world” by analysing over 400,000 Instagram posts with both a “selfie” tag and their locations tagged.Makati City and Pasig, part of the Manila metro area in the Philippines, topped the chart with 258 selfie-takers per 100,000 people. Manhattan was second with 202 tagged selfies while Tel Aviv, Manchester and Milan were also in the top 10. “While the metric of people who take selfies per capita is far from a perfect measure, it was far and away the most comprehensive means of comparing” the 459 world cities in the study, the author wrote. The metric could also indicate levels of tourism and the density of nightlife hotspots, however.Ultimately, it seems clear that vanity and the pursuit of beauty is universal. After all, according to the late Ivo Pitanguy, Brazil’s most renowned surgeon, looking good is something everyone is entitled to. As he once remarked, “the poor have the right to be beautiful too”.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4afbf906bfb0876084f9b0e6cae4c21e9846316/0_375_5632_3380/master/5632.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ac2d15d46d88acb9b611a33302b239e","title":"left sunderland precarious invincibility working class people history","story":"I had a sick feeling that the stories of the working-class people I loved were slipping away so I set out to capture themI often wonder whether in order to see the whole shape of a place you must leave and feel the contours of its edges. To leave means you can return, but not as the same person. I grew up in Sunderland and left at 18, desperate to shed my skin and become someone different. At 24 I sat down to write my first novel and the raucous bars and rusty bridges of my hometown rushed out of me with a bright, hot urgency. Working-class lives are not often recorded in literary novels, so I wrote them down to remember. I had a seasick feeling that the stories of the people I loved were slipping away. I wrote them down to prove to myself I had a history.I wrote about Sunday afternoons at Seaburn Beach in the 90s, where I pushed hot coppers through silver slots at the amusement arcades and zipped up my Puffa jacket tightly. I put too much salt and vinegar on my chips and ate them looking at the sea. The waves crashed against Roker Pier like fireworks, spilling over the sides and flooding the footpath. My dad and I squinted into the spray and saw small figures running towards the lighthouse.“Wave dodgers.” My dad shook his head. He explained that teenagers played a game where they stood on the edge of the pier and tried to run to safety just before the waves hit. “It’s completely crackers,” he said. “Those waves are strong. Sometimes the kids get pulled under and their bodies wash up later on the beach.” We watched the water swell and churn. I felt the pull of it in my stomach.“Why do they do it, then?” I asked him.“Got nothing better to do, I suppose.”It was a delicate balance to portray the invincibility and precarity of Sunderland simultaneously. The people I know are inconceivably strong and capable, but their lives are not deemed worthy of investment by those in power, which makes them vulnerable, too.I wrote about Saturday nights down Holmeside in the late 2000s. My best friend and I toasted Ribena-coloured glasses of rosé wine, backcombed our hair with toothbrushes and threw peeling leather jackets over bodycon dresses. We linked arms through clouds of Silvikrin and scraped our heels across the pavement to Independent, our local indie club. Vodka shots cost 50p and we spun through smoke together. We danced all night to Foals and the Klaxons, holding hands in the smoking area as boys in eyeliner and red Libertines jackets asked us for a light. We grazed our knees on the sticky dance floor and lost our keys and phones without caring. We didn’t hold much power in the world and we knew it, but those dark, wild hours belonged to us.The protagonist of my novel moves to London for university. She feels inadequate because she doesn’t have the right words or books or clothes with which to move through the capital. When she returns home to visit Sunderland, she feels the sudden bruise of what she gave away.“I couldn’t compete with other people at university in terms of money or knowledge or intelligent witticisms,” she realises, “but the music and the dancing were absolutely mine.”After I moved away, I went back to visit and walked through Jacky Whites Market. I moved towards the fish stall where my gran used to work. It shone iridescent with memory. I watched the stranger behind the counter, her pink hands chopping and slicing and I looked at my own long fingers. My mam always says they remind her of my gran and I wondered whether I could really lay claim to that to the bleach-stung skin and knife-nicked cuticles of a woman who died before I was old enough to ask questions.When my novel was published, I signed copies of it at Sunderland Waterstones. I sat behind a stack of books, wondering if I really had a right to write about the city. After all, I had left it in search of something else and returned as a different person. I had allowed my accent to soften like wax. Perhaps it was all a mythical origin story, invented because I wanted to belong. But then people began to arrive. My great-auntie came first with her bleach-blonde hair, beaming with book in hand. My nan and grandad, in coats and jumpers, fussing over cups of tea. My primary schoolteachers. My cousins. My Auntie Marie and Uncle Jim.“I can’t believe it,” said Uncle Jim, wiping his eyes. “You’ve got it all spot on, love. That’s really how it was.” Suddenly we were a family and all of it was real. My life has taken a different shape, but our shared history is stacked tall inside of me. I still love going out dancing. I still feel the pull of the sea. We are from here, our stories matter, this one is mine and it belongs to me.• Saltwater, the debut novel by Jessica Andrews, is out now, published by Sceptre in hardback, audiobook and eBook"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e69c1e4de5826eea3783e4748c22a58e926adc0/0_199_5963_3578/master/5963.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=069b15934736002747ec7a43fd6394fa","title":"to my period emma barnett","story":"I am standing in a draughty, picturesque church on an icy Saturday in December, wearing four-inch gold glittery heels and silently cursing you as you churn up my insides without a thought for the occasion. Try as I might to focus on my friend, the gleamingly beautiful bride, and stand stoic during the hymns she’s painstakingly chosen for us to chorus, all I can think is: will you please fuck off? And when can I rip off this fascinator, my heels, dress, tights and, while I’m at it, my skin? The need for delicious wedding champagne to dull your grip is getting increasingly urgent.Yeah, I’m talking to you. My pushy, aggressive, attention-seeking period. The very same period that has no sense of timing or mercy. OK fine, due to the wonder of the pill you do arrive on time, mostly. But you pay no heed to how you transform me from a fast-walking, talking vibrant being into a husk who craves warmth, trousers that have lost their elastic, and copious amounts of fat chippy chips doused in vinegar.I thought it high time I addressed you directly, seeing as we’ve known each other intimately for 24 years, which, bar my parents and three long-suffering schoolmates from Manchester, makes you my longest relationship. And yet the dialogue has been mainly one way. You communicating with me loud and proud, while I submit.I feel you coming, long before you officially arrive. And yes, I’ve got a period disease, endometriosis, which makes you more brutal to me than most women’s menstrual partners. But even when I’ve got you under some form of control via the pill and a heady cocktail of painkillers, you are still a law unto yourself, and therefore me.You make me feel hot and cold. Blue and bluer. I feel your downward pull so strong it makes my legs go weak and gives gravity a run for its money. You wreak havoc with my bowels, skin, mood and energy levels. The expulsion of all is real, month in, month out.In a way, if you weren’t so bloody and painful, you would be my kinda force: loud, dramatic, uncompromising, definite and game-changing. If you weren’t so busy making me feel like a crock of useless shit, I’d go drinking with you. Except you’d be like that mate who always takes it a step too far. The one you have to keep your eye on. That pal who sinks more booze than they can handle, requires your unided attention and sours the mood at even the happiest of gatherings.But you must be having a right old laugh at humankind. There you are with your comrades, every month, bold as brass, unapologetically coming to do your disruptive thing to me and my sisters and we don’t breathe a word. You are loud and we are cowed.Do I tell a soul at my girlfriend’s wedding why I’ve got a face etched in pain, am mainlining booze almost as fast as I’m hoovering up canapés – and why I’m hobbling in my heels long before the band starts? Do I hell.You demand my attention and refuse to be ignored. Women everywhere could learn a lot from your boldness. But a deeply embedded social code has developed around you which commands women’s silence and shame. I can’t call ours a love-hate relationship. I can’t forgive how you rob me of me each month. What I can stretch to is “respect-hate”.The three highlights of our union? Our first meeting and my sheer relief that you showed up and made me feel like a “normal” teenage girl – whatever that is. A bit like Margaret in Judy Blume’s seminal Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret, I silently and naively thanked you for putting in an appearance in that nippy loo in Manchester’s House of Fraser. Our second peak revolved around school sport. I must salute you for all the times you got me out of dreaded swimming lessons – whether you were there or not.But our best moment? When you finally buggered off post-IVF. That’s when I truly respected you for the first time and understood your purpose: our son. For without you, or at least some semblance of you, I wouldn’t have him. At that point you at last made sense to me and my gratitude was enormous. Somehow, in our bloody war, we had done something. Together.I will still have to work hard to tame you and not let you wear the trousers. I will continue to loathe the equipment you force me to shove into my pants to cope with your presence. I will still damn each day you arrive and the impact you have. And I know I will zealously celebrate the day you swagger off for good – despite the associated emotions of getting older clamouring for my attention.But we’ve been through a lot. A heck of a lot. And we could have at least another decade or two together.

Now he’s playing a manchild in a warring couples comedy by Nick Hornby. The IT Crowd favourite talks delta males – and ‘depraved’ British rulers‘There are very few alpha males,” whispers Chris O’Dowd, “but plenty of delta males. They’re not very masculine, they’re slightly ageing and they have lots of feelings of inadequacy. Delta males – it’s a term that’s very relevant to a lot of people in my life.”In State of the Union, the 39-year-old star of The IT Crowd and Bridesmaids plays just such a character. Tom is a London-based Irish music critic made redundant by the rise of social media. His last active engagement with the world was to get British citizenship in order to vote for Brexit and thereby annoy his wife’s -reading remoaner friends.His wife Louise, played by Rosamund Pike, has his number. “You were out long before Brexit,” she says. “Friends – out. Marriage – out. Life – out.” He’s withdrawn from everything, but saddest of all from sex, crashing out with no deal into unsplendid isolation.About to air on BBC Two, this unexpectedly funny, sweet and touching Emmy-nominated series, written by Nick Hornby and directed by Stephen Frears, takes place over 10 weeks, each 10-minute episode unfolding in a pub in Hammersmith, London, as the pair steel themselves for weekly couple-counselling. They’ve started therapy because Louise had a brief, regretted affair. “In an ideal world,” she tells Tom. “I’d only want to have sex with you.” But this isn’t an ideal world. At night, instead of making love, he scorns her choice of bedtime reading: “How many Scandinavian women are there left to kill?”Tom is a man in arrested development, a theme Hornby has been writing about for decades in books that became films: the obsessed Arsenal fan of Fever Pitch, played by Colin Firth the list-making record-shop geek of High Fidelity, played by John Cusack the kidult of About a Boy, played by Hugh Grant.But most of all, Tom is a reworking of the role O’Dowd played last year in the film Juliet, Naked. His Duncan was professor of television studies who microanalysed The Wire for a living and was besotted with the lame oeuvre of a 90s indie rock star played by Ethan Hawke. No wonder his long-term girlfriend, portrayed by Rose Byrne, was so bored with their relationship.While O’Dowd was funny, some felt the character he played was cartoonish and his predicament too fanciful to be believed. State of the Union is much more nuanced. Tom’s no cipher and Louise is as culpable as him for their problems. You probably know a couple like them. You may even be them.“I mean, she’s Rosamund Pike, so she could clearly do better,” says O’Dowd self-deprecatingly, speaking by phone from California. “But could she be bothered?” Actually, what’s more likely is that Louise wants to rebuild a connection with the man with she loved and whose conversation she enjoys: their dialogue sparkles throughout, even as it expresses all their pain and resentment. “I think that’s right. These guys are better together.”Who will watch State of the Union? “Anybody who’s ever been in a relationship,” says O’Dowd, who was born in County Roscommon, Ireland, but has lived in LA for 10 years. “The interesting thing about it being short-form comedy is that one of the biggest audiences will be commuters. It’s just the thing to watch on your phone for 10 minutes.”If Hornby’s males are often boys trapped in men’s bodies, his women are rarely so confined. Byrne played a museum curator, Pike is an NHS gerontologist (someone who studies ageing). In Hornbyland, women do grownup jobs while the men remain disappointing scions of the patriarchy, piggybacking on their spouses emotionally and, in State of the Union, financially.O’Dowd believes that women aren’t the only losers in a patriarchal society. “I feel a lot of men haven’t benefited either. I know that men have coasted too long in power – but come on! Having to be aggressive? Despising showing your feelings? All that’s hopeless.” Men will benefit from the #MeToo movement, he says. “To be elevated above our protective side is going to be really good for men. Equality is going to be great for everybody.”Charm itself, O’Dowd only gets cross once in our interview. With many Britons trying find enough Irish ancestry to qualify for a passport with a harp on it, Tom may well be the only Irish person who opted to become British to back Brexit. Is he like Tom in that respect? The line goes rather quiet.“It seems oddly fitting to the people of Ireland,” he says finally, “that Brexit is coming down to the backstop. The suggestion that the British government is making – that they won’t fuck us over – is laughable. That’s what they have done for 800 years. People growing up in Britain won’t have much sense of that. Their history books don’t really dwell on the depraved way Britain has treated its closest neighbour. What do I think will happen? Irish prosperity and peace are going to be completely usurped by Westminster. Again.”Otherwise O’Dowd is very much like Tom, a delta male struggling towards middle age. “I’m turning 40 very soon. I was thinking the other day, ‘I’ll be middle-aged!’ And then I thought, ‘I’ve felt middle-aged for a while.’” This year, he says, has been all about taking stock of his life: “What do I want to do with the rest of it?”He loved playing sad-eyed basement geek Roy in The IT Crowd with his catchphrase: “Have you tried turning it off and on again?” And he got a Hollywood break as the sweet cop who puts out for troubled Kristen Wiig in 2011’s Bridesmaids. He now has a regular turn in the TV adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s Get Shorty as a mob muscle aspiring to become a movie producer. We will next see him alongside Melissa McCarthy in The Starling, the two playing a couple who have lost a child in what is billed as comedy drama.While he has thrived in LA, O’Dowd is prone to misgivings. “It’s easy just to follow the work and not think too hard about where you’re going.” He never had huge expectations of his career, but is keen to have “a bit more creative control and more time at home”. He hopes to write again following the success of his book Moone Boy: The Blunder Years, a spin-off from the Sky series of the same name, based on his childhood and filmed in his home town of Boyle.When O’Dowd married the TV presenter and writer Dawn Porter in 2012, she changed her surname to O’Porter. They have two sons, Art and Valentine. He recently tweeted something that Tom could do with taking on board: “Marriage can be tricky and parenting is no walk in the park. What makes both easier is doing them with the best person you know. Happy anniversary my love.” O’Dowd is the youngest of five siblings. His dad Sean is a sign designer, his mum Denise a psychotherapist. What did she make of State of the Union? “She really enjoyed it – she saw a lot of very familiar troubles dramatised in it.” Not least the fact that it’s generally the man who is most sceptical about therapy. Upset that their shrink is a woman, Tom says to his wife: “Why do we have to do all our dirty washing in her launderette?” The shrink’s gender will, he says, make one thing inevitable: “I’m going to get slaughtered.” Why? “Because of feminism.”By the end of season one, Tom and Louise may have worked out some of their problems but I suspect there’s still more than enough material for a second season. “Maybe,” says O’Dowd. “They both need to be stripped of their illusions if they’re going to have a future together. She wants their marriage to be constant rapture. Maybe this idea that marriage is nothing but a joyous experience is nonsensical. I certainly think it is.

Others that it has the vague aroma of talcum powder mixed with vanilla. Or perhaps a freshly painted room.Members of the public will be able to decide for themselves when they rub a scented sculpture designed to evoke the smell of human breast milk. The bronze artwork, which goes on display on Thursday, is a celebration of bifidobacteria and part of a new permanent gallery at the Wellcome Collection in London exploring what it means to be human in the 21st century.Curator Clare Barlow said the gallery was a celebration of the fact “we are all different, but also all connected. We all have an impact, both on each other and on the world around us. Each of the objects raises questions and brings in different perspectives.”She hopes the 50 artworks and objects will encourage visitors “to think more deeply about things, to be surprised by things. We want people to encounter extraordinary research and ideas and art”.There are a number of interactive artworks, including the breast milk bronze by Tasha Marks of AVM Curiosities. She has titled it 5318008 any bored teenager with a calculator will tell you what that spells upside down.Elsewhere is an interactive panel called Resurrecting the Sublime, which, when rubbed, produces a floral, herby smell. It is in fact the lost scent of the extinct flower hibiscadelphus wilderianus, which grew on Mount Haleakalā in Hawaii before its habitat was destroyed by colonial cattle ranching.Music on a jukebox controlled by the public plays songs that relate to epidemics, such as The Streets’ He’s Behind You, He’s Got Swine Flu Tan Tan B and Quincy B’s ebola awareness-raising State of Emergency and LaTour’s HIV-related People Are Still Having Sex.The new gallery, designed by the Turner prize-winning collective Assemble, is ided into four sections – genetics, minds and bodies, infection and environmental breakdown.It contains a number of artworks commissioned by the Wellcome Collection, including Refugee Astronaut by Yinka Shonibare, a life-size sculpture of a galactic explorer carrying a ramshackle collection of earthly possessions.“It is an extraordinary commentary on where we are and where we might be in the future,” said BarlowThese are counterbalanced by less delightful works. Top of the list must be a display that includes eye wash, VapoRub, KY Jelly, a blender and a sieve, which the gallery says “is everything needed for a faecal transplant: where poo from a healthy person is swallowed or inserted into the gut to increase the variety of bacteria”.Barlow said: “It is not something we recommend but at the same time it is a cultural phenomenon. One that says something about the symbiotic relationship we have with our gut bacteria.”• The Being Human gallery at the Wellcome Collection, London, opens to the public on Thursday 5 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5408cd0b3ca8b88ff00d3de7f4a018f2bb969acb/0_36_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82a79484ada0c2aa6065d9479bf217d5","title":"richard ayoade webchat","story":"The director, actor, author, presenter and overachiever is joining us for a webchat on 5 September at 12pm BSTIs there another actor who could deliver the line, “I came here to drink milk and kick ass, and I’ve just finished my milk” with as much deadpan aplomb as Richard Ayoade?Before he became a flipping household name as the painfully geeky Maurice Moss in The IT Crowd, the world has owed the actor, writer, director and flaneur a great debt.

They were the “disappeared” ones who in the mid-70s began to be removed from their homes for leftism or trade unionism – spirited away without a trial, without a trace. This subtly disturbing, queasily tense satirical nightmare from 33-year-old Argentinian film-maker Benjamín Naishtat answers that question with a story of group neurosis and complicit wretchedness. He shows that, for those left behind, what also gradually disappeared was their peace of mind, their self-respect and their ability to communicate what was happening or how they felt: an uncanny, insidious erosion of self.A whole nation relapsed into silence, punctuated by outbursts of anger, out of shame that they hadn’t spoken up and fear that the same thing could happen to them, too. The elephant that had once been in the room had now vanished, and nobody wanted to say a thing about it. (That is, until the courageous Mothers of the Plaza De Mayo protest movement, composed of mothers demanding to know what had happened to their children.)Here is a world in which the owners of an elegant villa have “left the country”, leaving their property to be looted by the polite neighbours, where a local businessman’s rebellious brother-in-law, nicknamed “the hippie”, dematerialises, where a teenager vanishes on his way home from a party, and where a cheesy nightclub conjurer has a magic box that makes audience volunteers disappear.Rojo, or Red, is set in 1975, just before the coup d’etat that installed Argentina’s military junta. In this nation, with its romantic fondness for macho rodeo displays, some blandly besuited politicians are shown welcoming a visiting delegation of cowboys from the US, giving press conferences about this gesture of friendship, and then frowning at impertinent questions about the government’s destruction of civil liberties. (The US connection may be a subtle nod to Henry Kissinger’s covert enthusiasm for the junta.)The action is focused on a small town, where smug lawyer Claudio (played by Dario Grandinetti) is at a restaurant waiting for his wife Susana (Andrea Frigerio) to join him. Seated all alone and accepting cordial and respectful waves from dignitaries present at other tables, he gets into an argument with a lone stranger who resents being made to stand and wait for a table: an argument with a terrible outcome, the thought of which Claudio will spend the rest of the movie suppressing. He gets involved in a crooked scam with a businessman friend to fabricate bogus ownership documentation relating to that abandoned villa, so that it can be sold on by them at a profit. Claudio and his iffy pal go for a brazen exploratory wander around the house, with its eerie emptiness and bloodstains on the wall – an image of their own psychological mansions, and of Argentina itself. Eventually, guilty Claudio must confront a detective, played by the Chilean actor Alfredo Castro, who is to bring a biblical zeal to his work.Claudio is at a nexus of all sorts of tense, uncomfortable and bizarre situations, which the movie anthologises. Grandinetti, with his talent for sleek middle-aged conceit, will be familiar from another recent Argentinian film, Damian Szifrón’s portmanteau comedy Wild Tales (2014), in which he played one of the obnoxious people aboard a doomed flight. That was a contemporary-set film that showed the prevailing mood in Argentina was bronca, or rage, and that’s the mood here, too: the rage simmers, bubbles, sometimes subsiding and sometimes erupting. Claudio is a keen tennis player and there is a bizarre locker-room moment when he is getting changed and another guy, thoughtfully cleaning his rifle, asks Claudio what he thinks of the political situation. Of course, Naishtat is fully aware of Chekhov’s rule about what happens to a gun which is introduced in act one.Rojo is also in some sense about the return of the repressed: denial as a way of life. In this way it also resembles Lucretia Martel’s The Headless Woman (2008), a film in which a guilty act shimmers at the very edge of our field of vision, a crime that has been vigorously but only semi-consciously erased, like fingerprints on a car window. Intriguingly, the colour palette of Rojo is of a world that has been scorched and bleached like a photograph left out in the sun, a memory that has been degraded. It’s a disquieting parable of iniquity. • Rojo is released in the UK on 6 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/160571daf0c584ae1a2e8f406f254f28fab55630/1214_206_3204_1923/master/3204.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acadce3760a4fbe229e1842b4632e66e","title":"the shiny shrimps review gay mens water polo cedric le gallo","story":"A homophobic swimming champ is tasked with coaching a gay men’s team in this well-meaning but uninspiring taleAre feelgood swimming comedies about men in pools wearing silly Speedos becoming a thing? Last year from France we had Le Grand Bain, or Sink or Swim, about a depressed middle-aged man joining a male synchronised swimming team, and in Britain we had Swimming With Men on the same theme. (Both were evidently inspired by the same quirky 2010 documentary about a real-life men’s team in Sweden.)Now French film-maker Cédric le Gallo has co-created a movie inspired by his experiences with a gay men’s water polo team called Les Crevettes Pailletées (the Shiny Shrimps) and turned this into a boisterously stereotypical and puppyishly over-eager-to-please film about a homophobic swim champion called Matthias (Nicolas Gob) who causes media outcry with a bigoted remark and then must redeem himself by coaching the fictionalised Shiny Shrimps as they battle for a place at the Gay Olympics in Croatia. There are no prizes for guessing if his grumpy prejudices are finally dissolved by the Shiny Shrimps’ irresistibly life-affirming exuberance.It’s a well-meaning film, but the humour doesn’t travel particularly well, and, even given that it’s intended to be not much more than a comedy, I have to say that all the Shiny Shrimps really are fantastically infantile except for one morose oldster, a veteran of the Act Up movement of yore, who objects to a trans woman being allowed to join the team. (Another sort of film might have given us a story about this character wanting to join a cisgender woman’s water polo team.)One of the players is married with two little kids, named Gaspard and Noé – a gag for the arthouse fans, there.

Lemon juice or vinegar for the marinade? Here’s the definitive way to make this Greek version of kebabSouvlaki’s name derives from the medieval Greek for skewer, but grilling meat on sticks was a practice taken from the Muslim cooks of the near east. As the Oxford Companion to Food notes, these days they’re often made of “un-Islamic pork”. Often, but not always, you will find chicken and lamb versions (indeed, in Australia, where post-pub souvas are an institution, lamb is apparently the default).But the consensus on Twitter seems to be that pork is the classic iteration in souvlaki’s homeland, albeit consumed in very different ways depending on where you are – wrapped in bread or on a plate on its own or with chips, salad, onions, pickles, herbs, and a whole array of sauces or simply eaten straight from a pointy piece of wood by the side of the road. But what’s the best way to make it at home?Harley cuts the meat into very small pieces for her mini kebabs, but if you keep them a little larger, they’ll stay juicier during cooking.Buxton’s recipe, as used at the Real Greek chain, is quite a different beast: the sticky, aromatic marinade of orange juice, honey, mustard, paprika, cinnamon and fennel seeds reminds us (not unhappily) of Chinese roast pork rather than souvlaki. This comparison is encouraged by the fact it’s cooked in the oven, rather than on a grill, and so lacks the char that, my testers say, is vital for transportation-back-to-Greece purposes.Memories of Greek holidays also prompt my decision to go for dried oregano, rather than Hayden’s fresh herbs, delicious though they are. My guinea pigs, one of whom follows a largely vegetarian diet, rate them as more interesting, but say the oregano is the thing that sings to them of Greece. We all love the garlic though, so I’m going to keep that, and use lemon juice rather than vinegar as you can squeeze the other half over the salad.Some recipes, including Kiros’, brush the marinade on the meat just before cooking, but you’ll get more flavour if you leave them to mingle for a little longer – I wouldn’t recommend more than three or four hours though, lest the acid in the lemon juice begins to toughen the meat.Hayden gives two serving suggestions for her souvlaki: “The more traditional Greek way, with round fluffy pitta breads, chips and mustard sauce” and “the Cypriot way: in oval pitta breads, with shredded cabbage and griddled olives”.Intrigued by the mayonnaise-based mustard sauce, and tempted by the chips, I opt for the former, but her creamy tzatziki is so very good that most testers opt for that instead. “I’d have to alternate,” the lapsing vegetarian says through a mouthful of meat, “I can’t taste them both together.”Petretzikis is the only one to add vegetables to the skewers themselves, in the form of red onions and peppers. They are a good combination with the charred pork – “like a home barbecue from the 80s!” Martha says joyfully – but are very much an optional extra. It’s easier, I think, to serve the skewers with a tomato salad, perhaps with some thinly sliced red onion and chopped parsley, as most recipes recommend. (Like Kiros, I prefer to soak my onions for a milder flavour, but if you’re less of a wimp, feel free to ignore this step.)Chips are, of course, always a possibility, but bread is a must. Oval Arabic pitta are the most widely available here, but if you’re lucky enough to have access to a shop selling fluffier, round flatbreads (I got mine from a Turkish greengrocers), they’re much easier to roll up around the meat, and better at soaking up the juices too. Or, if you’re more of a sourdough sort, Harley suggests using slices of “country bread” as a plate.I’ll leave the last word on souvlaki to Hayden, a woman practically weaned on them: “Be sure to finish with a sprinkle of paprika”.For the skewers600g pork tenderloin200g pork shoulder2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed100ml olive oilJuice of ½ lemon1 tbsp dried oregano ½ tsp fine saltTo serve½ red onion, peeled4 large tomatoesJuice of ½ lemon1 small bunch flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped4 flatbreads200g tzatziki1 pinch paprikaCut the tenderloin and shoulder into cubes of roughly 2x3cm. Whisk together the crushed garlic, oil, lemon juice, oregano and salt in a container large enough to hold all the meat, then add the cubes and turn until well coated.Cover and leave to sit in a cool place for between one and four hours.Soak four wooden skewers in water, if using.About half an hour before you want to eat, slice the onion very thinly. For a milder flavour, put in a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for 20 minutes.Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes and arrange on a plate. Season and sprinkle with lemon juice, then scatter with the drained onion and the parsley.Prepare a barbecue, or heat a griddle pan until smoking hot. Thread the meat on to the skewers, pushing it together so you can’t see any skewer between the pieces. Griddle on all sides until well browned and cooked through. Meanwhile, warm the flatbreads in another hot pan or a low oven.Sprinkle the skewers with paprika and serve with salad, tzatziki and bread.

Representatives from anti-homophobia groups were due to meet delegates from the national association of supporters at the league’s headquarters in Paris’ 16th arrondissement. So confirmation the talks had been postponed at the request of the fans’ groups prompted grumbling frustration.The first few weeks of the domestic campaign have been plagued by what, at first glance, would appear to be a troubling escalation in homophobic incidents in stadiums. A little under a month into the season there have been at least 20 reports of homophobic chanting or slogans documented at games in the top two isions and League Cup. The first half of the Ligue 1 match between Nice and Marseille last week was halted for 10 minutes after home supporters at the Allianz Riviera unfurled two banners bearing homophobic messages, with a third displayed later in the match. Fans also aimed anti-gay chants at the LFP.The incidents drew condemnation as “unacceptable” from the respective managers, Patrick Vieira and André Villas-Boas, as well as from the France coach, Didier Deschamps. There had been similar scenes at Nîmes the previous weekend, and there would be again two days after events on the Côte d’Azur, with Metz’s game against Paris Saint-Germain halted for a few minutes midway through the opening period. “PSG, LFP, let me sing to you, to tell you to go fuck yourselves!” read one of the banners at Stade Saint-Symphorien. “I won’t be on TV, because my words are not very gay.”Outside the elite, a Ligue 2 meeting between Nancy and Le Mans had previously been subjected to a temporary suspension after some in the home end engaged in homophobic chants. The referee, Mehdi Mokhtari, was praised by France’s secretary of state for equality, Marlène Schiappa, for calling the players off, with the Piantoni stand at Nancy’s Stade Marcel Picot shut for a fixture as punishment.The proactive response to the chants by referees, and resultant sanctions by the game’s governing body, are in accordance with measures introduced by the LFP over the summer aimed at eradicating homophobia. Chants had previously been tolerated. Words such as enculé, with homophobic connotations, have been flung as insults from the terraces with no repercussions despite calls from LGBT groups for a clampdown. But, after the sports minister, Roxana Maracineanu, exclaimed shock at the abuse she witnessed being exchanged between Marseille and PSG supporters at their highly-charged fixture in March, the authorities finally mobilised.Maracineanu, a silver medallist in the 200m backstroke at the 2000 Olympics, claimed she would be reluctant to take her children to games, and met Noël Le Graët, president of the French Football Federation, after another incident of homophobic chanting in the derby between Lens and Valenciennes in April. An action plan, paving the way for judicial sanctions against abusive fans, was announced in May. In cooperation with the International League against Racism and antisemitism, and a group fighting violence and discrimination against LGBT people, the LFP would distribute forms at games allowing spectators to report anonymously any sexist, homophobic or racist incidents.Those found guilty of discrimination in public places, such as stadiums, face fines up to £20,000 and even prison sentences. Officials were also given the power to abandon or suspend games – a move encouraged by Emmanuel Macron, France’s president and in compliance with Fifa’s directive adopted across all member federations in July – with clubs threatened with fines and partial stadium closures. Point deductions have also been mooted. The LFP president, Nathalie Boy de la Tour, also announced awareness-raising workshops for clubs, had thousands of leaflets distributed to coaches and players at academies, some apparently unaware of the true meaning of the insults that have become the norm, and spoke of instigating proper dialogue between the authorities and fan groups.Yet, while the good intentions behind the initiatives have rightly drawn praise, a lack of proper communication with the rank and file support has undermined progress. The issue has become political. This requires context: in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks, away supporters have endured restrictions of movement in France with the authorities citing security concerns. Ultras groups have been similarly infuriated by the recent crackdown on the use of flares and smoke bombs on the terraces. Now comes action against their chants.Although plenty of match-going fans will be relieved to hear the offensive chants choked, some supporter groups, who claim to have been unaware of the new measures and the possible sanctions despite Boy de la Tour’s pledge to instigate proper dialogue, perceive this as part of a larger-scale attack on their culture and a desire from the authorities to remove them.It has been claimed the sudden increase in provocative anti-LFP songs and slogans at games is reflective of a desire to challenge not the fight against homophobia but the authorities’ wider attitude towards the fanbase. That was the argument put forward in Nice. At Lyon – “Schiappa, will you talk about homophobia in Qatar 2022?” and “Fifa, Roxana, Schiappa: is the fight against homophobia only serious when petrodollars are not involved?” – and Nantes, Toulouse and Nîmes banners have been unfurled bearing messages hostile to the government and LFP, citing hypocrisy. The standoff between ultras and the governing bodies is more entrenched than ever.That may reflect an acceptance that the meeting scheduled for Thursday should have taken place before the season. The fan groups contacted the league this week seeking a postponement until after their annual general meeting this weekend, with the hope now that discussions will take place towards the middle of the month. Until those talks appease all sides, France’s fight against homophobia in domestic football is unlikely to be won. An issue behind which it should be easy to unite is being played out as a political game, with the schism between ultras and authorities wider than ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96111cc4435f4d937183ef2615f84aa3f2d10e3c/0_103_3984_2391/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8f59e980b845242afb5867611d9c81c","title":"mick mccarthy switzerland republic of ireland football","story":"Mick McCarthy’s first stint as the Republic of Ireland manager ended in 2002 with a home defeat by Switzerland.

They are five points ahead of Denmark and six ahead of Switzerland, albeit having played more matches than both.Séamus Coleman said he and his teammates are enthused by what they could achieve against Switzerland, who are ranked 11th in the world, 21 places above Ireland. “There’s a great buzz about because of the calibre of the team we’re playing but also the points we’ve got on the board already and how we’ve played in some of the games,” the Ireland captain said. “So it’s very exciting and we’re looking forward to it.”The likelihood is that McCarthy will pick at least 10 of the 11 players who started June’s 2-0 win over Gibraltar, with Glen Whelan returning to midfield the only change. The manager says, however, that his team could benefit from the fact that since then Sheffield United and Aston Villa have been playing in the Premier League there are four United players in the squad along with Villa’s Conor Hourihane. Most are likely to start, including Enda Stevens at left-back and the forward pairing of Callum Robinson and McGoldrick.A concern is that none of the forwards have scored an international goal but McCarthy says Robinson, for one, will take encouragement from opening his Premier League account in Sheffield United’s draw at Chelsea last weekend.“He is on a high,” McCarthy said. “He was excellent against Gibraltar too – one of our best players – and he got a goal at the weekend and has a big smile on his face. He’s a great kid. I think he’s just feeling really good about himself. If he starts, it will benefit us.”Republic of Ireland (4-3-3, probable): Randolph Coleman, Duffy, Keogh, Stevens Hendrick, Hourihane, Whelan Robinson, McGoldrick, McClean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8d6d83db3f4027fb0b46ad276404d988154533f/0_325_4875_2925/master/4875.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c80e218793993e07cdad554d223c696d","title":"from delhi street child to acclaimed photographer vicky roy in pictures","story":"Vicky Roy has gone from surviving in a railway station on food scrounged from a train to an award-winning career in photography.

(If you’re wondering why the song only became so popular recently, it’s because it was featured on the Netflix romcom Someone Great, which came out in April.)So did she steal Mina Lioness’s tweet? Not according to Lizzo. When confronted about the meme in early 2018, the singer tweeted: “Ive never seen this before in my life…But u know…The odds of multiple people having the same idea are VERY high.”Shortly after that, however, Lizzo tweeted Mina Lioness and explained:The 2018 back-and-forth didn’t get much attention. However, the controversy flared back up again last week after Mina Lioness discovered that Lizzo, now a mega-star, had filed a trademark application. “What I cannot get over is how brazen Lizzo and her team have been in ignoring my whole presence,” Mina Lioness tweeted on Saturday. “They’re doing it because they know I have no capital to address her. I’m just the poor Black girl from London that don’t have a dog in the fight.”Here’s the thing: even if Lizzo did take Mina Lioness’s tweet, it doesn’t really matter when it comes to intellectual property (IP) law. Simply tweeting a phrase doesn’t grant you any legal rights.Deborah Peckham, an IP specialist at Boston-based law firm Burns \u0026amp Levinson, notes that if Mina Lioness had commercialized her tweet by, for example, printing it on T-shirts, or using it as a tagline for services, then she might have grounds to contest Lizzo’s trademark application. However, “merely saying a short phrase or word in public doesn’t give you a legal monopoly over it”.Mina Lioness isn’t the only person to have found this out the hard way. Speaking over the phone, Matt Schimkowitz, senior editor at Know Your Meme (the Wikipedia of memes) notes that “Peaches Monroee has claimed for years now that she got unfairly treated in the ‘on fleek’ trend, when people were putting it on T-shirts without crediting her.”To refresh your memory: Monroee, whose real name is Kayla Newman, popularized the phrase ‘“on fleek” in 2014 when the teenager uploaded a Vine of herself saying “eyebrows on fleek”. The short video got over 20m views in five months and it wasn’t long before brands had appropriated it for marketing tweets, like Ihop’s “pancakes on fleek” tweet.Nicki Minaj also used the phrase in her hit song Feeling Myself, and took credit for introducing it to the world. Minaj even called out singer Christina Milian for printing “On Fleek” on T-shirts, joking that she was waiting for her percentage of the royalties. It seems like the only person who didn’t monetize the meme was the young black woman who created it.Kids getting exploited for their unpaid viral labour is, of course, how the digital economy tends to work. Schimkowitz notes that “a lot of people who are creating memes are teenagers” who don’t automatically protect their viral creations with trademark applications. And while monetizing memes may be a modern phenomenon, Schimkowitz points out that “marketing people taking trends from teens is not a new thing – that’s being happening since they invented teenagers”.This isn’t to say that young meme-makers never profit from their viral frame. However, it does seem that the kids who get credit for their creations tend to be white, while the kids who have their work appropriated tend to be black. In 2016, for example, a teenager called Daniel Lara shot to international fame after a video of his friend yelling “Damn Daniel, back at it again with the white Vans” went viral. Lara got a lifetime supply of Vans, was invited on Ellen, and trademarked the phrase Damn Daniel through the company Damn Daniel LLC.Danielle Bregoli, who went viral in 2016 for saying what sounded like “Cash me ousside” and “how bout dat” on Dr Phil, has also cashed in on her 15 minutes of fame. She trademarked both phrases and has threatened legal action against companies using them. Bregoli now has a $1m publishing deal with Pulse Music Group and a $900,000 partnership with CopyCat Beauty. All thanks to going viral when she was 13.Now, let’s say you’ve just fired off a hilarious tweet and are watching it transform into a viral meme in front of your eyes. If you call up a trademark lawyer quickly enough, are you going to be laughing all the way to the bank? Not necessarily.Sometimes memes or phrases become so ubiquitous that they are impossible to trademark. Peckham notes, for example, that that US Trademark Office declined to register applications to trademark OCCUPY WALL STREET (yes, I regret to inform you people really tried to trademark OCCUPY), explaining that “the more commonly a phrase is used, the less likely that the public will use it to identify only one source and the less likely that it will be recognized by purchasers as a trademark”.Ultimately, says Peckham, there are two big lessons to take away from the Lizzo trademark dispute. First, “if you want to protect or leverage your great idea or catchy phrase, you should act fast before it goes viral”.Second, the internet always wins in the end. “Even if the law isn’t on the side of the original writer of the tweet, the power of the internet might still ensure that a second user (Lizzo) cannot cash in by getting a monopoly on the phrase either. The internet will likely own it in the long run … which means we can all go on claiming we are all that bitch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f20f920f5ed52e0403de8d4812f40b4c69dc83ba/449_312_917_550/master/917.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e454c78ecc22cc87c41ec54937db71ce","title":"you never forget the first time how i lost my investment virginity","story":"Many of us have the sense that our money could be doing more than sitting in a savings account, albeit with some apprehension about what else to do with it. But for Danielle Graph, becoming a first-time investor was less scary than it seemedI’m a control freak. It isn’t my most endearing quality, but it does mean that when it comes to things such as life admin and money matters, I try to heed the girl scout motto and be prepared for every eventuality. But, for some reason, I’ve never tried investing before.I’m lucky enough to have a few work-based pensions, which will apparently provide me with a grand sum of £365 per month to help me heat my home and fill my shopping trolley, once I’m of retirement age. And because I’m constantly thinking and worrying about the future, whenever I’ve found myself with any financial headroom, I’ve been diligent about saving.At the moment, though, I’m finding that, week-by-week, I’m just getting by. I work for a website part-time and my husband is in the luxury goods market, which has been hit by the recent economic uncertainty. Plus, our cost of living just seems to keep on rising – our car, our kids’ after-school clubs, even our cats seem to be getting more expensive.So I’ve decided to try to improve our financial future by dipping my toe into the big wide world of investments. This is completely new territory for me. My only experience of investment pretty much extends to watching Damian Lewis in Billions. Indeed, when people tell me that they “invest”, I can’t help picturing a 1980s yuppie in pinstripes and braces, shouting “loadsamoney” into a brick mobile phone. Can this really be for me?I start researching investments online: the words float across the screen like a different language. I wonder to myself why I’ve never tried investing before? Perhaps it has something to do with my control-freak tendencies? And yet, deciding to invest actually feels like taking control. So, undeterred by some of the jargon I encounter online, I take £1,000 out of our stagnant savings and resolve to try and make it grow. Watch out Wall Street, this twice failing maths GCSE pupil is coming for you.No matter how much I psych myself up, however, the shameful truth is I still have no idea where to really begin. So I turn to my bank, HSBC, and phone its investment helpline. I kick off my chat with the super helpful specialist by asking her to explain everything as if she’s talking to a five-year-old. I tell her I have £1,000 to invest, where do I start? (Though it’s worth noting that you can start investing in some places from only £100.)For a Joe Average like me, the specialist explains that this isn’t some get rich quick scheme, but instead to think about this for the long term – at least a five-year timeframe. Mentally, I start planning a family holiday to Disney World five years down the line. She then checks that I’ve got an emergency fund in place for dealing with any unexpected expenses. Next, we chat about how I might make the best decision for me, where I’d feel most comfortable putting my money and about the various investment options that are available. I make notes – lots of notes. It’s a lot of information to absorb, but once I have the basics, I hang up the phone and bolster what I’ve just been told with information from HSBC’s website, where everything is clearly covered. Then I phone back the helpline with further queries. This approach seems to work best for me, and gives me the best of both worlds: the personal touch over the telephone, plus the chance to supplement what I learn in my own time and at my own pace. Helpfully, everything I’ve discussed with the specialist is available online, including a timely reminder that, when it comes to investments, I may not get back what I put in – along with a brilliant jargon buster which has found itself a special place in my bookmarks toolbar.I focus on three distinct investment options. The first involves opening an account to buy shares in inidual companies – companies whose shares are publicly traded in the stock market. I keep visualising shares as if they’re slices of one giant pizza – the publicly-traded companies get sliced into so many pieces, and you then can buy a slice, or a few slices. Of course, it would have to be the world’s biggest pizza given the sheer number of shares that are typically issued. Plus, it starts making me hungry. The second option involves putting your money into a fund-based investment. A fund is basically a group of investors who collectively put their money together in one basket, and that money is spread out, across a whole range of investments.Thirdly, you can invest in a portfolio, which is basically a collection of different funds.All of these options can also can be undertaken via a stocks and shares ISA (Inidual Savings Accounts). The benefits of an ISA are that you don’t pay income or capital gains tax on what you earn, but you are limited to a maximum of £20,000 investment per year. You can split your ISA allowance between stocks and shares, and cash – a cash ISA being similar to a savings account that offers instant access to your money. A stocks and shares ISA could potentially earn you more money than the alternative, however, there is a greater risk attached, as your money is invested in stocks and shares, which can go down, as well as up.As one of my cats peers over the top of my laptop, meowing for yet more food, she reminds me of all our day-to-day expenses and why I need to try and secure a better financial future for my family. Taking in two kittens from a cat shelter seemed like the best idea at the time, but I had no idea they’d bump up our monthly costs by a rather massive £100, for cat food, litter and insurance.Now that I’m armed with decidedly more knowledge than when I started, I brew a strong cup of Earl Grey, crack open a packet of shortbread and mull over how I want to lose my investment virginity. I decide I don’t want any additional tax worries (who does?) which is why I’m going down the ISA route. I’m also looking for an investment that doesn’t require any work on my part, which is why I opt for something HSBC calls a “managed” solution, which means they take care of managing my funds and keep me updated in regular statements. I choose a stocks and shares ISA which invests in funds, rather than the alternative which invests in shares on the stock market. For the final step, I go through an online process using HSBC’s My Investment tool, which involves answering multiple, intricate questions about my finances, assessing if I can afford to invest, and delving deeply into how I feel about risk. The depth of the questions reassures me rather than puts me off – and it’s been written in a plain, easy to understand language. The tool processes my answers and conclude that I’m a person who’s comfortable with risk – so I opt for the high risk portfolio it recommends.The cost of setting up my ISA is £7.50 with an estimated* £4.50 per annum account fee. It’s been surprisingly straightforward and I bask in the positive feeling of having taken some control over my money. In fact, when I log in to my online banking app moments later, there sits my ISA account, holding my £1,000. I take a mental picture of the moment. After all, you never forget your first time.To invest or access investment advice through HSBC you must be and existing HSBC UK current or savings account customer.

His flowing and authoritative interpretation of the latter’s 7th symphony foregrounded the music’s beauty but not at the expense of structureBernard Haitink’s final UK concert was always going to be a big event. Outside the Albert Hall, the day began with a queue for arena tickets forming before most people had eaten breakfast. It ended inside with the audience on its feet, the arena full of glowing smartphone screens as people took the pictures that would prove they had been there. The performance lived up to all of that: here was evidence that some conductors’ powers don’t diminish with age.Haitink, who celebrated his 90th birthday in the spring, had chosen to bow out in front of the Vienna Philharmonic with Beethoven and Bruckner: this short concert series taking in the major European festivals, ending in Lucerne on Friday, was billed as a farewell tour. With Murray Perahia ill, the piano soloist in Beethoven’s Concerto No 4 was Emanuel Ax, ideally teamed with Haitink and the orchestra in an ensemble interpretation that was elegant and often deceptively gentle, any gestures at aggression quickly tempered, but with genuine darkness at its heart. The piano trills that led the slow movement towards its close were fearsome, the music around them pregnant with possibility. Ax’s encore, Schubert’s Impromptu Op 142, No 2, was perfectly judged for the occasion – simple, reflective and meaningful, without upstaging what had gone before.For Haitink, though, the last word had to be from Bruckner. The Symphony No 7 was where we got to luxuriate in the sound he drew from the Vienna Phil, with its velvety strings and its perfectly blended brass section. The ensemble breathed together each time the opening melody bloomed, and sounded almost like an organ during the climactic second-movement passage when Bruckner gave us just a glimpse of the size of the work we were listening to. Haitink’s pacing was masterful, and the special yet contained sound at that moment was characteristic of it. It’s a cliche to talk of Bruckner’s vast symphonies as cathedrals in sound: it suggests you can see the whole edifice from the start, which is a forbidding and limiting way to think about music that is so beautiful in the moment. Perhaps it would be better to think of a journey on a dark underground river, with the conductor holding the lantern: you can see each rock formation as you pass, but only towards the end does someone turn on a light and make you realise you have been passing through every inch of a vast and spectacular cavern.Haitink, as ever, emphasised beauty over structure, yet did not allow the music’s sense of shape to slacken for a moment. One episode flowed into the next, Bruckner’s melodies coming back again and again, inevitably yet never quite predictably, turning themselves upside-down and back to front. Standing behind a music stand that held a score he didn’t even bother to open, or seated on a high stool, Haitink retained his old, almost birdlike poise and precision of movement, and kept his authority even when the orchestra weren’t playing: a genial flick of the hand at the start told the audience to stop cheering and let him get on with it another broke the thick silence that followed the symphony’s final note.According to his programme biography, Haitink is not retiring, merely taking a sabbatical. He’ll always be welcome back.• Available for 30 days on BBC Sounds.

Nowadays, they live off the coast of Cannes on Île Saint-Honorat, an inexpensive ferry hop away. The island of Sainte-Marguerite, next door, is where the Man in the Iron Mask was held prisoner. Taste the wine on a tour of the cellars and hike the wild coves and beaches.Discover impressionism among Nice’s leafy Roman suburb, CimiezThe Romans founded the city of Cemenelum in the hills above modern-day Nice (the amphitheatre ruins are a great picnic spot), and Queen Victoria holidayed here centuries later. Visit the Musée Matisse, close to where French painter Henri Matisse lived, and a few streets away, fellow impressionist painter Marc Chagall’s museum, of whom Picasso said: “When Matisse dies, Chagall will be the only painter who understands what colour really is.” Entry is free to both museums with the French Riviera pass.Ride the oceanside train from MonacoThe major towns on the Côte d’Azur are linked by a coastal train route, which for a few euros offers unrivalled views and avoids the traffic – it takes just 25 minutes from Monte Carlo to Nice (the same again to Cannes), and only 15 minutes from Nice to Antibes. Take in some literature as you rumble through the region think Francois Sagan’s Bonjour Tristesse (set on the Côte d’Azur and one of Le Monde’s 100 best books of the century) or F Scott Fitzgerald’s Tender is the Night, which used the majestic Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes as a backdrop. Pick up some fritters from the stalls at Condamine market in Monte Carlo for your journey they’re called Barbajuan (uncle John), named after the man who supposedly fried his ravioli when he couldn’t find any sauce to accompany them.Discover traditional fishing life at Port de l’OlivetteThe Grimaldi family’s 14th-century chateau forms the cultural heart of Antibes’ old town, and houses the Picasso museum, where he painted for six months in 1946. Traditional fishing still happens at Port de l’Olivette, on the other side of the bay. Have a drink, watching the sailors come and go on wooden boats.Swim in Billionaires’ Bay at Cap d’AntibesThe 5km hike from Plage de la Garoupe winds its way gently up and around Antibes’ headland, over rocky outcrops and through the scent of wild herbs. Stop for a swim in Billionaires’ Bay, admiring some of the most expensive houses in the region from the turquoise waters below.Tuck into street food at Nice’s flower marketLocal farmers have been selling their wares under the striped awnings of Nice’s Cours Saleya market since 1897. Just like Marché Forville in Cannes, it’s a great place to people-watch and become acquainted with tasty street food. Legend has it that the batter for the local chickpea pancake, socca, was poured on the heads of invading Turks in the 16th century. It was later served up to peasants throughout the 19th century, as an afternoon snack or merenda. Socca is cooked like a crepe, costs next to nothing and is beloved by renowned chefs such as Yotam Ottolenghi. The region is also home to pan bagnat, a sandwich made from wheat bread called pain de campagne (literally “bread from the countryside”), rubbed with garlic and olive oil. It’s filled with the contents of salad niçoise – boiled eggs, succulent local tomatoes, fresh tuna, anchovies (optional) and Provençal olives – and drizzled with vinegar.Cool off on Nice’s Castle HillNice’s Colline du Château once housed an impregnable fortress, which was taken down and redesigned as a park in the early 19th century for the influx of European visitors. Take the tourist train from Promenade des Anglais, ride in the lift or climb the steps (the park is 93 metres above the Baie des Anges), cooling off next to the impressive manmade waterfall, built from bricks taken from the castle’s dungeon.Visit Cannes’ medieval fortress and fishing quarterIn the 12th century, the monks built a coastal fortress called Musée de la Castre, which today houses an eclectic art collection. Climb its 109 steps for sublime 360-degree views over the small fishing village of Le Suquet, which grew over the course of 400 years into present-day Cannes.

The former cabinet minister Rory Stewart tweeted on Wednesday morning: “The recent EU ‘negotiation’ has been a sham.”On Wednesday afternoon, Johnson’s envoy to the EU, David Frost, will be in Brussels with a team of British officials for his latest round of talks with the commission’s negotiating team but there is little confidence that new thinking will emerge from either side.Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device in the Withdrawal Agreement intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic. This would keep the Good Friday agreement intact.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The DUP have objected to it, as it potentially treats Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK, creating a customs ide in the Irish sea, which is anathema to the unionist party.Hardline Tory Eurosceptics also object to it, as they perceive it to be a trap that could potentially lock the UK into the EU\u0027s customs union permanently if the UK \u0026amp EU cannot seal a free trade agreement. That would prevent the UK from doing its own free trade deals with nations outside the bloc.\u0026nbspA legal add-on to the withdrawal agreement was given to Theresa May in January 2019 to try and get her deal through the UK parliament. It gives legal force to a letter from Jean-Claude Juncker and Donald Tusk, the presidents of the commission and council. This stated the EU’s intention to negotiate an alternative to the backstop so it would not be triggered, or, if it was triggered, to get out of it as quickly as possible.Unilateral statement from the UK\u0026nbspThis set out the British position that, if the backstop was to become permanent and talks on an alternative were going nowhere, the UK believes it would be able to exit the arrangement.Additional language in political declaration\u0026nbspThis emphasises the urgency felt on both sides to negotiate an alternative to the backstop, and flesh out what a technological fix would look like. However, it failed to persuade the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, who said that while it \u0027reduces the risk\u0027 of the UK being trapped in a backstop indefinitely, it does not remove it.Prime minister Boris Johnson\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspdeclared the Northern Ireland backstop “dead”\u0026nbspduring his leadership campaign, and promised to throw it out of any deal he re-negotiated with the EU. The EU has repeatedly stated that it will not re-open the Withdrawal Agreement for re-negotiation.\u0026nbspMichel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, have repeatedly said it is for the British government to put forward any alternative arrangement for the backstop given it is a UK request for it to be ditched.A commission spokeswoman on Wednesday said that Juncker had “recalled” at a meeting of commissioners earlier in the day “that it’s the UK’s responsibility to come forward with concrete proposals that are operational and also compatible with withdrawal agreement”.The British government insists parliament will not accept a deal that includes the backstop, which entails the whole of the UK, albeit temporarily, staying in a customs union and Northern Ireland remaining in the single market.On Tuesday, the prime minister told the Commons the government did recognise that “for reasons of geography and economics, agri-food is increasingly managed on a common basis across the island of Ireland”.The comments suggested Johnson is willing to accept what one EU official described as a “lightweight backstop” that would involve checks on agri-goods moving between Northern Ireland and Britain but ensure an open border for those goods on the island of Ireland.The prime minister is due to meet the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, on Monday in Dublin, where he will expand on the approach.But the plan, which is due to be raised by Frost in this week’s talks, leaves open the question of how non-agricultural goods will be checked in a post-Brexit environment when the north and south of Ireland erge in terms of regulations.The European commission is concerned that reliance on technology and the creation of new frontier regulatory areas in which checks would be carried out would fail to live up to the commitments of the Good Friday agreement to protect the all-island economy.In response to Johnson’s claim that progress is being made in the talks, EU officials have instead warned that the discussions are “going nowhere”, and that the seemingly imminent general election in the UK will bring them to a complete halt.A UK government spokesman conceded that there was yet to be a meeting of minds in the talks but said the pace of negotiations would be intensified this month.“He will be supported in Brussels by an expert team from across government that have expertise in regulations and customs.“The team intends to run through a range of issues including the removal of the backstop. The prime minister has been clear that there will be no deal unless the withdrawal agreement is reopened and the backstop taken out.“Discussions so far have shown that the two sides remain some distance apart on key issues but are willing to work hard to find a way through.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b973e4e38b7443a0c62f0a30e98a9bbe606524b/549_320_1753_1052/master/1753.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32882c8a1693ef8a3333fd7193443b5e","title":"jeremy corbyn faces labour backlash over election strategy","story":"Majority of MPs believe leader should not agree to election before no-deal Brexit ruled outJeremy Corbyn is facing a backlash from Labour MPs who fear they will be playing into Boris Johnson’s hands if they back a general election before 31 October.A meeting of the parliamentary Labour party (PLP) was hastily convened on Wednesday morning to allow MPs to express their concerns about the idea of going to the polls before a no-deal Brexit on the Halloween deadline has been ruled out.One veteran Labour MP said the overwhelming view was that Corbyn should reject an election before 31 October. They said: “The one thing we must not do with a thoroughly untrustworthy person such as this prime minister is fight an election on his terms. We wait until after he has gone to the EU and see what he comes back with.”Another said there were some Labour MPs who favoured an immediate election. “We should not give them a chance to accuse us of running away,” one said. A third MP said the view that an election should not be held until after 31 October was confined to “the usual suspects”.The prime minister announced on Tuesday night that he would table a motion under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, seeking to call a general election.Corbyn immediately told the House of Commons Labour would not support an election until legislation drawn up by backbench rebels aimed at ruling out a no-deal Brexit had been passed.The prime minister needs a two-thirds majority to pass the motion and trigger a snap election, with Downing Street pencilling in 15 October as a potential polling day. The motion was due to be voted on later on Wednesday.Corbyn held a meeting with fellow opposition leaders on Wednesday morning, telling them he would support a general election – but only after the threat of a no-deal Brexit had been removed.The rebels’ bill would mandate Johnson to request a three-month extension to article 50 if he has not secured a new Brexit deal by 19 October.They hope the legislation could pass all its parliamentary stages this week – potentially clearing the way for Labour to support a general election if the government tabled another amendment on Monday.But many Labour MPs are nervous that backing a 15 October election could allow the prime minister to press ahead with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October, if the public hand Johnson a majority.One shadow cabinet member said it would be “wholly irresponsible” to accept an election before 31 October. Another MP accused the Labour leadership of drawing up its strategy based on placard-waving protesters in Westminster.Several senior Labour figures, including the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, spoke at a People’s Assembly rally on Tuesday evening organised under the slogan “Stop Boris Johnson! Tories Out! We Demand a General Election Now!”Nick Brown, Labour’s chief whip, will ask the party’s MPs to abstain on the Johnson motion on Wednesday night to try to force an early general election.Brown told the meeting on Wednesday some MPs could vote against the motion if they had already made a public statement on the vote. “He made it clear that if a previous commitment has been made, that is a perfectly acceptable,” a source said.Lady Angela Smith warned the meeting that the large number of amendments tabled in the Lords as a filibustering measure could well mean all-night sittings that spill into next week, a source said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80fd227deca6f60ff513f9dbc24c42e6699aa661/0_1837_3587_2151/master/3587.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b171b02c8ad9da87f3bfc97a97c25954","title":"more than 100000 people apply register vote youth uk general election","story":"Young people make up bulk of new applications, with Britain poised for snap general electionMore than 100,000 people have applied to register to vote in the past 48 hours, with young people making up the bulk of the surge.On Monday, 52,408 applications were submitted, according to government figures, followed by 64,485 on Tuesday.To vote in a general election you must:You also need to be on the electoral register.

If you live in Northern Ireland you need to contact\u0026nbspthe Electoral Office for Northern Ireland (EONI).The figure on both days, against a backdrop of momentous political events at Westminster, was significantly above the typical number for weekday applications, which has been averaging at about 27,000 for the past month.By contrast, the two largest groups by age were 25-34, who numbered more than 19,800 on Tuesday, and those aged under 25, who made up more than 17,000 on the same day.The deadline for applying to register to vote would be 27 September if a snap general election were to take place on 15 October, as Downing Street is understood to be planning.The surge in youth registration was welcomed in particular by pro-remain campaigners, who have been using social media to encourage registration in anticipation of a ballot.Describing the 48-hour increase as “great news”, the actor and comedian Rob Delaney tweeted: “No-deal Brexiteers’ greatest fears are new voters and young voters.”Hope Not Hate, which has been involved in voter registration drives as part of its campaign work, said: “It’s critical that young people register to vote because right now they’re needed more than ever to stand up for a tolerant and inclusive society.”“All our work and research shows that it’s young people who most believe in a country where everyone who lives here feels welcome, and where there is friendship and understanding between communities.”Dr Emily Rainsford of Newcastle University, an expert in youth political participation, said the figures were significant but they should be read with some caution in terms of their potential electoral impact.“There is an increase in political engagement when the stakes seem to be higher or events are seen as directly affecting you, but it’s across the board. You tend to see a pronounced interest from young people in voter registration for example, but older people will also be motivated and that tends not to show until an election itself,” she said.Rainsford said there had been similar surges in registration in the past, such as in June 2016 when the government website crashed hours before the deadline to vote in the EU referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e6f6ef2e3a2549d39d32ef85a682d8b220e8e4a/114_0_3256_1955/master/3256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2425f67af17e73acc199022fbddcb2ec","title":"sajid javid promises decade renewal sets out post brexit spending","story":"Chancellor announces extra £13.4bn for 2020-21 and vows to build a ‘global Britain’The chancellor, Sajid Javid, has promised “a decade of renewal” after he set out plans for government spending covering the first year outside the EU, with an extra £13.4bn in public spending for 2020-21.Speaking in the Commons to announce the spending review, he said the cost of government borrowing had fallen to historic lows, giving the government further room to increase spending.“We will bring about a decade of renewal. We will build a global Britain where we will walk tall,” he said.No government department will have its budget cut next year in real terms, he said, adding that this protection “is what I mean by the end of austerity”.Javid said the government’s commitment to boost spending was reflected in a three-year spending pledge for education, contrasting with the one-year commitments to other departments.He said the government would set aside £2bn in addition to the £6bn already allocated for preparations related to leaving the EU without a deal. There will be an extra £6.2bn next year for the NHS, including a £2bn boost to new hospital building and maintenance. There will be an extra £1.8bn for education, a rise of £1.1bn in the annual police budget by 2021-22 and a rise in local government funding of £3.5bn next year, including £1.5bn extra for social care.“A good school, inspirational teachers, are the most effective engine for social mobility that there is. That’s why today we are delivering on our pledge to increase school spending by £7.1bn by 2022-23,” he said.Businesses have complained that the threat of a no-deal Brexit, alongside slowing global trade, has deterred customers from spending, forcing firms to reduce investment and cut employment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4c2bd0a7fb70e92c6c5af31aaad7a7d5555c26a7/0_235_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b0ea7482dff58ae08b528aebba35ca4","title":"spending review 2019 the chancellors key points at a glance","story":"Sajid Javid is delivering his spring statement – here are the main points, with political analysis• Sajid Javid announces £2bn for Brexit delivery next year.

The recruitment drive simply restores some of the 20,000-plus officers cut since 2010.• He says the overall departmental spending on local authorities will be the largest increase in local government spending power since 2010.• Javid promises £54m of new funding to address homelessness and rough sleeping.• There will be £241m next year from the new towns fund to help regenerate town centres’ high streets.Patrick Butler, social policy editor: The extra money for social care is the bare minimum councils have suggested was required to stop parts of the adult social care system in England from collapsing over the next few months.

There are already concerns that schools in Tory rural and marginal constituencies will benefit most, ahead of those in deprived areas.• Javid promises to “put the wheels back on the Great British bus” with more than £200m to transform bus services across the country, funding low-emission buses and trialling on-demand services.Gwyn Topham, transport correspondent: Details are to follow, Javid said, but the Great British bus might remain a wheel or two short. The government has averaged £250m a year investment, along with about £1bn to help subsidise free bus passes, but bus routes have shrunk as indirect funding, via cash-starved councils, has dried up.• The chancellor says he will increase NHS spending by £6.2bn next year.• He says there will be £210m for frontline NHS staff.• The Treasury will invest more in training and professional development for doctors and nurses.• Javid says there will be more than £2bn of new capital funding – starting with an upgrade to 20 hospitals this year, and £250m for new artificial intelligence technologies.• He also announces £7m of funding for the Normandy Memorial Trust and confirms funding for the new Office for Veterans’ Affairs, previously announced at £5m.Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor: Defence had been tipped to be one of the losers in the spending round in early briefings, but the prime minister intervened, markedly raising the proposed increase from about £800m.

Hmm... it’s almost like the vagaries of British weather can make a fool of anyone.”“In a DRS universe,” says Mark Gillespie, “the Australians would have been able to review the Stokes LBW at Headingley, and would have won the game. Oh, wait...”Arf. I’m convinced the ball-tracking was wrong on that LBW appeal as it missed a slight deflection off the front pad. If so, that’s pretty alarming. “I’ve never been convinced by Root as captain,” says James Brough. “He’s had about 30 Tests as captain, and I still couldn’t say what type of captain he is. With most captains, after that number of Tests, you’d have an idea of their style- Gower was out of his depth, Strauss was meticulous and calculating, Vaughan aggressive, Gooch led by example. What can you say of Root’s captaincy? I still can’t see anything inidual in it.”That’s a terrific point.

Roger Woolley. Two catches, versus Sri Lanka, 1983. In fact, I’m declaring that the best cricket stat of all time. Any competitors?”Oh yes. Nothing will ever top this from the Gaffer. There’s no way this is a coincidence.Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. September rain, eh. It’s all a bit frustrating, although the forecast for the rest of the day - and the rest of the match - is more promising.That’s enough for me today, as the ground staff get their brooms out and huddle in their hoods. To mop things up for us it will be the reliable Rob Smyth.The rain has stopped, and the soppers are doing their best to mop things up. It’s just gone 3pm. Not sure what our chances are of getting on.We might as well deal with a cranky one, since I’m sure many more people will be expostulating similarly to David. “Who was the idiot who scheduled a Test match for Manchester in September? It is the wettest place in England most times of the year. I cannot remember a Test being held in the north in September. It does not take a genius to predict this type of weather.”To begin with, there was more than one idiot, because there was a World Cup involved and a lot of people trying to fit a lot of cricket into one summer. Secondly, average rainfall for Manchester is higher in August. So had it been held in August then presumably everyone would have been idiots if it rained then too. Thirdly, average rainfall in July is marginally behind September, so that would have been another idiot month. Six of seven Tests were washed out draws from the First World War until Laker (apt name) in 1956. Lots of Tests before that were played on sticky dogs. Ponting’s draw in 2005 was only possible because of a rain day. Rain in Manchester is a thing that happens. They also manage to play cricket here. And they’ve had some of the most memorable Tests in history. That’s the deal. Getting angry at it might seem slightly...Now we’re playing the waiting game, which indeed sucks and would be best replaced by Hungry Hungry Hippos.“Thanks for putting up that Cricket Supporters survey, which I have completed,” writes John Starbuck. “I note they don’t address the cricket-following option of a webcam at county grounds plus local BBC radio commentary. This is now my main way of watching the county championship and really ought to become widespread. It’s another part of the mix but not an ECB thing. Or is it?”That’s not a question I can answer but someone else might be able to.That wind is sending cartwheeling volleys of spume into the air, lifted off the tarpaulins and vaulted across the ground. The really heavy blast of rain has blown over already, replaced by lighter fall. The ground will be drenched though. The rain is back. Dampen your expectations, it’s sheeting down all of a sudden. The big covers are back in place, despite fighting the ground staff every step of the way. “Since it seems England have tried everything else to get Smith out, how about some medium pace bowling? When I was a pie-chucker in my youth, I had unexpectedly good figures. Admittedly they were all catches in the outfield from mishit slogs, but a wicket is a wicket. I do realise I’m clutching at straws, but so is every England cricket fan. Is this an example of ‘so crazy it might just work’?” Well... no, Tom Fairbairn. That’s a nice surname by the way. I assume it means ‘beautiful child’. Tom, my sweet child. Trash gets wickets up to a point, because batsmen who aren’t very good will try to slog everything. Even good players get out when they slog everything. Viz Steve Smith getting out to Derbyshire’s part-time leggie Matthew Critchley last week. What makes them good players is that they have the restraint to resist slogging everything, and instead just calmly and sensibly score off everything instead. Anyway, he’s only on 28. Don’t hit the red button yet.(Slowly, gingerly. One at a time. It’s not as sensual as I’m making it sound.)Derek Fordham replies. “Forty years ago, when I was an eager U16 cricketer, our coach often used to tell us that the Somerset opening pair of Dross and Crapp used to open the bowling for England. I am sure that if I Google this fact it will prove to be untrue, and so I never have and never will.”Finbar Anslow sends a poser to get us through the rain. “Hi Geoff, delightful afternoon here on LombardyPiedmont border. Just wondering if two Somerset bowlers have bowled in tandem for England before?”Somerset hasn’t produced a whole lot of Test bowlers, so that does limit the options. The best bets? Vic Marks and Ian Botham played a few Tests together in the 1980s. And... Marcus Trescothick reeled off 14 overs and took his only Test wicket in Karachi in 2000, in a Test that Andy Caddick also played in. What I don’t have the means to deduce is whether either of those pairings bowled in tandem. If anyone else does, by all means let us know.Here’s something to fill in your time while the sky weeps. The Cricket Supporters Association, which is a relatively new organisation, is running a survey on the state of the game. As far as I understand it, they want some information that doesn’t come through the ECB to give a picture.Have a look at the survey here.The full covers are on now, with the hovercraft in the middle. I can’t see any actual rainfall, but I don’t have the fortune of being outside to know for sure. The umpire’s umbrella is down, so I’ll take that as my reading.I’m glad to announce that the rain timed its run very considerately to match the lunch break, at least in terms of commencement. It will not be the same when it comes to resumption, however. The wind is fierce and the covers are billowing.“Archer seems to have done the bowling equivalent of splitting the atom,” suggests John. “A missile into the chops of Smith led to the unexpected yet ultra-capable Labuschagne coming straight into the team – so now there’s two of them out there on the field. Better hope they don’t take any more short balls in the grille! And, no, I’m not a physicist.”Less splitting the atom (which tends to have broader and more complete consequences) and more Mickey Mouse chopping an enchanted broomstick in half.One more wicket and it would have been England’s session, but you’d have to say that as things stand it’s Australia’s. The two batsmen who have provided most of England’s trouble in this series are doing it again: Smith taking up the attack on occasion, Labuschagne on the verge of his fourth consecutive fifty. If a wicket falls after lunch England could very quickly be amongst a few more, so there’s still a lot riding on this partnership. 26th over: Australia 98-2 (Labuschagne 49, Smith 28) Another four to start an Overton over. Labuschagne plays squarer this time, behind point, but along the ground and hit so well that it zooms to the boundary. After that he’s happy to play out the over. That’s lunch!25th over: Australia 94-2 (Labuschagne 45, Smith 28) Leach, left-arm orthodox spin, sends down another maiden to Smith.24th over: Australia 94-2 (Labuschagne 45, Smith 28) Overton, too wide to start his over, and Labuschagne drives him for four! Away through the covers, his best shot of the day. Full control. He leaves a wider one, and Overton half appeals with the cordon, thinking he might have got a lucky touch like Stuart Broad. No such. “Hi Geoff,” emails Martin Chatterton. “We once sat side by side in our underwear on a late night panel called ‘We Like It Confronting’ (or something) at the Brisbane Writer’s Festival (with Krissy Kneen and Sommer Tothill as I recall). Imagine my surprise when I tune into ’s cricket coverage and there you are doing the ball-by-ball from Manchester.”Reader, Martin is correct. I have lived many lives. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion...23rd over: Australia 90-2 (Labuschagne 41, Smith 28) Leach, driven straight by Smith for a single, then Labuschagne starts working him fairly comfortably to the leg side. First for a brace, then for one. A bit too straight. Marnus has looked largely unruffled this morning, as he largely has since being parachuted into the series at Lord’s. 22nd over: Australia 86-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 27) Overton is getting some decent bounce when he lands it right, outside off. When he gets too straight though, Labuschagne flicks square for two runs. Too full, Labuschagne drives straight, and Overton saves a boundary by getting his boot on it, conceding two runs instead. Wasn’t far off hitting the non-striker’s stumps, and would have run out Smith if it had. Scott Roberts: “I don’t wish to be a negative Nancy, but I fear that Root’s captaincy has been shown for its frailties this morning. It looks to me like he took Archer off too soon, presumably in response to criticism of overbowling him. He picked Overton to be a bowler, but then prefers to pick Stokes as the first change, presumably on the back of the so called momentum from the last test (which I personally don’t think exists in top-class sport). I think this has the double-negative effect of making Stokes think he has to be the saviour every time, which has to be mentally exhausting, plus it cannot avoid but make Overton doubt his captain’s belief in him and wonder why he wasn’t the first change. I fear we have let Smith off the hook here by letting him get off to a comfortable start.”21st over: Australia 81-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 26) Smith gets off strike against Leach after nine sighters. Works the ball square, as he does. Marnus blots out the rest. 20th over: Australia 80-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 25) Stokes is absolutely not settling in for a long spell. He’s off. Craig Overton is on, back in the Test whites. He starts with a steady sort of over: no obvious threat, but giving little away. One run from it. Speaking of comebacks...19th over: Australia 79-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 24) Big edge from Leach! Wide of Stokes at slip. Labuschagne went hard across the line, trying to flick, but got a leading edge instead behind square. Over and wide of slip, and it flies away for two. Maybe spin will be the danger here?18th over: Australia 75-2 (Labuschagne 31, Smith 23) Stokes settling in for another long spell, perhaps. A single and a brace for Smith from the over, at the stumps.17th over: Australia 72-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 21) Jack Leach bowls a maiden, Smith very happy just to see him out.“Excuse my ignorance, but what’s the point of selecting Buttler?” writes Neil Ashby. “He’s not keeping, he’s not scoring with the bat, and he doesn’t bowl (does he?). Why not replace him with a genuine batsman, bowler or another all-rounder?”I’d say because since he came back into the Test team he’s scored more runs than anyone but Root. Hasn’t made a score in this series, but that doesn’t mean he won’t.16th over: Australia 72-2 (Labuschagne 30, Smith 21) Stokes, to Smith, and whacked away for four more! Short again, Smith steps inside the line and flips the pull shot to fine leg. So easy when you’ve made that room for the shot. Follows up with a single and he has 21 from 23. This is some decent heat to start a Test innings. Stokes nearly pickes up Labuschagne with the last ball though: it nips back sharply off the seam, but in the end is doing too much as it hits the pad in front of middle. Umpire Erasmus says no, and DRS shows umpire’s call on the very outside of the leg stump.15th over: Australia 66-2 (Labuschagne 29, Smith 16) I will confess, for a moment there, I wondered just how Nathan Lyon had come to be bowling for England against Australia. Then I realised it was Jack Leach. Similar look, the spinners, at least until they bowl with opposite arms. Leach bowls too short, twice, and Labsuchagne cuts him through point to the fence both times.14th over: Australia 57-2 (Labuschagne 20, Smith 16) Drinks had, Stokes bowling, and Smith drives him for four! That cover drive is more technical, less violent. Smith walks across, gets to it on the half volley, drives it calmly away. Stokes drops short in response so Smith wallops him on the pull shot instead, four more. This is looking ominous already. He’s doubled his score. How does he just walk in and play this way?13th over: Australia 49-2 (Labuschagne 20, Smith 8) In the space of a couple of balls, you can see the form Labuschagne has been in this English summer. Leaves a ball too wide, plays a searching ball well from the crease in defence, then as soon one pitches too full he drives it dead straight for four. Broad is excited for a moment as a flick off the pads goes in the air, but it misses midwicket comfortably for another boundary. Drinks.“Morning,” writes Smylers. “Has anybody checked that former OBOer Vish made it safely out of Leeds? I’m a little concerned after seeing this chippy on the Kirkstall Road serving Vish \u0026amp Chips.” No fear, I did see Vithushan Ehantharajah on my way into the ground this morning, and he was very much intact and dapper. 12th over: Australia 41-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 8) Ben Stokes into the attack ahead of Craig Overton. Interesting. Archer bowled only five overs. Perhaps Overton would prefer to be at Broad’s end? Broad’s spell isn’t done yet though. Stokes bowls a tidy opening over, just one run and a leg bye. 11th over: Australia 39-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 7) Broad gets a bit straight in this over. Marnus plays like Marnus, tucking a ball away sensibly for one. Smith plays like Smith, in his newly expansive mode, flicking airily through midwicket. There’s a good sliding stop that keeps the scoring to three.Here’s the TMS overseas link.10th over: Australia 35-2 (Labuschagne 11, Smith 4) Archer to Smith, and carved away for four! What a shot that is, as Archer slips too wide and full outside off, and with the whole cover region open, Smith flays through the line to the boundary. Strode into that and didn’t bother trying to keep it down, with all that space in front of him. What a way to get off the mark. The leg slip is now a conventional third slip. Archer comes back with a sizzler, cutting in off the seam and almost going over off stump as Smith leaves. Then a short ball to finish the over, making the batsman duck. The duel is back on.9th over: Australia 29-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 0) Broad is really chiselling away at this line outside off. Beats Labuschagne, challenges his pads, then has the batsman flick to short leg and overbalance... Buttler actually hits the stumps with a throw, but Marnus has just got his bat down. Maiden.8th over: Australia 29-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 0) Labuschagne stabs away a single, and the duel will recommence. Two men out for the hook, the one at square leg only three quarters of the way to the fence looking for an error. Short leg. Leg slip. Two conventional slips and a gully. And Archer starts with length, outside off. Length again. Then short, too short, easy for Smith to slip under, even as the crowd gives voice. 7th over: Australia 28-2 (Labuschagne 9) Harris gone last ball of the over. Here it comes then. Steve Smith to the crease. Jofra Archer to bowl the next set.Broad gets one! He’s had a few near things. This ball snakes in from outside off stump, around the wicket. Hits Harris high but on the back leg, and bounces off to be caught in the slips. Broad implores, waving his hands, and belatedly Kumar Dharmasena pops up the finger. There was no inside edge, as Harris reviews, and the ball is clipping leg stump, high and nearly wide. Angle and height were the issues, but it’s close enough. Australia keep the review.6th over: Australia 26-1 (Harris 11, Labuschagne 9) Archer! What was that? The most over-the-top delivery since that fop in the top hat banged on for an hour in the House of Commons last night. It soars over the wicketkeeper and away for four byes. Labuschagne follows up with a boundary off his pads. 5th over: Australia 15-1 (Harris 8, Labuschagne 5) A maiden for Broad, only making Labuschagne play a couple of times as the bowler works away outside off stump. A couple of tech issues here, apologies. Back on track now.“Prangitt here in South Oz having a beer and watching the match on the 55” PC monitor. Got the OBO on the 27” to the left. Loving your work tonight! the forgotten shopping line was great. Sorry to report I have stolen that from you.”I do it all for the people, Prang. 4th over: Australia 15-1 (Harris 8, Labuschagne 5) Archer bowls a tight over, not giving Harris much bar one straight ball worked for two runs. A good one beats the edge after that. “Is it wrong that I’ve got goosebumps?” Not at all, Christopher Mellor. “I’m sat at work pretending to be on the phone but concentrating on the cricket, I was at Headingley days 2 and 3 (dressed as wonder woman) and have been trying to get time off to go across the border in to the land that time forgot but so far alas, not been able. Looking forward to a good day.

Here’s everything you need to know.If you have a Google Pixel phone, simply check for updates in the system settings to download it over the next couple of days – or head to Google’s developer site if you are impatient.Unusually for Android, other manufacturers have joined the early release schedule. A full Android 10 update is available for the Essential Phone globally and the Xiaomi Redmi K20 Pro in China and India. Meanwhile, OnePlus has released Android 10 for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro in “open beta”, which is part of the firm’s long-running early access software series.Many other manufacturers are still running developer previews of Android 10 and are expected to release full versions soon. One of the biggest exceptions is Samsung, which is not expected to release Android 10 for at least a few months.The update from Google and other manufacturers is free. If you are asked to pay to update it is likely to be a scam.The majority of the apps on your phone will work as normal. Some may need small updates for full compatibility, but many of those apps have already received the necessary updates including from companies such as Samsung for support of its smartphone accessories on other company’s phones.Google has introduced a new gesture navigation system as part of Android 10, which sits alongside the traditional three-button and Google’s Android 9 Pie two-button navigation options.The new navigation gestures are a blend of those used by Apple on its iPhone X, XS and XR lines and those deployed by manufacturers such as Huawei and OnePlus.There is a new thin gesture bar at the bottom of the screen. Swiping up on it goes home, up and hold shows recently used apps swiping left or right on the bar switches directly between the last-used apps. The back button has been replaced by a swipe from the left or right sides of the lower portions of the screen.The new gestures are fast, smooth and make using large-screen phones much easier, particularly the back swipe gesture, which no longer forces a reach to the bottom left of the phone to tap the back button.Many Android manufacturers have implemented their own dark themes, including Samsung, Huawei and OnePlus. But now Google has added a full dark mode baked into Android 10, which can be enabled all the time or through a schedule. It joins the dark theme added to a variety of Google and other apps available on Android.For those with OLED screens, such as those used on higher-end smartphones, enabling the dark theme can help prolong battery life as only the pixels that are not black consume electricity. But most people will enable it for aesthetic reasons.Smart replies have been expanded from a very limited number of Google apps to most messaging apps, which uses on-device machine learning to provide you with one-tap replies to messages straight from the notification area.It can also open the appropriate app for things like an address, URL or video straight from the messaging app without having to copy or paste anything, such as giving one-tap access to navigation directions in Google Maps.To help reduce notification overload, Android now has the choice of: general alerts as they always have been, which make a sound or vibration silent alerts, which do not make a sound and are held in a cluster out of the way at the bottom of the notification shade or no notification, which blocks an app from showing particular types of notifications or all notifications if you do not want to be bothered by them.Silent notifications are useful for things such apps for accessories that you have attached to your phone requiring persistent notifications to work (sports watches are a good example) or mundane but useful things such as the weather.Google is making great strides to give users greater control over the data they share with apps on their phone, catching up with many of the protections Apple employs in iOS. Android 10 introduces a raft of new controls including the ability to share your location information with an app only when you are using it. Android will also remind you that an app you do not use is accessing your location so you can stop it if you wish.Privacy controls including an app permission manager, personalised ads, location history and Google account activity are now more easily accessible in the settings menu too, so it’s more straightforward to see what kinds of data is being collected and stop it.Google is beefing up parental controls on Android using its Family Link feature, which will now be built into the Digital Wellbeing settings app on Android 10. Parents can set up a new phone or device for their child, link it to their account and take control over screen time limits, app installs, track their child’s usage and set a things like a bedtime when the phone shuts off.The state of Android security updates, which are delivered by Google once a month but do not always reach other manufacturer’s phones in a timely manner, is getting better, with most devices getting at least bi-monthly updates.In Android 10 a new system allows Google to push out crucial security and privacy fixes straight from the Google Play store. That means users won’t have to wait for their phone manufacturer to release a full Android system update to make sure their data is protected. Faster and more frequent security updates are becoming more and more critical as our phones are tempting targets for hackers and thieves the world over.Android 10 includes a large collection of new emoji including gender-inclusive designs, such as gender non-specific representations of professions with the option of specifying male or female models if you’d like.Focus mode, which temporarily silences specific apps you find distracting, is available in beta with a full rollout expected this year. Live Caption, which uses on-device machine learning to put real-time captions on videos, podcasts, audio messages and recordings in any app, will also roll out in the autumn, on Google’s Pixel devices at first."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/291fd3f4a7cd0d6ae33faec5eaeb62928d914a94/269_0_4029_2418/master/4029.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b003660b9fd0c40a5762a5f2208f8dda","title":"a glimpse behind the scenes of gizas grand egyptian museum","story":"Egypt’s vast, much-delayed museum is scheduled to open in 2020. But while Tutankhamun’s treasures are being readied for tourists, some critics see the building as a vanity projectIn the vast, shade-dappled atrium of Egypt’s new Grand Egyptian Museum, construction work surrounded a colossal statue of Ramses II, his left foot striding forward and fists clenched in readiness.Staff welcoming visiting journalists doled out assurances that the towering ancient sculpture was safe from the ongoing building works. On its journey to the new museum last year, the statue was accompanied by 11 horsemen in military dress, amid the sounds of the Egyptian national anthem.If promises of the museum’s imminent completion hold true, the 83-tonne depiction of the third pharaoh of the 19th dynasty of Egypt, also known as Ozymandias, will be the first sight that greets visitors as they enter the 500,000 sq metre museum next year. At more than nine metres tall, the statue almost reaches the vaulted ceiling of the cement structure that is expected to house 100,000 objects, many of which will be displayed for the first time, as well as a 250-seat 3D cinema and children’s museum. It will also have a panoramic view of the Great Pyramids of Giza. But when will it open?The $1bn museum has been plagued by delays since it was first scheduled to open in 2015, a decade after it was conceived. As construction workers filled the atrium and put finishing touches to intricate lattice-work panels that form the building’s front flank, officials said the project was almost finished. Local media recently extolled official claims that the museum will open by 2020.“The Grand Egyptian Museum is a gift from Egypt to the whole world,” said minister of antiquities, Khaled el-Enany, echoing a slogan used to promote the opening of a second Suez Canal channel in 2015, amid claims the mega-project would revitalise Egypt’s economy. Officials said they hoped the Grand Egyptian Museum would attract five million visitors every year, helping to boost tourism and, in turn, the country’s finances.The project’s engineers claim the insulated concrete design overcomes the challenge of desert temperatures, where the roof can easily heat up to 70C, keeping the interior and its precious contents at a stable 23C.The building will supersede the world-famous Egyptian Museum, sometimes called the Museum of Cairo, which was built in the centre of the city in 1901 and currently houses the world’s largest collection of Pharaonic antiquities, including the iconic gold funeral mask of Tutankhamun.The new museum will contain 7,000 sq metres dedicated to the boy-king, with the 5,400 objects retrieved from his tomb (discovered by Howard Carter in 1922) displayed together for the first time, including his three coffins and the funeral mask.One large gold-plated coffin was removed from Tutankhamun’s tomb in Luxor’s Valley of the Kings in July for the first time since its discovery, and trucked to Cairo for vital restoration work before display.“It was a delicate project, as the coffin is very fragile,” said El-Enany, stood in front of the gilded sarcophagus where it lay inside the conservation laboratory adjoining the museum. “We expect that it will take eight or nine months to reach a good enough state to display it by 2020.”Not everyone is impressed by the museum’s grand promises. “It’s a vanity project from the Hosni Mubarak regime,” said Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna, in reference to the former president who was deposed in 2011. “But we’ve inherited it, so now we have to live with it.”Mubarak’s Cairo 2050 plan, launched four years before his overthrow, envisioned displacing 7,000 citizens to build a wide tree-lined boulevard linking central Cairo to the pyramids and tourist attractions, including the Grand Egyptian Museum.“Tourists will come if we give them a different experience – we have the highest rate of non-returning tourists. Changing this means reducing harassment, proper public transport and clean bathrooms,” said Hanna. In 2018, a reported 11.3 million tourists visited Egypt, down on the pre-revolution high of 15 million in 2010.Officials remain hopeful that the new museum will gloss over Egypt’s recent troubles, including a car bomb outside a Cairo hospital in August and a roadside bomb that injured 17 when it struck a bus of tourists close to the museum site in May. British Airways provoked the ire of Egyptian ministries in July when it suspended flights to Cairo for a week, citing unnamed security concerns. Egypt’s minister of civil aviation also decided to levy a $25 service fee on all passengers departing Cairo airport beginning in November 2019, in addition to a $25 charge imposed in 2014.Yet Egyptian officials are hoping the fanfare to accompany the museum’s opening will draw visitors. “It will be an event you’ll never ever forget for the rest of your life,” promised Mostafa Waziry, head of the Supreme Council of Antiquities.Looking for a holiday with a difference?

The first release of court records unsealed the day before Epstein’s jailhouse suicide in Manhattan in August contained graphic claims against Epstein and several of his former associates.Giuffre alleges she was trafficked internationally to have sex with prominent American politicians, business executives and world leaders.Giuffre filed the lawsuit in 2015, alleging Maxwell subjected her to “public ridicule, contempt and disgrace” by calling her a liar in published statements “with the malicious intent of discrediting and further damaging Giuffre worldwide”. The lawsuit sought unspecified damages.About one-fifth of all documents filed in the case were done so under seal, a level of secrecy the second circuit ruled was unjustified. However, the appellate court, in unsealing the records, issued an unusual warning to the public and the media “to exercise restraint” regarding potentially defamatory allegations.

The vessel’s owner said it had yet to receive any official confirmation of the release date.The Swedish-owned tanker was detained by Iran’s Revolutionary Guards on 19 July, two weeks after Britain detained an Iranian tanker off the coast of Gibraltar. That vessel was released in August. “We have no problem with the crew and the captain and the issue is violations that the vessel committed,” an Iranian foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Mousavi, told the television station.Responding to the announcement, Erik Hanell, Stena Bulk’s president and chief executive, said: “We are very pleased that for seven crew members their ordeal may soon be over and they may return to their families. However, we cautiously await official confirmation of their release date.“We view this communication as a positive step on the way to the release of all the remaining crew, which has always been our primary concern and focus.” The company said the remaining 16 crew members would remain onboard to safely operate the vessel.The announcement came as Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani,said that “extraordinary” steps away from the deal, expected to be revealed this week, would not take effect until later in the year.French and Iranian diplomats have been holding talks on the future of the deal, which is at risk of unravelling since the US withdrew last year, with a focus on setting up a four-month $15bn (£12.3bn) credit line as a prepayment for Iranian oil sales.Rouhani said insufficient progress had been made for a deal to be reached ahead of a deadline on Wednesday or Thursday for Iran to announce fresh breaches of the nuclear accord, but the steps would be implemented in two months’ time.The next step is believed to focus on research and development. “The third step will be the most important one and it will have extraordinary huge effects,” Rouhani said.He said the number of disagreements in the talks between Iran and Europe might have been reduced from 20 to three, but that did not mean the talks had reached a conclusion. “Europe has another two-month deadline for negotiations, agreement, and a return to its commitments,” he said.In July 2015, Iran and a six-nation negotiating group reached a landmark agreement known as the\u0026nbspJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u0026nbspthat\u0026nbspended a 12-year deadlock\u0026nbspover Tehran’s nuclear programme. The deal, struck in Vienna after nearly two years of intensive talks, limited the Iranian programme, to reassure the rest of the world that it cannot develop nuclear weapons, in return for sanctions relief.The six major powers involved in the nuclear talks with\u0026nbspIran\u0026nbspwere in a group known as the P5+1: the UN security council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the UK and the US – and Germany. The nuclear deal is also enshrined in a UN security council resolution that incorporated it into international law. The 15 members of the council at the time unanimously endorsed the agreement.On 8 May 2018, US president Donald Trump pulled his country out of the deal. Iran announced its partial withdrawal from the nuclear deal a year later.The deal with the west was brokered in 2015 and included Iran agreeing to limit its nuclear activities in return for the lifting of economic sanctions, in particular on oil exports. But after Donald Trump withdrew the US and reimposed sanctions, Tehran has threatened the deal’s future if European countries cannot come up with a solution for Iran to sell its oil abroad.US sanctions sent Iran’s economy into freefall as tensions have also risen in the Gulf.The Iranian foreign ministry’s spokesman said the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, was in the US to try to gain US support for the French plan for a credit line, but he thought that would not come in time for the Iranian deadline.The US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, did not rule out the Macron plan, saying the US was studying the credit line proposal. He said US policy remained one of maximum economic pressure on Iran, but “it is up to the president at his discretion whether to dial the pressure up or down”.If the Macron plan won US support, Iran might be able sell at least 700,000 barrels of oil a day, more than double its current exports.The French president is trying to engineer a new stage-by-stage agreement that does not replace the 2015 nuclear deal but supplements it and has made intense efforts to draw Trump into his mediation efforts.Similar efforts were made by France before Trump pulled out of the deal in May 2018, but they failed to persuade the US president that the deal was salvageable.Macron has been warning the Iranians not to take fresh steps away from the deal, saying it would send the wrong signal.Rouhani claimed there was a conflict within the US on how to proceed. “Hardliners, neocons and racists in the US do not want the relationship between Iran and the US to be right – whenever we move forward, they spoil it,” he said. “The US exit from the nuclear deal was the result of this triangle of radicalism inside the White House.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ba778159d82834aa36202cc313e705a624e36c2/0_167_3331_2000/master/3331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=601814fbe5c23434a6a9a48df7f35207","title":"justin trudeau seeks to repeat 2015 surge as canada braces for election","story":"The prime minister is likely to call a vote for next month in which the environment, populism and Trump are all expected to featureWith the aura of his star power fading, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, and his governing Liberal party are aiming to extend their parliamentary majority for another four years.As summer winds down, all party leaders are effectively in campaign mode and the prime minister is expected to officially call the election in the coming days. Under current rules, opposition parties will have less than two months to shake the incumbent Liberals from government as they travel the country to woo voters.The election is predicted to be an acrimonious affair, say pollsters. And as Canadians prepare for the mudslinging, a number of issues are expected to dominate the campaign.A spring of intense flooding in eastern parts of the country and wildfires raging in the west has brought new urgency to Canada’s response to the climate crisis.In addition to a spate of natural disasters, Nanos credits a pitched battle in the country over carbon taxes for keeping the environment as a key electoral issue.Trudeau is likely to position himself as the leader best equipped to meet the country’s climate obligations, despite the government being far off track for its Paris accord commitments.While the rival Conservative party has been widely panned for its lack of substantial environmental policies, the prime minister has also received vigorous pushback from climate activists.In late June, the government declared a climate emergency in the country – and then approved a multibillion-dollar oil pipeline expansion the following day.“For the Trudeau government to approve this pipeline after declaring a climate emergency makes about as much sense as pouring gasoline on a burning fire,” said Greenpeace campaigner Mike Hudema.Amid rising tides of far-right populism in the US and Europe, the election will mark the first country-wide appearance of the People’s Party of Canada – a rightwing splinter party led by the former Conservative minister Maxime Bernier. Ever since its formation, the party has railed against immigration and Canada’s multiculturalism policies.Like many countries, Canada has witnessed a growing intolerance for immigrants and racial minorities among conservative-identified voters, although analysts are unsure how much support a far-right populist party can expect. Bernier’s low polling numbers have so far disqualified him from the two leader’s debates held in October.The country’s electoral system typically rewards parties that cater to the centre, said Tamara Small, a political science professor at University of Guelph, where the plurality of votes are up for grabs.But analysts also see intolerance and xenophobia becoming increasingly concentrated in parties on the right. This recent shift speaks to a hardening of political views across all parties, said Frank Graves, president of the political polling company Ekos Research.“We’re seeing radical polarization on issues like climate change and … immigration in general,” said Graves. “We’re talking about stuff we’ve never seen before.”The real beneficiaries of any populist wave could be the Green party, said Graves and Nanos.If an election was held in the coming days, he said, “the Greens are very close to the point where they could be the power-broker that kept to a minority government in play.”Recent electoral success in local and provincial elections has buoyed support for the party and polling also suggests that Elizabeth May, the Green leader – and most seasoned politician currently in federal politics – remains the most popular leader in the country.Much of the party’s appeal lies in its strong environmental stance, but also its position at the fringes of mainstream politics. Polling shows the Greens drawing support not just from disaffected Liberal voters, who feel the prime minister has not acted decisively on the environment, but also from the NDP – and even the Conservatives, said Graves.On Tuesday, 14 frustrated members of the NDP in the province of New Brunswick announced they would be leaving the party for the provincial and federal Greens.In the summer of 2015, Trudeau was polling a distant third before the autumn election. Seemingly out of nowhere, he surged ahead and secured a robust parliamentary majority.While surprises could – and probably will – pop up domestically, Nanos predicts a major disruption could come south of the border, from the US president.“Donald Trump will probably say something that could materially shape the outcome of the election. It could be on purpose. It could be by accident,” said Nanos.Trump has repeatedly broken with traditional taboos against commenting on foreign elections, weighing in on the UK Conservative leadership race and publicly supporting Benjamin Netanyahu’s re-election campaign as Israeli prime minister.Any barbs lobbed at Trudeau by the president could rally Canadians around the prime minister, said Nanos, and any endorsement of a Conservative candidate would probably be a “stake in the heart of the Conservative party”, he said.“Canadians are especially tuned into Donald Trump, whether they love or hate him because, realistically, Canada is hostage to geography.”The election is likely to be held on 21 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea87bd94bcfc1be930d51954c555e91558ae2d1e/0_0_4000_2399/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fd06540718f1c806a71469d1296161a","title":"hurricane dorian hammers the bahamas in pictures","story":"Images show the extent of flooding in cities including Nassau and Dorian this week"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Victim has been removed to Blanchardstown hospital in a serious condition, garda\u0026iacute said\u0026lsquoIf you have a gun\u0026hellip why would I think you are safe in the presence of young children?\u0026rsquoHugh McElvaney was interviewed by undercover reporter in 2015 RT\u0026Eacute programmeDrone-style vessel is used for gunnery training and may have drifted 5,500km across AtlanticIrish leader was famous for his obstructionist tactics at WestminsterPublic may be \u0026lsquounknowingly shielding a killer\u0026rsquo, warn garda\u0026iacuteEmployment in primary care falls, as number of posts in acute services up by 820Commission seeks update on Irish water management, infrastructure improvementsAffordable housing now people\u0026rsquos top priority for Government ahead of Brexit \u0026ndash surveyIrish language groups welcome move but Educate Together says parents\u0026rsquo choice will be \u0026lsquorestricted\u0026rsquoGovernment to challenge watchdog\u0026rsquos findings that card has no basis in lawConsortium tells Pelosi there is \u0026lsquogrowing sense of danger\u0026rsquo to peace from a hard BrexitJohnson suggests agri-food could continue to be regulated on an all-Ireland basis after BrexitAround 100 people attended rally against planned suspension of parliamentVaradkar accused of not being interested in listening to unionists over BrexitCouncil to adopt renewable energy, reduce carbon emissions and make city \u0026lsquoclimate resilient\u0026rsquoUS vice-president shares resort with wedding party, golfers and team-building conferenceUS vice-president chats with locals on walkabout of Doonbeg village before family dinner"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4007519.1567600528!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"mystery surrounds us naval boat washed up on aran island","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe US naval boat was found floating in the water by the Doolin Express on Monday. Photograph: Doolin Ferry CompanyFacebookA US drone-style military vessel has washed up off the coast of Inis Oírr, the smallest of the Aran Islands.The Silver Ships AM800 High Speed Maneuverable Surface Target is used by the US Navy for gunnery training and can be manned or unmanned.The vessel was discovered on Tuesday at 1.30pm by the crew of the Doolin ferry that sails between Doolin in Co Clare and the Aran Islands every day.The red boat was floating in the water upside down. The ferry towed the boat to shore and it is currently on the beach.How it got to Ireland is a bit of a mystery. The most likely explanation is that it came loose from its moorings at the huge naval base in Norfolk, Virginia, and was carried with the ocean currents 5,500 kilometres across the Atlantic.The vessel was made by Silver Ships, a company based in Mobile, Alabama. According to an employee, David Hunt, responding on the Doolin Ferries’ Facebook page, the vessel that washed up on Inis Oírr was built in 2015 and is the 90th of its type to be built.Doolin Ferries Company owner Liam O’Brien said the vessel showed signs of being in the water for a long time, perhaps several years.He said the presence of goose barnacles on the hull suggests it could be in the water for three years. “They take an awful long time to grow,” he said.“It looked like it was in good condition. On close inspection you can see there are a lot of bullet holes. It looks like there was an explosion on one side. It will cost a lot of money to repair.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4006976.1567545793!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord how mike pence shat on the new carpet in ireland s spare room","story":"US vice-president Mike Pence meets Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in Dublin amid controversy about his decision to stay in President Trump’s Doonbeg golf course during his visit to Ireland.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS vice president Mike Pence, Nancy Pence-Fritsch and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, An Taoiseach at Farmleigh House, where Mr Pence was  the service records of his grandfather, Richard Michael Cawley, who served with distinction in the  Defence Forces during the Civil War. Photograph: MaxwellThe hospitable hosts buttered up their important guest and made a big fuss of his family and hoped he would say nice things about them to the important people he would meet after his visit to Ireland.And he told them they were wonderful and that he loved them. He even said a special prayer for everyone and then, just before he left, he turned around and kicked them where it hurts.It came as a shock.Like pulling out all the stops for a much-anticipated visitor to your home and thinking it has been a great success until somebody discovers he shat on the new carpet in the spare room, the one you bought specially for him.US vice-president Mike Pence met President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Tuesday during an official visit. His Irish hosts, up to their oxters for the last three years in Brexit worry, hoped to impress upon him Ireland’s fears about the consequences of a no-deal Brexit for the country.He could, maybe, stick in a supportive word for us in his talks with Boris Johnson in London – his next port of call.Pence, after all, is Irish American and wastes no opportunity to go misty-eyed about his love for the “Old Country” as he lards on his Mother Machree schtick on both sides of the Atlantic. He couldn’t praise Ireland enough on Tuesday – “deeply humbled” and “honoured” to be going to the hometown of his mother’s grandmother and so on.Strong endorsementBut, after he said all these nice things about the “Emerald Isle” and how much his boss Donald Trump – he sent his best wishes, by the way – appreciates us and all we do to help American security in Shannon, he delivered a very strong endorsement of Boris Johnson and Brexit.No room left for doubt. As Pence read from the autocue and Irish eyes definitely stopped smiling, it was clear he was channeling His Master’s Voice. Trump is a fan of Brexit and of Boris.And this, after such a lovely morning, with Pence and his mother meeting the Taoiseach and his mother.His Irish mother, as Mike calls her. He dotes on Nancy. So he should have known that any Irish mammy will tell you if you can’t say anything good, say nothing at all.Instead, he veered off his rather gushing statement following his meeting with the Taoiseach into some crunching Brexit remarks about our duty to do right by Boris Johnson and the UK.As the air in the steamy ballroom turned decidedly frosty, Pence urged Ireland and the European Union “to negotiate in good faith” with the new British prime minister.The local crowd raised eyebrows and wondered what he thinks the aforementioned EU has been doing for the last three years, if not negotiating in good faith with the UK.Varadkar’s expression didn’t change. He stood on the platform beside the vice-president and hardly flinched, smiling politely.Even when Pence made it worse by not only mentioning “good faith” and “Boris Johnson” in the same context but by also requesting his hosts to have “respect for the UK’s sovereignty”, Varadkar maintained a stoic courtesy.He had to. It’s in the job description for normal prime ministers.Same goes for Higgins, even though it would be true to say that Michael D and Mike Pence do not sing from the same hymn sheet.But international diplomacy is what it is and in the context of going about their nations’ business, everyone has to be seen to get along.But for all that, Michael D’s sprayed-on smile when the US vice-president came to visit him in Áras an Uachtaráin was a joy to behold.The Áras was bedecked with flowers from the garden for the visit of the anti-gay-rights Pence. All the flowers were in shades of pink. The only other colour was lavender.Huge entouragePence arrived with a huge entourage. Higgins escorted him through the Áras and into the ballroom where he invited his guest to sign the visitors’ book. Michael D looked ahead a lot of the time. “Can I invite you to sign. . . ” he motioned towards the book.Pence sat at the table and began to write. The President stood to one side, saying nothing apart from the occasional whisper to his wife, Sabina. The VP kept writing as the silence got louder. Still writing. Michael D looking into the distance.Finally, thank God, Pence stopped writing, which was a relief all round. There was another photo opportunity then the party retired next door for tea. A picture was released of the two groups sitting on either side of a long table – two tables together.The sort of thing when more guests than expected arrive. “Quick, run out next door and ask Assumpta for the collapsible table they got in for Mossie’s wake. Your man from America is only after arriving with half of Indiana. Where’s the big tablecloth?”The talks between the President and the vice-president didn’t take long. Soon, they were waving goodbye from the portico. The dogs didn’t put in an appearance.He didn’t call the vice-president a “w*****r”, which is what he did when he had a row many years on radio with a famous American conservative commentator. Michael Graham was his name. Michael D might easily have become confused, because Mike Pence is an adherent of the “Graham rule”. This is where he doesn’t stay alone in a room with a woman who is not his wife so as not to give rise to bad thoughts and the like.Static courtesyAt Farmleigh House, Varadkar’s static courtesy was equally impressive. But then, the Taoiseach has dined before in Pence’s presence.“We are all God’s children,” Leo pointedly told him when they met for breakfast last March in Washington. Just to be clear, they met for breakfast in a roomful of other people. The two men weren’t dining alone, perish the thought.It was a very pleasant event. This was when Leo invited his American host to Ireland and told him to bring along his mother too. It would be a grand trip for her and, in an emergency, if Mike’s wife was otherwise detained, mammy could sit in as chaperone should the VP have found himself unavoidably alone in a dining room with our gay Taoiseach.You can never be too careful. In the end, Pence brought his wife, his mother and his sister to the Old Country, where it seems a lot of the natives have turned alarmingly heathen in the generations since his ancestors left our shores.His morning began with a trip to the Phoenix Park and a courtesy call on the President.To look at Mike Pence, with all smiles and handshakes, you’d hardly think he isn’t very keen on the gays at all.Brave Mike sat down to lunch with the Taoiseach and his partner Matthew and managed not to choke on his Dublin Bay prawns. The VP’s wife Karen, who recently took up a part-time teaching position in a school which bans LGBT pupils and staff, kept her fillets of venison down despite the company.The next prime minister the couple will meet on their trip will be the serial philander Boris Johnson. He’s pretty experienced on the extramarital and premarital sex front, which they abhor.On Tuesday, to be on the safe side, nobody was left alone with the US vice-president in case it might upset him.“We have both been blessed with Irish mothers,” Pence told the Taoiseach when they met the press. He didn’t say anything about Indian fathers (in Leo’s case) but there you go.“I carry Ireland with me wherever I go,” said Pence, speaking of an old Ireland, one his ancestors left generations ago.Still, his visit was a great example of ersity in action. President Trump, who recently visited, is very hands-on with women and likes to grab them in all sorts of places. And his second in command is the opposite. He won’t stay on his own with a woman who isn’t his wife."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4007540.1567598961!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"secret report undermines uk s backstop alternatives","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A sign on the Northern Irish side of the River Finn in Strabane: The Government and the European Commission have insisted that any proposals they have seen are either completely inadequate and insufficiently secure or technologically unproven. Photograph:   Dan KitwoodGetty ImagesThe campaign by Brexiteers and the British government against the Northern Ireland backstop has been sustained for up to two years with claims that they have a viable alternative that can do everything required of the backstop itself.It goes by the name of “alternative arrangements” and consists in a collection of technological and administrative fixes that would supposedly do away with the need for controls on the Border.The Government and the European Commission have insisted that any proposals they have seen are either completely inadequate and insufficiently secure or technologically unproven.The report, which is marked “official-sensitive” and has been prepared for the UK’s EU Exit Negotiations Board, is dated August.It looks at the challenges involved on the Border in a no-deal situation and summarises the work of multiple subcommittees and the NI Department of Agriculture Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) in assessing a variety of “alternative arrangements” (also referred to as “facilitations”) as a basis for preparation of a UK negotiating position.The report’s authors warn that it should not be released – “we and other departments have cautioned against this given the potential negative impacts on the renegotiation with the EU and we understand No 10 are in agreement . . . ”Not least, no doubt, because the report so clearly undermines public claims that the UK has in its negotiating back pocket a straightforward alternative to the backstop: “It is evident that every facilitation has concerns and issues related to them. The complexity of combining them into something more systemic and as part of one package is a key missing factor at present.”The “concerns” are technical capacity (much is beyond available technology), the administrative burden (particularly on small business), and political. \u0026nbspSmall businessesSmall businesses, for example, may simply not have the capability to share the required data and are likely to be most reluctant to share commercially sensitive data necessary for “smarter risking”, data-based\u0026nbsp calculations \u0026nbspof\u0026nbsp traders’ likely compliance to reduce the need to check them.And the creation of a common all-Ireland veterinary and phytosanitary zone (SPS), seen as among the most attractive, deliverable and negotiable options, raises “many of the challenges of the backstop” – “democratic accountability, eastwest implications , and implications for international trade”.The common SPS zone would require customs declarations on all cross-border goods and checks on the Irish Sea.The idea of using mobile SPS checks away from the Border was seen as “attracting very poor negotiability” and as the “most untenable facilitation”, impractical, and involving high security risks. And the report warns that as most food consignments are chilled or frozen, physical inspection would require unloading “to maintain the integrity of the cold chain, this would need to take place in a temperature controlled fixed facility.” All over the countryside?EU regulations mandate SPS inspections “at the point of entry”.Onboard vehicle technology which could track the location, weight and temperature of goods is also considered risky if a lorry might suddenly be taken out of service and goods offloaded into a non-registered vehicle.Physical goods checks through mobile units could take weeks and involve lengthy periods of quarantine, the report found. The units could also be vulnerable to “targeting” and staff could be at risk, the report said.Assessments of the potential of artificial intelligence and the internet of things, a new “border code” set of rules for all, and new industry-based regulatory approaches need further work, the report warns.Trusted traders“Trusted trader” schemes, widely touted as being capable of removing the necessity for checks on the bulk of regular trade, are seen as having potential but requiring elaborate administration.But even if adopted, the necessity of border checks on a minority of goods, and particularly of SPS controls, mean that border-based controls cannot simply be wished away – a challenge not just for the UK authorities, but for those in the South who have long insisted that the UK’s alternative arrangements are simply not practical or remotely ready for use.With little prospect of any viable UK backstop alternative emerging ahead of a UK election, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit looming larger, Dublin is understood to be quietly but intensively preparing for the inevitability of some form of hard border controls.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

With Google Play system updates, important Security and Privacy fixes can now be sent directly to your phone from Google Play, just the same way all your other apps update. So you get these fixes as soon as they are available.As part of the new update Google also introduced dark mode - a highly-anticipated feature among Android users in recent years.The new Dark theme is designed to take it easy on your eyes when using a smartphone in low-light conditions. Google claims it will also help prolong a device\u0027s battery life.Other new features in a sound amplifier to boost sound and filter out background noise, as well as gesture navigation to move between apps using swipes.This last feature means the back button, which has been a staple of\u0026nbspAndroid operating systems in recent years, has now been removed.Instead users will need to learn how to get around with a swipe and a pull. Google claims this new system is designed to be quicker and more intuitive, though it is already proving controversial among Android users.Finally, Android 10 comes with support for folding phones, meaning its interface can seamlessly transition between different screen shapes.Both Samsung and Huawei plan to release folding smartphones later this year in the form of the Galaxy Fold and the Mate X, though their launch has been delayed due to issues with the mechanism.Their delayed launch means they could come already shipped with the new operating system.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Analysts said there was little prospect of the industry recovering in the last quarter of 2019 and September’s data was likely to be even bleaker.The UK’s manufacturing output slumped to a seven-year low last month as the sector shrank at the fastest rate since 2012, the industry’s PMI showed on Monday.Economists will be closely watching Wednesday’s data for the services sector, which accounts for about 80 per cent of UK output and posted unexpected growth in July, for an indication as to the health of the wider British economy.A poor performance\u0026nbspfor August\u0026nbspwould raise serious questions about Britain’s ability to bounce back from an overall economic contraction in the second quarter of this year. A second contraction in the current quarter would signal a recession.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Set building begins on Waterloo Place in Edinburgh ahead of filming for Fast and Furious 9Members of the Royal Southern Yacht Club and the Island Sailing Club take part during the annual cricket match between the clubs, which takes place on the Bramble Bank sandbank in the middle of the Solent at low tideAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate at Whitehall in LondonOne of the iconic \u0027Girl with Balloon\u0027 artworks by anonymous street artist Banksy is carried near one of the original locations the artwork appeared at on the Southbank in LondonThe sun rises over the sculpture The Couple by artist Sean Henry, at Newbiggin-by-the-sea in NorthumberlandA person wearing a Boris Johnson \u0027head\u0027 digs a grave at the foot of a tombstone during a protest organised by Avaaz and Best for Britain, outside Downing Street in LondonNat Lofthouse statue is covered in flags at the University of Bolton Stadium, BoltonPerformers take part in Notting Hill Carnival.

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Sterling has tumbled almost 19 per cent since the EU referendum in June 2016.The government’s defeat by a margin of 328 to 301 on Tuesday leaves Mr Johnson’s Brexit strategy in tatters by potentially robbing him of the threat of no-deal, which he has repeatedly said is essential to obtain concessions from the EU.Responding from the despatch box immediately after the result, the prime minister said he would table a bill to trigger a general election, with a vote expected to take place soon after the anti-no deal bill completes its passage through the Commons on Wednesday.But Mr Johnson’s plans seemed doomed to failure after Labour said it would not back his election motion, which requires a two-thirds majority and is therefore dependent on opposition support to pass through the Commons, until the legislation to stop no-deal is passed.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They had one daughter together.Speaking to the New York Times while promoting\u0026nbspthe forthcoming sequel Terminator: Dark Fate, Hamilton said that the pair’s relationship “was a mystery to all of us – even Jim and myself – because we are terribly mismatched. I used to say we fit together like a puzzle.

She landed on her neck and the extent of her injuries saw production on the film shut down for eight weeks.It\u0027s been rumoured for decades that Ed Harris punched James Cameron in the face while filming the watery 1989 drama The Abyss, but here\u0027s reportedly why: Cameron failed to tell Harris that his oxygen tank would run out before cameras stopped rolling on a particular scene, leaving the actor gasping for air. At the time of filming Apocalypse Now in 1979, Martin Sheen was drinking heavily and using drugs - so much so that, unbeknownst to the crew or his director Francis Ford Coppola, he had a heart attack in the middle of the jungle. Sheen was forced to crawl for approximately half a mile before finding somebody who could treat him.Jackie Chan is famous for many things and performing his own stunts is one of them. This has left him with his fair share of injuries in the past, some of which came on the set of 1986 action comedy Armour of God. The actor, attempting to slide down a tree, fractured his skull after falling 25 feet and hitting his head on a rock. Chan was immediately rushed into surgery and, to this day, he has a hole in his skull that he covers with a plastic plug.Michael J Fox famously came close to dying on the set of Back to the Future Part III in 1990. It was during a scene in which his character, Marty McFly, is hanged by the neck - something the crew permitted Fox to act out himself on the condition that he knew exactly where to place his hand when the noose was around his neck. Fox miscalculated, choking himself before passing out and was cut down after someone realised the actor was close to death.637 The kids in The Brady BunchWhile filming a 1973 episode of The Brady Bunch titled The Cincinnati Kids, the child stars of the hit TV show reportedly almost got caught up in a horrendous incident. As they were about to shoot a scene riding a rollercoaster - fit with a camera mounted to the front of the carriage - Mike Brady actor Robert Reed insisted crew carry out a test run. It\u0027s a good job he did - when the rollercoaster was in motion, the camera came loose and flew into the position the kids\u0027 heads would been had they been on board.Breaking Bad star Aaron Paul cheated death while filming the first season of Breaking Bad in 2008. Having asked for permission to move positions for a scene, the actor was left shaken after a boulder fell off the roof of a nearby RV directly onto the spot where he had just been standing.

Stuntman Terry Walsh came to her rescue.In the words of Tom Cruise\u0027s Edge of Tomorrow co-star Emily Blunt, speaking on US chat show Conan, about a car chase scene the duo filmed in 2014: “I hear Tom under his breath as I approach the right-hand turn, going \u0027Brake, brake, brake. Oh God. Brake, brake, brake. Brake it hard.\u0027 I left it too late, and drove us into a tree. I almost killed Tom Cruise.”British actor John Hurt was under so much prosthetic playing Joseph Merick in David Lynch\u0027s 1980 historical drama The Elephant Man that he almost suffocated. He was told to remain upright while wearing the makeup and would continually forget, almost losing his life in the process.British action hero Jason Statham escaped death on the set of 2014 action sequel The Expendables 3 after the brakes on a truck he was driving stopped working. He had no choice but to jump from the moving three-tonne vehicle seconds before it went into the Black Sea.Daniel Day-Lewis went into full method actor mode for his role as Buffalo Bill in Martin Scorsese\u0027s 2002 period drama Gangs of New York - so much so that he contracted pneumonia after refusing to wear clothes that didn\u0027t exist in the 19th century. In fact, he was so dedicated to the role that he reportedly refused medicine that didn\u0027t exist at the time of his character, but acquiesced when he was told by medics he could die if he didn\u0027t. Bob Denver, who played the titular Gilligan on 1960s TV series Gilligan’s Island, found himself in mortal danger after getting trapped inside a hut with a lion that pounced on him. In a lucky twist of fate, his mauling was prevented when the bed the lion was perched on broke, distracting the creature and leaving enough time for the lion\u0027s trainer to tackle it to the ground.Kristen Chenoweth was cast in legal TV drama The Good Wife for its fourth season in 2013, but on her first day on set, a light fixture fell and hit her in the face.

Chenoweth decided not to return to the show save for a cameo appearance in a later episode.Lorenza Izzo almost drowned while filming an escape attempt scene on the set of Eli Roth\u0027s 2013 horror film The Green Inferno.

Roth reportedly used some of this footage in the finished film.Oscar-winning star Jennifer Lawrence was required to run through a tunnel on the set of 2012 young-adult novel adaptation The Hunger Games. However, a malfunction with a fog machine saw the enclosed area fill with so much smoke that Lawrence had to escape and came dangerously close to suffocating.Performing his own stunts as usual, Tom Cruise found himself in trouble on the set of 2003 film The Last Samurai when a mechanical horse he was required to jump on malfunctioned, leaving a blade held by his co-star Hiroyuki Sanada inches away from his neck.

Fortunately, it left him with mere bruises.While filming the last ever episode of Lost in 2010, Matthew Fox - who played Jack Shephard - was almost stabbed by a knife after a retractable one was replaced by a real one. The plan was to use the real knife for a fight sequence, right up until the moment of penetration as a collapsible one looked too fake. Somehow, the knives weren\u0027t swapped and Fox was saved by protective padding he\u0027d put on at the very last minute.Dylan O\u0027Brien nearly met his maker on the set of Maze Runner: The Death Cure. During a stunt that required him to jump from the top of one car to another, the actor was dragged under the vehicle and suffered lacerations and fractures to his cheekbones and orbital sockets. His injuries were so serious that the film was delayed for an entire year and was eventually released in 2018.Brendan Fraser nearly died on the set of The Mummy in 1999 due to an incident that saw a hanging scene go terribly wrong.

I was lit up like a Christmas tree, said Caviezel, who also dislocated his shoulder on set.As well as suffering a nasty injury on the set of Kill Bil Vol 2 due to a car malfunctioning, Uma Thurman had a near miss in a separate incident - also involving a car - while filming 2010 fantasy film Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief. After a crew member forgot to apply the brakes to an unmanned van, the vehicle started rolling towards Thurman, who was completely unaware. Thankfully, her co-star Pierce Brosnan spotted it and jumped into the vehicle, slamming the brakes before it hit her. Those 007 skills certainly came in handy.As ever, Jackie Chan performed his own stunts for the first of his popular Hong King action series Police Story (1985). However, the climactic scene in the mall saw him crack two vertebrae, dislocate his pelvis and burn his hands in one moment that required him to slide down a pole from a large height.While filming high-octane thriller Premium Rush (2012), Joseph Gordon-Levitt collided with a taxi, leaving him in need of more than 30 stitches.

He required 150 stitches.While filming the Red Dwarf episode Backwards in 1989, Craig Charles shot a scene that saw him walk out of a lake in reverse. Terrifyingly, the actor - who had weights in his pockets to stop him from floating - got his foot stuck and was held underwater until a rescue team saw him struggling.Sylvester Stallone has had many close shaves throughout his career, but the most life-threatening came while filming 1985 sequel Rocky IV. He asked his co-star Dolph Lundgren to knock him out and the resulting punch was so heavy that Stallone\u0027s rib cage was pushed into his chest, causing his heart to be compressed due to the swelling of his pericardial sac. He spent nine days in intensive care.  George Clooney\u0027s character was getting beaten up for a scene in 2005 drama Syriana when the actor ended up with an injury that bruised his brain.

He confirmed that Labour would back an early election under any circumstances if Boris Johnson were to call one.\u0026nbspWithin hours, the sounds of gears being thrown into reverse could be heard in Westminster. Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, a lawyer who understands small print, realised there was a danger of the Labour Party walking into a trap designed by the prime minister.\u0026nbspThen after Tuesday night’s vote, when Johnson indicated he would call for an early election, Corbyn told him: “Get the bill through first in order to take no-deal off the table.”The Labour leader knows that a vote of parliament for an early election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act leaves the date of the election under the control of the prime minister.\u0026nbspIf the Commons votes for Hilary Benn’s bill to block a no-deal Brexit on Wednesday night, Johnson is set to ask MPs to vote for an early election immediately afterwards. He will say that he intends to hold the election on 15 October, but the Act merely requires MPs to vote, by a two-thirds majority, for a motion saying: “That there shall be an early parliamentary general election.”If they vote for it, it is then up to the prime minister to advise the Queen on the date of the election. It would be extraordinary for Johnson to go back on his word in parliament, but there would be nothing to stop him naming a different date. He could, for example, ask Her Majesty to issue a proclamation for an election on 7 November.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Protesters take to streets after Boris Johnson suspends Parliament  Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.Anti Brexit protesters march on WhitehallMany of the protesters carried placardsThe protesters also marched to Trafalgar Square, where they blocked trafficJohn McDonnell addressed crowds in Whitehall.A small group of Brexit supporters attempted to stage a counter protest in central London.Three people were arrested in London, including a woman who sat on the road near Trafalgar Square.In Oxford, locals and students gathered outside Balliol College, Boris Johnson\u0027s alma mater, to protest.Thousands of people gather in central Glasgow to protest against the prime minister.Jeremy Corbyn spoke to protesters in central Glasgow.That would mean there would be no parliament sitting on Brexit day, 31 October, which would mean that the UK would leave the EU without a deal by automatic operation of EU law.\u0026nbspSo Labour MPs have been lobbying their leader to refuse to support the prime minister’s motion for an early election, and different Labour spokespeople have been saying different things about the party’s position.\u0026nbspTwo Labour MPs, Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, have written for The Independent explaining why they are opposed to an early election: they say that Brexit must be decided first.\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn hoping to block no-deal Brexit and trigger electionHow Jeremy Corbyn handles this week will be his legacySharon Osbourne lashes out at Jeremy Corbyn in violent, scathing rantJohnson is pushing anti-Brexit liberals into the embrace of CorbynBut I understand that Corbyn’s close advisers argued that Labour cannot afford to be seen as shying away from an election.

He gave two reasons: one was the danger of the election date being set after 31 October the other was that Labour would lose, making a no-deal Brexit more likely.\u0026nbspIf the shadow cabinet did urge Labour MPs to vote against an early election on Wednesday night, Johnson would not have a two-thirds majority. He may then try to pass an act amending the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, setting the 15 October date in law, which would need a simple majority to pass.\u0026nbspIf Labour MPs still refuse\u0026nbspto vote for it, they will be accused of being afraid of losing, because there would certainly be time to stop a no-deal Brexit after the election – if Corbyn won it. And the government might even win the vote with the help of the Scottish National Party, which thinks it can win back a lot of the seats it lost two years ago.\u0026nbspMuch more high politics ahead.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Total sales were flat, despite the summer’s BBQ-friendly\u0026nbspweather providing a small boost to food purchases, according to the British Retail Consortium-KPMG sales monitor.“August proved to be yet another incredibly disappointing month for retail,” said Paul Martin, KPMG’s UK head of retail. “With a budgetary spending review, the Brexit crunch point looming and potentially a general election on the cards, it’s clear that the only thing that is certain in the coming months is further uncertainty.”The British Retail Consortium warned the UK high street was likely to suffer further store closures and job losses and called on the chancellor\u0026nbspto “fix the broken business-rates system”,\u0026nbspwhich firms have warned stacks\u0026nbspthe odds in\u0026nbspfavour of\u0026nbsponline shopping companies.Signs of a wilting economy also raise the stakes for Boris Johnson, who is preparing to face off against MPs seeking to block a no-deal Brexit this week and has indicated he could call a snap election.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

A reading below 50 indicates contraction, while higher than 50 shows growth.Duncan Brock, group director at the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, said the sector had “clung on by its fingertips this month” as overseas clients “abandoned spending in favour of a wait-and-see approach and the political environment became increasingly murky”.He added: “There’s only so much companies can do to absorb costs before UK consumers notice the impact to their wallets, and only so much Brexit indecision the sector can take before it is tipped into contraction.”Recession fears grow as construction firms and retailers sufferBusiness confidence about the next 12 months in the service sector dropped in August to its lowest point since July 2016, the month after the\u0026nbspreferendum on membership of the European Union\u0026nbsp(EU).Similar surveys earlier this week showed the UK’s manufacturing sector was suffering its worst downturn for seven years and the construction industry had shrunk for the fourth month in a row.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He added: “The PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Hubert Minnis, the prime minister, urged Bahamians to show love to come through the ordeal suffered by their country, while aerial video recorded over the Bahamas’ Great Abaco Island showed mile upon mile of flooded neighbourhoods and smashed buildings.In the US, meanwhile, authorities in Florida, Georgia and the Carolinas were on high alert, as they watched for indications the storm may make landfall in their states.\u0026nbspEarly on Tuesday, Dorian was downgraded by a single notch to a category 2 storm, with sustained maximum winds of 125mph. At the same time, the size the hurricane covered increased, as did the speed at which it was moving.“The headline for this #Dorian advisory is NOT that the wind speed has slightly decreased,” the National Hurricane Centre said of an update\u0026nbspit issued on Twitter. “The combined wind, surge, and floods hazards are the same or even worse since the hurricane has become larger.”Created with Sketch.Huge damage as record Hurricane Dorian hits Bahamas: In pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A road is flooded during the passing of Hurricane Dorian in Freeport, Grand Bahama.Hurricane Dorian\u0027s eye taken by Nasa astronaut Nick Hague, from aboard the International Space Station.

A total of nine counties issued mandatory evacuation orders, including\u0026nbspDuval County, which includes Jacksonville, one of Florida’s two biggest cities, and some areas in Palm Beach County, home to President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.The governors of Georgia and South Carolina also ordered evacuations of some coastal counties. Forecasts suggested the storm will move northwards, hugging the coast of Georgia and potentially making landfall in either North or South Carolina by the end of Thursday. Late on Tuesday, North Carolina governor Roy Cooper also announced evacuations for his coastal residents, while recognising the inconvenience. “When you weigh the cost of losing lives, this is something you need to do,” he told CNN.He added: “These impacts, including flooding, structural damage, storm surge and serious beach erosion in our coastal communities cannot be understated.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s a Nile crocodile, one of  crocs kept by Andy Johnson, , in a large converted shed on his farm in Cambridgeshire.“Cuddles isn’t that cuddly. She took my fingers a few weeks ago,” he says.“Her tooth went straight through my thumb nail and she took a chunk out of this finger. If she’d bitten my wrist, she’d have had my hand clean off.”I warily eye Cuddles, as she devours half a chicken carcass.“You mustn’t get nervous. You wouldn’t ask Lewis Hamiltonhe got nervous,” Andy says, before swtly telling me how long it would take Cuddles to kill me.“She could split you in two. She’d just grab you in the middle and then go into a roll and throw a bit of you each way.  Swallow one bit, and come back for the other half.”He insists, however, that Romeo, Cuddles’ brother, is a big softie. “He loves the back of his leg being tickled. He can’t reach that bit. It keeps him calm,” Andy explains.“All the skin around their belly and legs is soft. And obviously they are cold, which is a real shock at first, especiallyyou’ve worked with warm blooded animals all your le.”Andy is a fourth-generation farmer, which is why he first got into crocodiles.He used to produce a lot quail, used to feed birds of prey, and there’s a rule stating you need to be able to destroy any birds that get ill and need to be killed.Most farmers use an incinerator - but not Andy.“We decided to use a crocodile instead,” he says, revealing he bought one from a Belgian dealer.Andy won’t go into specics, but crocs y in cost from £ to £, depending on rarity.He became fascinated by the animals after seeing them on holiday, aged , in Florida, USA, with his now we Tracey.He says they are remarkably easy to look after and – crucially – surprisingly cheap, because they eat very little.“Romeo can go  months without eating. They are % efficient. They won’t eat at all for six months in the winter,” he explained.“These eat kg at a time, but only six or seven times a year.”The main cost is heating their shed, which includes a pond in the reptiles use to cool off.The crocodiles have become quite the local celebs, too.Andy would never charge anyone to see them, but people can get a glimpse of them when they pop into the farm shop, Johsons of Old Hurst.Of course, not everyone is so enamoured by the animals – he’s had complaints from neighbours.“But that’s the British nature – in Britain they always want to knock somebody doing something successful or doing something dferent,” he says.Make no mistake: a serval cat, native to sub-Saharan Africa is no ordinary, domestic feline – for one thing they eat whole rabbits and chicks rather than cans of Whiskas.Seb’s serval cat Anubis munches the chicks, which are dubbed “penny sweets”, even though they’re considerably more expensive at £ a pop.“The most nutritional and natural food you can feed him is whole prey – eyes, brains, heart, lungs, blood, organs, bones and fur are packed with nutrients and natural proteins that these cats bodies need,” Seb explained on Instagram.Anubis’ food bill comes to £ a week.Seb and Kelly bought Anubis in , and he lives with the couple and their two children, Sienna, six, and Brandon, , at their house in Oldham, Manchester.Seb is particularly proud of the cat and has even set him up an Instagram, which proudly declares he is “The Brad Pitt of the cat world”.The doting cat dad even has a tattoo of Anubis, proudly baring his fangs, on his hand.“We love sharing his le online. The general reaction when people spot Anubis via his social media account is shock,” Kelly previously said.Anubis is about five foot high when he stands on his back legs, and servals are classed as dangerous. They have been known to attack humans – but Seb and Kelly have no worries about Anubis.“Their large size and leopard like markings scream danger to the uneducated,” says Seb. “But once you overcome the shock factor of this beautul animal you realise its docile in nature. Hes very laid back, almost dog like, very comfortable in the presence of children, slow and careful with his movements.”That said the family never leave him alone with their kids, with the cat spending a lot of his time in a large enclosure in the garden.“I am known as the mad zebra lady,” says Terri Hill, , proudly.The first two zebras she got came from Dublin Zoo, who needed to rehome them after they attacked a rhino.“They were disruptive,” Terri explains.Bailey and Murphy were volatile, apparently a trait when it comes to zebras.“They all have an aggressive streak,” she says. “People think they are really pretty, and they are -I had a pound for every time someone said, ‘Aww, they’re like a stripy pony’ I’d be very wealthy.“But they are very aggressive. Their fight or flight instinct is huge.”Most of the time the pair are in a two-acre paddock surrounded by an -foot-high fence next to Terri’s house near Bristol.The Dangerous Wild Animal licence states fences have to be at least six foot, but Terri knew that wouldn’t be enough.“I’ve had one zebra be startled by something and run and hit the fence at -foot,” she said.Another ran full force into a telephone pole which was concreted into the ground and moved in four inches.“If a zebra was to kick me, it’d probably break my leg,” she says.“If I was to corner a zebra and they decided to fight, they fight until they think you’re dead. They kick so hard and their bites are some of the toughest bites in the zoo. They are really tough cookies.”Considering how aggressive they can be, why did she agree to look after Bailey and Murphy nine years ago and then take on two more, Tori and Kelsie Terri has always been fascinated by them, specically how dferent they are to horses.She runs a livery yard, where people who own horses but no land, keep their animals, and she’s done a lot of research into zebras.So much so she now advises zoos on zebra genetics and breeding.Her main advice is that keeping wild animals isn’t a decision to take lightly.Before getting Bailey and Murphy,Terri spent a long time attending workshops and talks put on by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums. She’s also stumped up £, for fencing and stables.Her “long-suffering” partner Drew, an ex fire-fighter is fine with the zebras, and the couple also have have Somali wild ass, and Nene, which are Hawaiaan geese.She has no interest in showing off her zebras to the public, or making any money out of them but says the cost and hassle is well worth it.“I can seem them out of kitchen and office window,” she says. “And I just love looking at them. I love looking at their stripe patterns, their movements.”Just don’t let them loose with a rhino.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And guess what has been highlighted by charity experts as the main cause “Excessive social media use.”Anyone surprised by that either  Thought not.Of course, not all children are unhappy. But parents should take this news as a serious warning shot. Because when it comes to our children’s happiness, the trend is clearly going in the wrong direction.With social media, the problem is partly one of expectations.Most grown-ups are seasoned enough to take the inevitable “my perfect le” posts on Instagram with a pinch of salt.Butyou are new to these things, being bombarded with images on your mate’s Instagram page of the le you are “meant” to be living could make even the most secure children begin to feel inadequate.The other problem is that it’s always “on” — and so are our kids. It used to be that children could shut the front door on a day of school and leave it on the outside until morning. Now, though, there is -hour access.Another news story this week revealed that nine out of ten teens aren’t getting enough sleep or exercise. It doesn’t take a genius to link the two issues.Social media — and reality TV — also reveal a new emphasis on appearance that has changed so much in the past  years, for adults as well as children. It’s just that children are more susceptible to that pressure.Other things have changed too — not least our approach to parenting . We are much more child-focused, which isn’t a bad thing necessarily.But telling our kids they are the best, no matter what they do, risks them thinking they are the best without doing anything at all to be so.Yes, we can help boost our children’s self-esteem. But what we should really do is help them boost their own self-esteem by doing things that make them feel good about themselves.Obviously, more families now have two parents in the workplace. That is a good thing but perhaps some working parents feel the need to compensate for their absence in ways — such as too many screens and “treats” — that aren’t necessarily brilliant for their children’s mental health.I write as a mother of two who worked more or less throughout my children’s young lives.I’m proud to say we all made it through in one piece.Obviously, I am no parenting expert. And I’m not claiming to have the answer to the world’s ills.But over the years, I’ve identied three golden rules I believe build a foundation for happy kids.The first is sport. I passionately believe that being part of a team, having regular exercise, being out and about and maintaining a routine offers kids stability and boundaries.It helps children feel good about their bodies and their abilities, boosting their self-esteem.The second is friendship. I am talking about proper friendship — not Facebook “friends” you never meet. When kids leave their phones at home and develop real friendships, they find people they can talk to and have fun with.Never underestimate the importance of fun. The third golden rule is probably the most important. Keep talking.There are too many tragic examples recently of young people who felt it necessary to take their own lives. I believe a problem shared is a problem halved. No matter how bad something is, talking always helps.I don’t remember ever reading about suicide when I was younger — especially not suicide in young people. Now it is the biggest cause of death among people aged  to  and it affects three times more men than women. That is a scary statistic.The causes are complicated but we need to keep channels of communication open with our kids. That way,they are unhappy, we will know about it. Andwe know about it, we at least have the potential to help.Remember Alfie Patten  For a while, in , he was known as the nation’s youngest father at the age of just .Then he found out, later that year, that it was another boy who had made his -year-old girlfriend pregnant. So Alfie was off the hook.That should have left him with the feeling that he had dodged a bullet.It could have spurred him on towards getting a good education and a job, to building himself a future.The adults in his le should have encouraged him to do just that.Instead, this week he turned up at Lewes Crown Court to be sentenced after being convicted of criminal damage.The court heard he is now a jobless alcoholic who lives at home with his mother and has a history of criminal offences.He already had a -month suspended prison sentence hanging over his head after being convicted on June  of shoplting, theft and possession of an imitation firearm.This is a good reminder that suspended sentences do not work. Alfie Patten clearly needs a bigger wake-up call than a suspended sentence or he risks ending up dead from alcohol and drugs.I saw a bench in my local park the other day that said: “Die with memories . . .  not dreams.”So true. But this guy, who is creating all the wrong sorts of memories, is a nightmare.Well, I don’t know about you but I am filled with relief that the heatwave – and even summer – is over.The cooler weather is perfect timing for going back to school and back to work, so we can all concentrate again. Hot weather is great when you are lying around in swimwear next to a pool . . .  notyou are sitting in a classroom or office.I  loved the photos of Dame Joan Collins, , lined up with the other stars of the Charlotte Tilbury makeup campaign.What a lady. Joan, is classy, funny and damn stylish. Or as my nan would’ve said, well turned out.Another day, another story about taxpayers’ money being wasted in foreign aid.This week it emerged that classrooms in nearly  schools in Pakistan – paid for by us – have been closed because they were badly built and unsafe.The buildings were erected as part of a £million aid project and their closure has left , children taking lessons outdoors or in overcrowded rooms.So, presumably, back where they were in the first place. On the upside, this has prompted some MPs to call for an inquiry about how our annual foreign aid budget – around £billion – is spent.On the downside, this is an example of yet more foreign aid money that has fallen into the wrong hands and ended up being wasted.In the meantime, British schools are crying out for investment.So why are we spending money on Pakistani schools and not our own Meanwhile, in the UK, overseas patients have left the NHS with more than £million in unpaid bills for treatment, it emerged this week. That cash could pay for , nurses, , heart bypasses or nearly , junior doctors.Two London hospitals are owed £million each, including almost £, from one patient alone.Apparently staff are reluctant to chase payments, with doctors’ leaders saying their obligation to charge overseas patients is “racist” and deters vulnerable groups from seeking help.To me, that sounds completely bonkers.I don’t understand why you are not asked to produce your NHS number – we all have one – when you get to hospital.Every other country asks, so why not us It’s a national service, not an international one.Former Big Brother contestant Kate Lawler is campaigning to remove the taboo facing women who don’t want children.She said she considers her two dogs, Baxter and Shirley, as her family and she’s very content with that.She’s right, of course. Whether or not you want children comes down to personal choice and it should be fine for women not to want them.I think the most important thing when choosing whether or not to have kids with someone is the pair of you both being on the same page. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The message is clear: Useful work is no longer done here.If Remainer MPs block Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan this week, we should place similar signs around the Palace of Westminster.Parliamentarians will have turned the place into a toxic waste ground which no longer fulfils a decent .It will have become an eyesore, a municipal liability, an assembly which no longer represents its voters and has become a poisonous threat to them.

Until now.Sometimes you will hear the Commons derided as a talking-shop but that, correctly, is what it is. Talking can prevent violence.There is a reason modern heads of government are not, by and large, stabbed in their beds like poor King Duncan in Shakespeare’s Macbeth.That reason has been the parliamentary process and the comforting knowledge that when push came to shove, parliamentarians would be on our side.Our side, please note. Not on the side of rival countries.There developed a quiet understanding that on issues of conscience , MPs need not slavishly follow their constituents. They were not quite delegates.But as representatives, they would be expected to follow broadly the sympathies of their electors and the policies of their parties. Otherwise they could just lie at election time then do the opposite once they had won their seats in the Commons.In his address outside  Downing Street last night, Boris left people in no doubt of his intentions to see us out of the EU after October .But when MPsto the Commons this afternoon, you will hear Remainers complain that “Parliament has been bypassed” in the Brexit process. This is tommyrot.As can happen in modern politics, it is the very opposite of the truth. I’m afraid they’re lying. They are ignoring you — the electorate — and they think you are too busyto notice.The EU referendum in  was set up by the Commons.The Commons approved the Article  process under which we told Brussels we were off. All well and good.David Cameron would not have won the  election had he not promised a referendum.Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn would not have attracted millions of votes in the  election had they not promised to respect the Leave result.But now that our departure is imminent, Remainer extremists such as Hammond, Bercow, Gauke, Grieve, Soubryplan to try to stop it.They have already bent the rules doing so and will possibly do so again today.Please, guys: Spare us any bleating about “constitutional outrages” by Boris. Your behaviour has been far worse.These swivel-eyed Europhiles have decided that the Leave vote of  — the biggest exercise in British electoral history — must be neutralised.The plebs got it wrong. Computer does not recognise. Reboot time. All past data has been lost.Just look at that warped figure Tony Blair, who treated Parliament with open contempt when he was PM.Yesterday he was throwing up his soft hands in horror at the idea of a new General Election to break the Westminster deadlock. He opposes an election because he knows it could result in a big win for an on-fire Boris. All this from the same Tony Blair whose regime helped kill hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in the name of, er, democracy.Instead, Blair wants a second referendum, whose wording would be decidedby the current, pro-EU, electorate-defying Parliament.We used to laugh at communist assemblies in countries such as North Korea, which were stuffed full of identikit dummies.We mocked minnows such as Ireland, which were forced by Brussels to re-run referendums that produced “wrong” results.We thought our democracy was more authentic because Parliament was connected to its constituents and because our politicians accepted the electorate’s verdict.We won’t be able to make such boastsWestminster’s Remainers have their way.What is the point of a parliamentit ignores the electorate  None. Many of these Remainer MPs seem readier to take their cue from Twitter users than from their own voters. It’s weird and it is not democracy.If our Parliament ceases to have a point, so do its buildingsand so do its members’ privileges .The very nation state becomes questionable, for what is the point of a state without a democratic Parliament Before long you find yourself asking what is the point of Western Europe, Nato and the whole web of Western values that separate us from Putin’s Russia and other hostile powers.Such is the importance of the decisions facing our MPs this week.

I had a premonition that night that something was going happen.They headed down to a busy bar where after knocking back the beers, one of his pals was knocked back by a barman walking past. A brawl erupted and David says the bouncer was bottled in the eye by his mate, who angrily kicked out at him instead.All I wanted to do was get up off the floor, but every time I did I got about  kicks in the face, he says.I thoughtI keep trying Im going to die. Id done nothing to him hed kicked the wrong guy.David was hauled to court, and after two days was charged with grievous bodily harm.Worse still, while the rest of his group had escaped arrest and flown back to the UK, he found himself living for months awaiting trial in Mallorcas Palma jail, which was stuffed with the doorman’s angry mates.Locked into the prison’s barbers one day, he was sucker-punched by a raging lag.“I feared for my le,” he says. “You have these little punch ups and think this its how its going to be. Im never going to snitch.“I shared cells with murderers. One Spanish guy had chopped his brother up and put him in a freezer. Im watching telly and hes on it, and Im in a cell with the guy.”Le took a darker turn still when one day, visiting his mate in a cell, David found him swinging from the ceiling and blue-faced, having hanged himself to death.The tragedy and thought of missing his son growing up was taking its toll on David, but after six months he received a glimmer of hope.“My friend confessed to my dad, broke down in tears and said ‘I was the one who did it, not Dave’,” he says. The pal then flew out to Spain to be picked out in a fresh line-up by the bouncer.But the nightmare was just beginning as the doorman pointed at David. Threatened with paying £, in damages or spending  years in prison, he says the bouncer was fearful of changing his story and even drove his pal out of the country by threatening his le.“I can see why he fled, but I was left in the sh*t. I spoke to him on the phone and saidI get the main court, will you say it was you  He said ‘Im never coming back’.”David’s le was thrown into crisis. He lost his job while his dad was forced to take out a bank loan and “sell pretty much everything he’d got” to fork up the £, so his son could take a shorter sentence.“Youre pushed into saying that youre guilty,” he says. “They pushed me because youre offered more yearsyou dont.”Having raised the money, he pushed to serve the rest of his sentence in England. He spent two months in a Madrid jail before transferred to Wandsworth and Peterborough prison - finally let out after a gruelling three years.His pal eventually paid his father back £,, but the scars may never heal.He says: “Ive got a message for the doorman: you got the wrong guy and totally ruined my le. I dont knowI could ever forgive you.” David’s ordeal isn’t the only drinking disaster in the episode – as Nick Bass gets into trouble for too much clowning around.After a hundred-shot beer challenge, the Sheffield lad found himself cuffed Down Under when he ran riot through a circus, trying to ride an elephant and stealing a £, clown costume.Meanwhile, when Kai Sing, , from Warwick overstayed his visa in China, he feared an impromptu drug test would see him locked up for le.Slammed in a bedless cell and threatened by shank-weilding inmates, his incarceration was instead a rare insight into the country’s bizarre propaganda and ingenious ways of fooling the British embassy.Earlier this year, we revealed how Magaluf ‘mafia’ gangs are targeting ‘up to  drunk tourists a night’ with ‘bearhug’ robberies in a fresh crime wave.Young, Dumb and Banged Up in the Sun airs on Star at pmOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Do not serve this man”, and together the pair handed them out to all his local takeaways and asked the owners not to let him in.At the time, single Dibsy was miserable. He couldn’t get a job and had to wear specially made clothes.Now, ten months on, he has lost nearly half his body weight, passed his driving test and got a girlfriend.He has given up fizzy drinks and booze and swapped takeaways for a calorie-controlled diet and exercise.He is down to , calories a day and is burning , of those with his fitness regime.His gruelling training schedule comprises three gym sessions a day.And it has paid off. At st lb, he is close to his target weight of st.Exhausted Dibsy, recovering in Mike’s gym after a training session, said: “If someone told me last year I would be entering the Great North Run I would have thought they were crackers.“I was at death’s door because of my lestyle. I was a million miles away from doing a half-marathon.“But I have got to the starting line thanks to hard work, determination and the support of an incredible group of people.“Obesity is a major problem in the UK but I am living proof that it can be beaten. If I can do it, then anyone can.”The UK is the third fattest nation in Europe, according to the World Health Organisation, with more than a quarter of the population officially obese.And the North East, where Dibsy lives, is one of the fattest regions in the country.He has struggled with his weight all his le, and the death of his father from cancer when he was  only worsened his comfort-eating.His huge bulk had a devastating effect on his le.He couldn’t get a job, visits to the cinema were out because the seats were too small for him and he had to book two seats whenever he travelled by train or plane.He couldn’t even wear a watch because no strap was big enough for his wrist.Dibsy knew he had to act after a heart scare landed him in hospital last year. A doctor told him he would die unless he changed his lestyle.It was just after that when he visited Mike’s diner with his mum.Married dad-of-three Mike began putting him through his paces at his Mas Body Gym in their home town of Middlesbrough and provided all his meals from his healthy eating diner.Dibsy said: “I am much more confident now. Physically I am in a better state than I have been for years.“Mentally I am the best I’ve ever been in my le.“There are so many things I can do for the first time that other people take for granted.“I have never been able to drive because I couldn’t fit behind a steering wheel.“But I have now passed my test, which has given me an incredible amount of freedom.“I love heading to the beach for a walk with my labrador Rosie. And I can take my mum for trips out now. For the first time ever I have been able to buy clothes off the peg.“I went to a sports shop to buy some tracksuits and I was like a kid in a toy shop.”Among all the developments in his le, the one that has put the biggest smile on his face is a new romance.He is coy about naming this love interest, as they have only been dating for a couple of weeks, but he said: “It’s lovely just to have someone to share this journey that I’m on.“She messaged me when I started losing weight and has kept in touch and it has grown from there.“We talk every day and she really supports me. It’s great on an evening when I have finished my gym for the day just to have someone to spend time with and share a bit of banter with.”Dibsy has been disciplined with his fitness and diet routine but he did nearly fall off the wagon once.He said: “On a Saturday night a few months ago I was at home and bored.“I was looking through Facebook and everyone seemed to be having a takeaway and a few beers.“I put a message up saying I was struggling and was thinking of having a takeaway myself.“Someone alerted Mike, who was at a family party, and within  minutes he had phoned me and said he was coming round.“We went out for a walk and he talked to me about what we were trying to achieve.“Then he took me to the hospital, where you can get weighed, and he showed me how much weight I had lost.“He said, ‘That’s why we are doing this’. I was so pleased the next day that I hadn’t given in to temptation.“I can’t put in to words how grateful I am to Mike for everything he’s done.”Ahead of the Great North Run Dibsy has completed the challenge of climbing the ,ft Ben Nevis, in Scotland.Mike, , said: “One of the big issues in his past is his dad dying. So to inspire him I thought about what is the closest he can get to his dad.“Well, you can’t get closer to heaven in the UK than the highest mountain, so we climbed that.“It took us three and a half hours to get up there.“Dibsy scattered some of his dad’s ashes and it was a lovely moment.“On the way home someone said, ‘What’s next ’. Dibsy’s journey began in the North East so I thought it would be a good idea to finish here, and there is no bigger local event than the Great North Run.”Dibsy and Mike managed to get last-minute entries thanks to local charity Boro Walkers. Dibsy said: “I don’t know how much I will be able to run and how much I will have to walk, but I will do it.“Being cheered on by that wonderful crowd will be a fantastic experience.”Many along the route will recognise Dibsy, whose profile has soared since he began dieting.He has appeared on TV’s This Morning and won the backing of hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby.The celeb pair pledged to contribute to the £, he needs for an operation to remove st of excess skin once he hits st.He is not eligible for the surgery on the NHS as he embarked on his weight loss programme privately.After the op, Dibsy will be getting a job for the first time in his le. Mike said: “He will work in my diner serving other people who need to lose weight.“He will be a living, breathing example of what can be achieved with a good fitness routine and sensible diet. He will be an inspiration.”Dibsy has already become a mentor for others. He said: “I get messages every day from people all over the world. It is often a case of, ‘I can’t do it, I have tried and tried and I just can’t lose weight’.“I answer every one of them and tell them I am living proof that it can be done.“The most important thing is to not leave it too late. I used up nearly every one of my nine lives and put my family through hell.“My mum used to lie awake at night to check I was breathing.“The most important thing is to start as soon as possible.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitment to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a dferent choice.”It was a similar story when former sports minister Tracey Crouch revealed she recently turned down the chance toto Government because of her three-year-old son Freddie.She’s still an MP but says: “I may or may not ever get the chance again to join the Cabinet, but I definitely won’t get this time back with Freddie.”And therein lies the rub for any Government, or indeed corporation, trying to inflate the number of women appointed to jobs that pay extremely well and, consequently, often involve great responsibility and super-human levels of commitment.As I have frequently suggested in this column over the years, the paucity of women in the Cabinet and certain boardrooms isn’t necessarily down to sexism, it might also be because women have chosen not to be there.We have the wombs, therefore we have the babies. That’s unlikely to change any time soon.Some manage — with the help of nannies or wider family — to juggle a high-powered job with motherhood, somechoose the route of flexible working and somechoose to stay at home. Each to their own.But until the day that tiny hand grenade is placed on your chest and someone removes the pin . . . you never know which option you’ll take.UNDER Theresa May’s lame premiership, Remainers struggled to contain their smugness.

If I have to do that - and its not a decision I would want to take - I would ensure, as I have done previously and I will continue to make sure I do, is balance.

While no one is perfect, we all have a responsibility for our own inidual impact.The question is what we do to balance it out.Prince Harry, who had flown to Amsterdam on a commercial flight yesterday, encouraged people to be more conscious about their travel as he launched his initiative Travalyst, which he has been working on for three years.Harry admitted I am not a tourism or business expert, but added: Sometimes the scale of the conservation crisis feels overwhelming and that inidual actions cant make a dference.Ive certainly felt that - but Ive learned that we cannot dismiss the idea of trying to do something, just because we cant do everything.A royal source previously admitted it has not been lost on him that the criticism he has faced over his own travel could overshadow the campaign - the first for the new Sussex Foundation.Yesterday Piers Morgan blasted the prince preaching about eco-tourism - despite jetsetting on private planes over the summer.Figures released last year showed the royal households carbon emission from travelling for business almost doubled last year.Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but the Daily Mail reports an aide said Harry had used a figure of speech when he cited the  per cent figure.They added some unknown private travel would have been taken commercially.Harry and we Meghan Markle, , had been snapped in the South of France last month after enjoying a break at Sir Elton Johns palatial £million pad.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex flew on a -seater Cessna plane, which would have cost more than £, to hire, that generates seven times the emissions per person when compared to a commercial flight.And earlier in August, the couple flew to Ibiza to celebrate Meghans th birthday in style with a six-day trip.Prince Harry also headed to a super secret Google Camp event in Sicily on July , giving an impassioned barefoot speech about climate change to celebs believed to include Leonardo DiCaprio, Naomi Campbell, Stella McCartney and Harry Styles.The new dad was previously defended by high profile celebs including Elton John - who revealed he had paid for the couples trip to France and made the flight carbon neutral.Prince Harry said yesterday: Ive always offset my CO, I think part of the group discussion we had earlier was, What is offsetting CO  There are so many people out there that hear about it, dont know about it. In my mind its the right thing to do and we need to make it cool, but it cant just be a ticking-the-box exercise.Somehow we have to connect people to where that little bit of extra money is actually going and, the moment you have that connection, you feel you have a bigger purpose in le, and you can actually see the dference youre making, and I think thats acceptable.She has hired Sunshine Sachs — a firm whose clients included the late pop star Michael Jackson, who has been accused of paedophilia.In a massive break with royal tradition, the Duchess went behind the backs of Buckingham Palace advisers to hire the company, known for using the so-called “dark arts” of public relations to improve the celebs’ reputations."},{"url":null,"title":"wooden bench up sale views gower wales beach","story":"It is perched on the tip of a clf overlooking the stunning Three Clfs Bay in Wales - which recently topped a poll of Britains best picnic spots.The sandy beach has stunning views of the Bristol Channel and is a popular beauty spot for walkers and swimmers.The bench is all that remains of a ramshackle wooden cabin put up more than  years ago.The single-storey wooden shed clad in cedar shingling was built in  but fell into disrepair when the owner passed away.Known as The Cabin, it was demolished in  after planning permission was granted to build a new structure.A spokesperson for agents Fine and Country said: The Cabin will not fail to impress you, from the moment you step into the grounds you feel like you have just entered a dferent land.This spectacular waterside location offers a superb chance to purchase a development opportunity.MOST READ IN NEWS\" data-srcset\"https:i.wp www.thesun wp-content uploads   NINTCHDBPICT.jpg croppx%Cpx%Cpx%Cpxresize%Cssl\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" SURPRISE ATTACK Husband told we to cover eyes, counted down from  and kned her neck \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AD-COMPOSITE-Trampoline.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" bounce back Boy, , has spring stuck in back after it fired off trampoline like a bullet \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AD-COMPOSITE-Holly-Roe-v.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" LatestBABY DEATH Dad charged with murdering eight-week-old daughter as mum, , let it happen \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   AD-COMPOSITE-Boris-Corbyn-NEW-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" FOWL PLAY, JEZ Boris blasts chicken Corbyn for running scared of Brexit general election \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   KH-COMPOSITE-MISSING-GIRL-FOUND-.jpg stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" HOMECOMING Girl whose dad lost her on train  YEARS ago finally reunited with her parents \" data-srcset\"https:www.thesun wp-content uploads   bercow.png stripallwhcrop\" srcSet\"\" sizes\" px, px\"  px, px\" OUT OF ORDER John Bercow blasted for using Michael Goves children in personal attack on MP It’s just a stone throw away from the intoxicating, award-winning beach of Three Clfs Bay and steps away from Gower coastal and countryside paths.The land currently has approved planning permission for a three bedroom bungalow, including an open-plan kitchen living space, a master bedroom with an ensuite and a sunroom - all providing ample opportunity to take advantage of the surrounding scenery.There is also the potential to apply for planning permission for a more substantial property.The Cabin is available for £, and will go up for public auction on October  at pm in the Marriott Hotel Swansea Marina."},{"url":null,"title":"philip hammond remain coup tory split","story":"The ex-Chancellor led the charge as the Conservative Party fell into utter disarray and the Prime Minister’s working majority was slashed to zero.As bad feelings erupted, No aides accused him of repeatedly “interrupting” the PM and “chuntering” during a bitter Downing Street dust-up this morning.They claimed that Mr Hammond revealed the anti-No Deal bill had been drafted with the help of the EU legal services department — a claim that his aides bitterly denied.Mr Johnson had made a last-ditch bid to win round  rebels ahead of tonight’s Commons vote.Mr Hammond — the right-hand man of former PM Theresa May — and others had been urged to side with the Tories rather than “handing power to a Junta including Jeremy Corbyn”.Mr Johnson had pleaded with rebels to delay their mutiny until after the EU Council next month — telling them: “No PM would accept this.”He added: “If you vote for this bill, I cannot negotiate with Brussels any longer.

His demands are unreal and I cannot condone No Deal.”Mr Lee — a pro-EU MP for the safe seat of Bracknell who was already facing de-selection — blamed the party’s sht to the right on Brexit for his walkout.THE  Tories who rebelled in tonight’s vote are:The defection rubbed out the PM’s wafer-thin majority of just one, making a General Election now all but certain.In a bid to inflict maximum damage on Mr Johnson, he publicly crossed the Commons floor to sit on the opposition benches just as the Premier began a statement to a packed house on the G summit.No also confirmed that the serial Tory rebel — who wants a second referendum — gave the PM no warning about his move.Former Education Secretary Justine Greening began the walkouts this morning saying she would stand down at the next General Election to pre-empt the PM’s punishment.She said: “My concerns about the Conservative Party becoming the Brexit Party have come to pass.”But rebel leader Mr Hammond vowed to fight Mr Johnson’s threat through the courts having won re-selection from his constituency association on Monday night.Other loyal Tories angrily hit out at Mr Johnson’s expulsion threat. Former de facto Deputy PM Damian Green dubbed the crackdown “foolish in the extreme”.He added: “The threat of deselection used to be the preserve of the hard left of the Labour party.

They’re not all “champions”, or possibly even the best each respective part of the Cowell empire has to offer.That goose was cooked the moment SuBo, Diversity, Dennis Egeland almost everyone  with a signicant career or talent declined to appear.There was a certain curiosity value to BGT: The Champions, though, I’ll admit, as it featured several performers doing the one thing everyone in their country should arguably be forbidden from even attempting.Indian salsa, Ukrainian sand-painting, Australian stand-up comedy, Indonesian magic, British dog dancing.This last one was  winner Ashleigh Butlerwho began by revealing that, moments before Pudsey died: “He lted his head and had a little look at me.That was him saying ‘Goodbye’.” Or  him saying: “You’ll be going through the same motions, with some hyperactive little impostor, in two years’ time, mark my words.”I got the impression everyone  at the show thought it might just be “a bit too soon”, as well, which may not entirely explain The Champions’ in-built British bias.But the line-up was certainly front-loaded with other familiar faces, Paul Potts, Boogie Storm and Connie Talbot, who’s doubled in size since we last saw her, with Piers Morgan, in . So’s Piers Morgan, for that matter.The great unknown factors were the foreign acts, though, who proved to be a pretty forgettable bunch apart from America’s “comic daredevil” Bello Nock, whose wheel of death t***tery, with daughter Annaliese, was almost as terrying as his appearance,which was described perfectly, by David Walliams, as “Jedward’s dad”.It was certainly enough to hypnotise the Wembley arena audience into voting him the winner.If all this exotica and the set were designed to make us think we were watching something on the scale of Eurovision, though, it failed. The Champions is nothing like as good.Nor is it even as original as Going For Gold, with Henry Kelly, for the simple reason BGT has been welcoming foreign acts for years.All this adds up to is Britain’s Got Talent minus the best bit, the auditions. We also don’t get a chance to vote, either.That came down to a golden buzzer Amanda Holden went for the Ukrainian sandpainter and the arena vote for Bello Nock.Quite something, isn’t it, when we can’t even win such a heavily loaded show and, I have to tell you, Paul Potts took it pretty badly. Simon Cowell, though, had some words of comfort for Ashleigh.“Pusdey’s in dog heaven, looking down on you now, thinking . . . ” “I was the talent. I was the bloody talent.”DIVA Forever’s Gemma Collins landed in Los Angeles last Wednesday night on ITVBe with all the charm and subtlety of a jolt from the San Andreas Fault.Take comfort, though, from the fact our gain is very much Calornia’s loss.Because within five minutes of arriving she’d already decided, “I ain’t going back to England”, and was using her new catchphrase to describe everything.Hamburgers  “Next level.” Hollywood Hills mansions  “Next level.” The Beverly Wilshire hotel  It’s next friggin’ level. She seemed to have her priorities right, though.Before going anywhere near a green card applicationshe got pretend friend Jonathan Cheban to take her to cosmetic surgeon to the stars, Doctor Simon Ourian: “Because I want a facelt while I’m here.How long will I need ” How long have you got, Gemma  It’s next level.FINAL word on Celebs Go Dating belongs to ­brilliant narrator Rob Beckett.Lauren Goodger: “Everyone’s, like, ‘Did you find love, did you meet anyone ’And I’m, like, yeah I did. I found Lauren Goodger.”“S**test game of hide and seek ever.”BBC’s brilliant Untouchable: The Rise And Fall Of Harvey Weinstein documentary.Damon Herriman’s performance as Charles Manson in episode five, series two, of Netflix’s Mindhunter.ITV’s impressively handled A Confession. And theof greatest ever breakfast television duo Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid to GMB.Cos I don’t mind telling you, I’ve really missed the hoary old cricket anecdotes, that unfeasibly small yet hyperactive mouth and all three of those le-insurance-risk chins. And Piers as well. IF this fth series of Peaky Blinders achieves nothing , then Irish actor Brian “Jimmy McCavern” Gleeson’s attempt at a Scottish accent has certainly highlighted the problems of frictionless borders.Back and forth it pings between Dublin and Belfast.With the odd stop-off in downtown Hyderabad, before settling at something closer to Hercule Poirot Belgian rather than the leader of a depression-era Glaswegian razor gang thug he’s meant to be.It has a knock-on effect as well. Notice one thing that’s wrong with the show, you’ll probably notice everything  as well.Like the fact it’s all over the place historically, Paul “Arthur” Anderson is over-acting so badly the estate of Yosemite Sam should sue and Helen McCrory doesn’t look foxy dressed up as Janet Jackson. She just looks ridiculous.Underneath all that baggage and the obtrusive soundtrack, there is, I think, a serviceable enough plot involving Oswald Mosley, the IRA, the UVF, even though they weren’t formed until , and all sorts of carnage involving gypsies and Glasgow’s infamous Billy Boys gang, which our friend Brian Gleeson attempted to put into sharp focus at the end of Sunday night’s episode.“Zo, Tummy ­Shell-beee, it’s wuuuurgh yur wunt, it’s wurgh you zjall ’ave.” No, me neither.THIS week’s winner is BBC Breakfast presenter Dan Walker and Beaker from The Muppets.Compiled by Graham WrayJONATHAN Ross, in , to producer Andy Davies, on the subject of his -year-old neighbour: “I think you should, just for charity, give her one.”Jonathan Ross, in August , to Judge Rinder, on the subject of Brazilian President Bolsonaro’s disparaging remarks about Emmanuel Macron’s we: “I’m team Macron.It’s the most pathetic and most misogynistic thing they could say. It’s pretty awful, it’s pretty horrible really.”Jonathan, you’re a helluva guy.Sink Or Swim, Arg: “I’m going to be the plus-sized Michael Phelps.”And for all those wondering what the technical term for that is, it’s Michael Feltz.LIKE most of you, I watched a lively old bird called Judith serenade four sets of shrivelling male goolies with a chorus of The Lord Is My Shepherd before taking all of her clothes off on Wednesday night’s Naked Attraction.Then I switched over to Newsnight, where arch-Remainer Paul Mason was discussing Brexit and, I promise you, he sounded about a thousand times more unhinged. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Tory leader brought his signature chaotic style to the House of Commons duel with Labouraposs leader - hours after losing his majority.He branded the Labour leader Caracas over his backing for Venezuela in a recycled joke, and he swore in Parliament to distract from his own problems, branding Labouraposs policy s*** or bust.As you might expect, amid all the bluster and buffoonery there were some claims which, well, were flatly untrue. Here are  things the Prime Minister said that make us question his relationship with the truth.  Attacking Jeremy Corbyn, the PM declared: He wants a tax on homes and heaposs calling incessantly for a general strike. Weaposre not aware that the Labour leader has been calling for a general strike at all in recent months, let alone incessantly. Backbench Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle did call for one last week in the Mirror, saying it looks more and more like the only way forward to stop our country falling into the hands of the undemocratic right. More signicantly, shadow cabinet office minister Laura Smith called for a general strike at an event in . But at the time of the comments, Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long Bailey insisted a general strike was not Labour party policy. Ms Long-Bailey said in September : Well thataposs not our position. Laura is an absolutely amazing MP, sheaposs one of the North West MPs with myself, sheaposs so full of energy and enthusiasm, but weaposre certainly not advocating general strikes as Labour Party policy. Jeremy Corbyn told PMQs : At the weekend [ Michael Gove ] said food prices will go up under no deal.Mr Johnson swiped back: The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said absolutely no such thing, I can tell him. The preparations for no deal thanks to his good offices and thanks to his efforts are very far advanced. So what did Michael Gove say  He told the BBC: There are a number of economic factors in play. Some prices may go up. Other prices will come down.” Itaposs true that Mr Gove said may rather than will. But itaposs a bit rich to say Jeremy Corbynaposs account of his comments was absolutely untrue. . aposI donapost negotiate in publicapos Jeremy Corbyn demanded to know details of the fruitless quest to abolish the Irish backstop clause of the Brexit deal. Boris Johnson replied: As [ Jeremy Corbyn ] knows very well, you donapost negotiate in public. Thataposs the same Boris Johnson who said earlier this week: Or that tomorrow MPs will vote - with Jeremy Corbyn - for yet another pointless delay. I don’t think they will. I hope that they won’tButthey do they will plainly chop the legs out from under the UK position and make any further negotiation absolutely impossible And so I say, to show our friends in Brussels that we are united in our purpose, MPs should vote with the government against Corbyn’s pointless delay. He also said: I want everybody to know – there are no circumstances in which I will ask Brussels to delay. We are leaving on  October, no s or buts. Yep, definitely keeping his cards close to his chest on strategy there. . aposDelaying Brexit will cost £billion a monthapos  The Prime Minister said in a comment:[Jeremy Corbyn] would squander a billion pounds a month of taxpayersapos money on staying pointlessly in the EU this government is getting on with running a sound economy. But will delaying Brexit cost £billion a month  The Full Fact fact-checking website says this cost is only when compared to a no-deal Brexit in which the UK refuses to pay any orce bill. It also doesnapost include money the UK gets back out of the EU, Full Fact said. Donapost forget Boris Johnson is insisting heaposll get a Brexit deal, which could of course involve a continuing relationship with the EU. . aposI donapost want an election - or do I apos Okay, so this final example seems to be one of Boris Johnson accidentally telling the truth.He told the SNPaposs Ian Blackford: I want to have an election... He then immediately corrected himself: Iaposm willing to have an election[Jeremy Corbynaposs] terrible Bill [to stop no-deal] goes through. Heaposs been continually insisting he doesnapost want a general election despite actively holding a vote to hold one on October .

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA sobering realisation has dawned which summed up how far the Tories have walked away from sanity towards self-destruction. Party grandee Sir Nicholas Soames declared that he felt so passionately about Boris Johnson’s unscrupulous power grab he was prepared to vote against his government and pay the price of deselection as an MP. In other words, Johnson, the great Churchill wannabe who fancies himself as the true heir to the mightiest of Conservative legends, would be faced with telling Winston’s grandson he was booting him out of his Tory seat for defying his wishes. Even though Soames became a Conservative MP at around the time Johnson left school. And Johnson is an unelected Downing Street squatter with a majority of none.  Had you told informed political observers a few years ago that such a scenario would unfold in , they would have laughed in your face . But the party that loves to refer to itself as “the longest-running and most successful in political history” is now so far removed from reality it cannot see how it is allowing itself to be ripped apart like the entrails of a fox during a Beaufort Hunt. Former Chancellor Philip Hammond, who usually has the placid demeanour of a bereavement counsellor, said he and fellow MPs were “incensed” by Johnson’s aggressive tactics and “feel very strongly that now is the time we have to put the national interest ahead of any threats to us personally”. Another former minister, the normally placid Justine Greening, said she’d had enough of Johnson’s “profoundly un-Conservative” no-deal policy and was walking before she could be pushed by vowing to stand down at the next election.    Alistair Burt, Caroline Nokes and Antoinette Sandbach did the same, with the latter saying: “I feel so strongly about this that I’m prepared to put my job on the line for my constituents.” And we learned they weren’t the only natural Tories whom Johnson has tried to shaft since he has been in power. A document was released to an Edinburgh court which showed he gave the go-ahead on August  to suspend Parliament, two weeks before asking the monarch to allow him to prorogue it as a last resort. So he’s even conning the -year-old Queen. But did we expect anything  from a proven liar, who is consumed with a belief he was born to rule and is willing to crush anyone and anything, including his nation’s best interests, to achieve it  No. Especially now his strings are being pulled by a clearly unhinged master of the dark arts, his chief of staff Dominic Cummings, whom David Cameron once called a “career psychopath”. Sadly this country is being run by the least principled and least talented Tory government ever. But Johnson is not the sole cause of his party’s horror show. He has just strolled on to the set with a gimp mask and a blood-drenched machete  minutes before the final credits. He is merely the grimmest ghoul at the finale of the ghost train ride who is driving it on to the rocks. To find out who is the real author of its demise go back to  when Cameron unveiled his plan to escape from a coalition government by promising a “simple referendum on membership of the EU”.

Shutting down Parliament to suspend its sovereignty, threatening to break the law, then bullying MPs, vowing to end their careersthey did what he did twice and voted against Brexit, were the desperate histrionics of a flailing tinpot tyrant in Drowning Street. His supposed masterstrokes backfired spectacularly, forcing insulted Conservatives to find their backbones and stand up to a political flibbertigibbet.    No mandate or majority exists in the country or in Parliament for the Kamikaze type of Brexit an untrustworthy Boris Johnson suddenly pretends is a runner. Equally, his claim that talks with the EU are making progress is unsupported by the evidence – although you cannot rule out the possibility that in future this twister would try to pass off Theresa May’s thrice-rejected “vassal state” plan as his own, inspired, fresh magical answer. Shackling mendacious Johnson and putting his Halloween Horror back in the box is vital before a General Election is held.

And he boasted no department will be cut next year as he vowed to tear up fiscal rules ahead of the next Budget to turn the page on austerity, after nearly a decade of swingeing cuts. Vowing uncertainty around Brexit could not distract from the peopleaposs priorities, Mr Javid said: Thanks to the hard work of the British people we can now afford to turn the page on austerity and move forwards from a decade of recovery to a decade of renewal.But todayaposs statement covered just one year, was not a full spending review , and many announcements were reheated pledges from Boris Johnson .   And with Mr Johnson demanding an October  election, Mr Javid took more than  minutes to get to the details - leading to the Commons Speaker telling him off twice for blatantly veering off-topic. The event came hours after Mr Johnson lost his Commons majority by taking the whip from  Tory rebels who voted to stop a no-deal Brexit. Moments after the Spending Round, MPs began debating a Bill in Parliament to prevent Boris Johnson crashing out of the EU on October .And on the same night Mr Johnson would hold a debate on holding an early election on October . But Labour were due to vote against - because they wanted to ensure no-deal is blocked first.   Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the pathetic sum for departments on their knees after nine years of Tory austerity was adding insult to injury. He branded the statement an opportunist one-year spending review and said social care was receiving only a sticking plaster with no long-term reform. And he said the statement was a distraction from a government with no mandate, no morals and no majority, adding: A government not just callous but uncaring as well. This isnapost a government, itaposs a racket. So what has the government announced today  Hereaposs everything you need to know at a glance.   A .% or £.bn rise in public spending, including £.bn for capital spending - the fastest increase in day-to-day spending in  years. These extra funds take the real increase in day-to-day spending to £. billion or .%, the Chancellor added. No-deal Brexit Extra £bn for Brexit preparations in  , matching £bn in  . It brings the total spent on planning for and delivering Brexit since the  referendum to more than £.bn. Police    Extra £m for policing for first year of plan to recruit , officers. Another £m in  to kick-start recruitment. First , officers due to be in place by March  and , a year later. Counter-terror budget rises with inflation by continuing extra £m announced in  Budget. But Labouraposs John McDonnell said: They seem to forget they cut , police officers. And he warned only , of the new PCs may be on the streets. Schools    £.bn rise to the schools budget in   and £.bn in  . Minimum per pupil amount of £k for secondary and £, for primary schools, rising to £k for primaries in  . £m more for additional schools funding to help children with special educational needs, an % rise in a year. Teacheraposs starting salaries rise to £, by   - by which time overall school spending to rise by £.bn. But Labouraposs John McDonnell said: The Chancellor has announced new spending of £.bn next year. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has previously estimated that it would cost £.bn this year alone to reverse the cuts that have been made. Home Office    .% aposreal terms riseapos in Home Office spending - which the Chancellor said was the biggest increase in  years. Places of Worship fund doubled to £.m, in reheated announcement from March, to protect mosques, synagogues, churches and others from attacks. £m to tackle scourge of online child sexual exploitation including cash for technology, intelligence and enforcement. £m extra - plus £m syphoned off Foreign Aid budget - for asylum system to support and protect the most vulnerable refugees. Nurseries  £m extra for nurseries after years of complaints they are starved of cash under the Toriesapos  hoursapos free childcare scheme. But campaigners warned it was a sticking plaster. It is understood the current minimum hourly that nurseries receive under the scheme is £.. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said it filled just a tenth of the £m funding gap. NHS    -year settlement for the NHS worth £.bn more per year by   - including a £.bn rise in NHS funding next year. Including... £bn more for NHS capital spending in   - but only from hospitalsapos own budgets or projects that were approved then put on hold. £m to upgrade facilities and equipment in  hospitals. £m for AI on issues like detecting cancer. £m for training opportunities to NHS staff in a bid to improve standards and retain nurses, midwives and allied health professionals.

Tonight’s humiliating defeat at the hands of Labour, other parties and Tory rebels who refused to be intimidated, marked the end of the shortest Downing Street honeymoon ever. The conceited Johnson stirred up a hornets’ nest, with his contempt for a sovereign Parliament provoking a democratic reaction. Without a mandate or a majority, he is struggling to persuade MPs who want to see the back of him to grant a General Election. An election we must have and soon. But it can’t be a contest dictated by a tinpot tyrant itching to Britain over his Brexit clf edge. We the people must be the masters now with untrustworthy, double-dealing Johnson sacked in the national interest. Web of deceit Cleaners and cabbies paying a higher tax rate than an arm of Amazon’s retail empire shows our financial system is working for the wealthy corporate few instead of the hardworking many. The £million the US-based online giant paid in corporation tax on a juicy £.million profit is peanuts – and even that paltry contribution is lower than last year. It benefits from public spending on the education and health of its workers and customers, from investment in transport and the maintaining of law and order. So it should be paying a fair and decent contribution. Attempted justications from a multinational totting up tax from a dozen operations in the UK will cut little ice with grafters who feel huge multinationals are not taxed enough.

Jeremy Corbyn was not a natural when he started doing  PMQs but today he showed, in his first outing against Boris Johnson, that his years of practice have not been in vain. Practice may not make perfect but this was comfortably one of the Labour leader’s better performances at the Despatch Box. Corbyn has clocked the best way to exploit the weaknesses of his opponent. Johnson feeds on bluster and showmanship. By contrast, Corbyn was restrained and dignied. He peppered the Prime Minister with detailed questions and then sat back to watch him flap and flail as he struggled to compose something approaching an adequate answer. Johnson came across as a cameo actor who has been given too much screen time. It was like watching a music hall star rattle out a string of old and hackneyed jokes in the age of alternative comedy.  Corbyn’s first few questions were sharpish and simple. When will the Prime Minister provide details of the proposals he has put forward to the EU  Will he publish the proposals he has put forward to replace the Irish backstop  Will he publish the Governmentaposs Operation Yellowhammer report on no-deal planning  Johnson had no answers so resorted to attacking Corbyn for refusing to back his demand for a general election. He then accused the Labour leader of undermining the Brexit negotiations by backing the Bill aiming to block a no-deal Brexit. Corbyn has often been accused of being slow to think on his feet. Not this time. “I fail to understand how I can be undermining the negotiations when no negotiations are not taking place,” he said, slaying Johnsonaposs argument.  Those who like Johnson’s shtick will have enjoyed his jibe that Corbyn was running scared from an election like a “chlorinated chicken.” And those who have not heard his “Caracas crackers” pun before may have found it hilarious but then some people find Mrs Brown’s Boys funny. Few would find amusing the way the PM switched from claiming to not wanting an election to demanding Corbyn back one in the same sentence. The rest of the Johnson’s time was spent either reliving the EU referendum or boasts about the increased expenditure on the police and NHS. Perhaps Corbyn should have picked him up on the fact that this extra investment was barely compensating for the cuts made by a Tory Government Johnson of which Johnson was a member. But in the end this was about the contrast between the clinical and sober questioning of Corbyn and the waffle and bluster of the Prime Minister.

Super-organised Tracy Fitzgerald says her method saves her precious minutes every day - and also helps give her children independence. Instead of raiding wardrobes and drawers every morning, five daysapos worth of school shirts, jumpers, trousers, socks and pants are bundled together on a Sunday. The -year-old has bought them a set of Ikea drawers each which the children can help themselves to every morning, where they will find their full unorm, including underwear. Tracy, from Hull, has been organising her childrenaposs clothes in this way for the past two years and says it makes her mornings much less chaotic with daughter Megan, eight, and son Nathan, seven.  She said: Mornings can be stressful and busy and the last thing I want to be doing is searching for clothes. Everyone always says that I am the queen or organising things, whether it be events or just le, and this is just another way Iaposm organised. In every drawer for both kids is trousers, socks, pants, vests, polo shirt and obviously as it gets colder, their jumpers cardigans. It must save at least  minutes which is precious time when you like your sleep.    You can use the spare bottom drawer for their shoes too, although I have another set of these drawers in the hallway that has a drawer each for shoes and another for their bags.

The stone-built homes were built on a plot in the West Pennine moors near Bolton, but have fallen foul of officials. Finishing works have been halted after it was discovered they had not been built in line with approved planning permissions. The buildings - known as Grundy Fold - had been put in dferent positions on the development than those agreed and some were bigger than they were supposed to be. Specically, the footprint and total floor areas are larger than approved and the height of three houses is higher than permitted.    The footprint of one property was sqm over what was agreed with the council while the height of another property saw an increase of .m. The owners tried to broker a deal with local planners after being told that the properties - which they have never lived in - would have to be torn down. They offered to demolish and then rebuild two homes and alter one other at a cost to themselves of over £m but this was rejected last week. Bolton Council planning committee decided the houses were still too big and far away from each other.    It also ruled that it represented inappropriate development within one of the most prominent greenbelt sites in West Bolton. The local authority first issued an enforcement notice to flatten the entire development last year following an impasse with the developers Sparkle Developments. The enforcement notice to demolish the properties - each sold by the developer to the homeowners on a freehold basis - is currently on hold as the decision has been appealed by the developer. But the latest setback last week means the homeowners are now going into a three-day inquiry to hear the appeal in November facing the prospect of losing their properties altogether. The Bolton News have reported how homeowner Elan Raja told councillors during the meeting about the immense challenge he and the other plot owners have faced.  During last weekaposs committee meeting, he said: Given the plots are our homes, the unfolding of ious twists and turns of all applications, itaposs been nothing short of a living hell. There have been big implications of all areas of our daily lives. The financial burden, the threat of loss, the emotional impact, theyaposve all stacked up. And with that, we wish to bring matters to a successful conclusion. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Raja added: We remain committed to working with the local planning authority to find a compromise in line with the officeraposs report and in line with what Cllr Bob Allen had stated about coming back with a new application. The site previously comprised the farmhouse to Grundy Fold Farm, three large metal clad buildings, one large stone barn, two brick and breeze block built buildings and numerous small temporary buildings and structures.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman has revealed how experiencing the smell of burning toast and other bizarre symptoms led her to being diagnosed with a brain tumour. Yasmin Clapp, from Exeter, had initially dismissed the symptoms but when they persisted she sought help from doctors. The -year-old, who works for a Devon tool supply company, recalled: “Looking back the first time was in  at work and I remember a colleague saying that I was just staring into space and mumbling.  “I was sat there realising I could smell burning and at the same time all the voices I could hear around me, I’d heard them before – it was just like a déjà vu moment. After that I couldn’t talk properly for a while and a huge wave of tiredness came over me.” After putting it down to being just a aposstrange sensationapos, in July the following year it started happening again.   She told Devon Live : “In September  I was in the kitchen making cheese on toast and I had a moment the smell, the déjà vu and of course the toast started burning as well so I was surrounded by real and imagined smells.My mum rushed in and said, ‘Yasmin, you’re mumbling’, so I we went to the doctor and he referred me straight away to have an epilepsy test done at the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital. “I had electrical wires on my head in place for two days and the whole works, but they found nothing. A neurologist then scheduled me for an MRI, originally for February , but the moments weren’t going away so luckily my doctor pushed for the scan to be brought forward to October . That scan showed Yasmin had a brain tumour. She said: “At the time they weren’t sure that the tumours would even need surgery but then I got a call saying there was two little dots on the scan that I called ‘dumb and dumber. The seriousness of Yasmin’ diagnosis had now escalated and surgeons told her she would need an awake craniotomy urgently. “It’s really strange when I look back at it now, she admitted. I don’t know how I did it but it went really well for me. “I always remember it because it was March  and there was a lot of snow in the south west that year. A lot of appointments got cancelled but I had stayed the night before in a hotel nearby with my mum, so on the morning I was like, ‘yep, I’m ready!’ “Within two days I was out of hospital and  per cent of the tumours had been removed.”  The biopsy from the craniotomy showed the tumour had grade  cancerous growth, and overall she had a mixed-grade brain tumour. Yasmin then underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy due to the cancerous nature of the tumours and the process of recovery began. Very quickly she was able toto work and to build up her confidence and le again. Grateful to be alive, she said: “I was told that without my doctor being so determined to help me, I would have been worse offhe hadn’t have helped push through my tests and diagnosis. I was lucky, I had a good experience with my GP. It’s made a big dference to my le.” Yasmin is one of twenty three Young Ambassadors for The Brain Tumour Charity, raising awareness of symptoms and treatment and forming a vital leline for other young adults going through similar experiences. The charity lead and fund the HeadSmart brain tumour awareness campaign for children and young adults. Yasmin said: “Being part of the Young Ambassadors has helped me massively getting my le on track. It’s given me confidence to carry on with my work and I’ve also travelled a lot since.” Yasmin jetted off to Ibiza in August just a month after finishing chemotherapy and earlier in the year in June, she sailed with the Ellen MacArthur Cancer Trust. Now, Yasmin’s passion for raising awareness shines through.

It would also have long running ramications as Devlin would miss the League Cup final loss to Celtic and would eventually be ruled out for three months.Now, after a fresh injury set back, Devlin is back and is offered the chance to impress.Reid, capped  times for his country, insists late call-ups can provide the catalyst for a successful international career.He said: “For myself, I went to the World Cupand I was not even in the original squad.“Injury meant I went and I was the first substitute on in the first game against Cameroon.”Reid is confident Scotland can cope with the defensive injury withdrawals against Russia and a Belgium.He said: “There is no question we can still deal with that and there’s still a lot of quality there throughout the pitch.“Hopefully those that do get an opportunity come the Russia and Belgium games take their chance.“Our job as a staff is to get the ideas how we approach a game and how we play and get them organised pretty quickly.“It is about cramming as much information, detail, videos and work on the training pitch as possible to get them as prepared as possible for the games.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d668a497e6b59.78887505-651x564.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet harley basil and dexter and dakota are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This cheeky girl is  months old.

She said the sector was ready for the “huge challenge” of providing reliable energy, playing a “major role” in the net-zero emissions crusade.The roadmap is an “evolution” of Vision  – industry’s aim of fulfilling as much UK energy demand as possible from domestic production, doubling supply chain export revenues and supporting the energy transition.North Sea firms are already taking action to reduce emissions from their operations, OGUK said, adding the sector could make a huge contribution to developing low carbon technology.Oil companies face growing pressure from environmentalists and activist investors who want them to stop extracting fossil fuels and spend more money on renewables. Industry leaders have argued that oil and gas will be a vital part of the global energy mix for many decades to come.OGUK said oil and gas would meet around two-thirds of UK energy needs by , while contributing more than £. billion to the Exchequer over the next five years.The organisation also pointed out that only % of total UK emissions are from oil and gas production and the carbon intensity of North Sea operations had reduced by % since .The organisation’s report has highlighted a growing acceptance that firms must do more to shrink their carbon footprintsthey are to “maintain societal and political support”.Ms Michie added: “While we don’t have all the answers to the big challenges we face, we have started work on what we know can be done.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column july 5 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMid Argyll Pipe Band followed up success at the Helensburgh competition with a victory in the European Championships.The band#s success is the result of years of hard work and good tuition.Grade  European winner Inveraray and District Pipe Band has more of an international feel to it these days, much like a premier league football team.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Iain#s second shot came up a bit short leaving him a dficult up and down, and the drama continued as Bruce almost holed his second shot to leave a tap in birdie. With nerves of steel, Iain chipped on to four feet and duly rolled in the putt for a well deserved victory of the Sam Andrews trophy.This was Iain#s first championship victory and in his acceptance speech he told the crowd of his delight at winning while complimenting the sterling work done on the course by Graham Prentice, John MacNab and Duncan Johnstone.Iain swept the boards, also winning the nett and senior championship at the same time. Captain Smyth also presented the John Reid Quaich to Duncan Johnstone, the James Johnson Cup to Iain Johnstone and the August medal to himself.Members were treated to a lovely buffet provided by Sheena, Georgie and Catherine, with celebrations carrying on late into the evening.Final totals: , Iain Macalister  , Bruce MacNab  , John MacNab ."},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll course draws skippers and compliments","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowMid Argyll Radio Sailing put its toe in the water last Saturday when skippers arrived with their model radio controlled yachts from the club#s first competition.Several Scottish clubs # Ayr Bay Radio Yacht Club, Greenock, Rhu and Paisley # travelled to Mid Argyll joined by others from as far afield as the Preston area.A total of  yachts raced each other around the club#s Loch a Bahrain course near Cairnbaan.A steady wind from the south produced some exciting close encounters results and near misses.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

headquarters.Members of the union Unite are striking due to changes to their employment terms and conditions.Road workers descended on the local authority on the morning of Thursday August , to coincide with a full council meeting, and waved flags, shouted slogans and played lsquoMoney Money Moneyrsquo by ABBA on a PA system.Speaking at the demonstration, Willie Thomson, a regional industrial organiser for Unite, said that the dispute could risk the regionrsquos winter maintenance programme.He said: ldquoThe reason why the men are taking action is basically a refusal from Scottish Borders Council to respect the terms and conditions of their employment.ldquoThey have had changes imposed on them that will cost them poundrsquos, and they are not willing to have that done to them.ldquoThe reason they are striking is to send a strong message that the council needs to get back round the table and reach an agreement with the workers.ldquoThe people of the Scottish Borders need to be aware that the council is risking their winter maintenance service.ldquoDuring the winter maintenance service members do a lot of extra hours to keep up with the extra demand.ldquoWersquore now in a position where members will be withdrawing that programme.ldquoThat work is done a voluntary basis and the good will that is required to do that is in short supply.Currently, summer standby for Scottish Borders Councilrsquos road workers is voluntary, but council chiefs are trying to make this mandatory, in line with other sections of the council.Earlier this year, Scottish Borders Council notied the unions that not enforcing the same terms and conditions across the whole council could leave the local authority open to gender pay discrimination claims, as the mainly male roads section of the council is not required to be on standby over the summer, whereas the mainly female care home staff are.Summer standby payment for roads workers is currently pound., albeit it on a voluntary basis, and Scottish Borders Council is offering to up this to pound as long as it becomes mandatory.The two main unions which represent road workers at Scottish Borders Council, Unite and Unison, have been in discussion with the council ever since it informed employees that the terms and conditions would change.However, the talks with Unite broke down, and .% of the unionrsquos members who voted in an industrial ballot voted for strike action. The turn out was %.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos chief executive Tracey Logan,said: ldquoThe council has not changed terms and conditions for this staff group, nor have we failed to consult the trade unions or the staff affected.ldquoIn fact, we discovered some months ago that a small number of staff in this section had been claiming a higher rate of overtime than they were entitled to under the agreed terms and conditions.ldquoThey were also claiming for time to travel to work when working weekend overtime, which again is not in line with the agreement in place.ldquoGiven that Unite agreed to these terms and conditions, I am surprised and disappointed that they now want some of their members to be given more favourable pay rates than others, and for this small group be able to claim additional allowances that their other members cannot.ldquoIt is a principle of fairness and equality for staff across the whole workforce and one which I would expect Unite as representatives of staff to uphold and commit to."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bar-cream-crop-scottish-cuisine","story":"A BAR and restaurant is the toast of Selkirk after winning the Best Scottish Cuisine title at Food Awards Scotland .The celebration of the countrys best restaurants, takeaways, pubs, hotel restaurants, cafes and bistros was held last week in Glasgow.Within the restaurant category it was the The Fleece Bar  Kitchen which was announced as cream of the crop when it comes to presenting Scottish cuisine.Trevor and Tracey Ward, who have owned the historic Selkirk inn since , were delighted with the latest accolade.Tracey told us: \"Wersquore absolutely delighted to have been awarded this accolade which celebrates the very best Scotland has to offer in the hospitality industry.\"To win the category of Best Scottish Cuisine when wersquore a family run restaurant situated in a small Borders town, is testament to the commitment and focus of our staff and the support we have from our customers and the community.\"There were some great, long established restaurants in our category and for us to have come out on top was a welcome surprise!Over the past three years the Wards, along with trainee chef son Ryan, have been rewarded with a regular stream of five-star reviews from delighted customers.And the awards shelf is filling up as quickly as their restaurant diary.Another Borders establishment which was also honoured last week at the Food Awards Scotland was Stewarts Cafe Bistro in Jedburgh.The High Street business was named as the regional Cafe Bistro winner.Creative Oceanic has been organising and hosting the awards for the past six years.CEO Irfan Younis told us: ldquoCongratulations to all winners and finalists at the sixth Food Awards Scotland .\"We welcomed and rewarded some of the best in the Scottish food industry who serve us up some of the tastiest food, enhance our culture, deliver top quality customer service and provide us with some of the best banter around.

The overall revenue budget for the upkeep of parks across the Borders is contained within the budget for neighbourhood services and no savings are projected from this budget as a result of the play programme.ldquoThe removal of old play equipment from playparks, which following appraisal, deemedto be low value facilities, will allow for sufficient resources to be deployed to maintain thenew facilities being invested in by the council through the outdoor community spacescapital project on an ongoing basis.ldquoThe new facilities include more pieces of equipment, widening access and providinghigher play value than the previous, aged, low-amenity, play equipment. Thedecommissioning of the older low value facilities will ensure the revenue impact to the parks and environment service budget is cost neutral.ldquoI would further confirm that no play park will be decommissioned until such times as thenew play park investment in that locality is complete.ldquoMembers should also note that no town or village which currently has a play park will beleft without one following the upgrade process.Tweeddale West councillor Heather Anderson also queried the council leader, asking for an update on the proposed closure of eleven parks in her ward.Councillor Haslam told the chamber: ldquoThe council requested feedback to the programme for decommissioning of play parks with an end date of August .ldquoOfficers will now undertake a review of the feedback and, where appropriate, respond prior to implementing the council decision.ldquoIn announcing a signicant investment in outdoor community facilities the council recognised the need to address the historic over provision of low value playparks, indeed the council is in amongst the largest providers of play parks per  head of population when compared to similar authorities, however when it comes to quality it is amongst the lowest in play value terms.ldquoThe council decision to invest in destination playparks and decommission those play parks which are obsolete does not remove the spaces from fulfilling an important community need in terms of access to open spaces.ldquoThese spaces can be used for informal play and have the potential to help the council address other issues such as its obligation to identy places for community food growing.Scottish Borders Council recently spent pound, on a new playpark at Harestanes Countryside Visitor Centre, near Ancrum, which follows on from new parks built in Galashiels, Oxton, and Stow.The council also opened up a new playpark in Hawick in  as part of the regeneration of WIlton Lodge Park, and Coldstream is set to be next to receive a new playpark with a pound, facility set to open in Home Park at the end of the month."},{"url":null,"title":"driving-legend-jackie-opens-museum-39-great-friend-39","story":"SIR Jackie Stewart praised Jim Clark as a driver and as a friend when he officially opened the refurbished Jim Clark Museum on Thursday in Duns.Clark won two Formula  World Championships, in  and , claiming overall a total of  Grand Prix victories with  pole starts, and also the Indianapolis  in  before he died in a horric crash at Hockenheim in .Sir Jackie, who later was flying off to Spain for the weekendrsquos Grand Prix, recalled his friendship with Clark.And he revealed how he regularly visited the Borders to meet up with his lsquogreat friend.He said: ldquoWhen Jim Clark was racing he was my hero and was certainly the best racing driver I ever raced against.\"We had a great le together and he was an enormous help to me.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success. Over the week I saw impressive personal growth in the confidence and leadership of all participants, including myself.ldquoIrsquom proud of everyone involved as we delivered a yearsrsquo worth of experience and education into only seven days.ldquoIt was such a worthwhile experience and I have definitely made friends for le.Denis added: ldquoThe metrics indicated the pilot was a success, but more importantly we know that great potential had been identied and developed and we had all made new friends for le.ldquoThe last day was an emotional experience with speeches, awards and a newly written RYLA rap song with backing choir!ldquoWe sang, we danced, we ate together, it was also enormous fun!ldquoMalawi is a breathtakingly beautul country and all the participants left the RYLA camp

At that time her father was employed as an English teacher at Marr College, later transferring to the village school of Scotlandwell in Perth  Kinross.The family moved to the Borders when Mr Baxter took up the post of schoolmaster at Bowden School, eventually rising to become Director of Education for Roxburghshire County Council.The family set up home at Lindean, with Helenrsquos brother Sandy later taking over the running of Lindean Farm. Both siblings attended Lindean School, before moving to Selkirk High School.Helen undertook her basic nursing training at Edinburghrsquos Dean College, then studied for her midwery qualication at Bellshill Maternity Hospital, Glasgow. From there she headed to Jersey to serve as a midwe on the island, before ing to the Borders in the early s.In November, , she married Harry Russell, who earlier that year had been appointed Selkirkrsquos Royal Burgh Standard Bearer. The couple made their home in Lindean, with daughters Judith and Claire arriving in  and .Helen continued her nursing career at Galashiels Cottage Hospital and Peel Hospital, before taking on the joint role of district nurse  midwe for Selkirk and the Valleys, firstly based in the Nursersquos Cottage at Ettrickbridge, and then at Selkirk Health Centre.On call night and day, Helen Russellrsquos passion for the job - and her patients - knew no bounds. On one occasion an expectant motherrsquos husband roared down on his motorbike from the top of Ettrick to inform Helen his we had gone into labour.She quickly grabbed her medical bag and told him shersquod follow him in her car. lsquoNo time for that,rsquo came the reply, and next thing Helen knew she was on the back of his motorbike, clinging on for dear le as the pair of them raced back up the valley.It was said Helen Russell could spot a pregnant woman at  yards, and even in retirement she remained fiercely proud of her nursing background, maintaining close links with all her former medical colleagues.An expert dress-maker, she would create beautul ball gowns and outfits for friends and family. She also enjoyed sewing, knitting, embroidery and crocheting, last year completing a dozen poppies for the lsquoSelkirk Remembersrsquo armistice cascade at Selkirk Parish Church.Dr John Wilson, who worked as a GP at Selkirk Health Centre, remembers Helen Russell with particular affection. ldquoThe whole team at Selkirk were absolutely fantastic, he said, ldquoand the support and help Helen gave me in my early days in the town was wonderful.ldquoShe and her fellow district nurses had a lot of responsibility, and it was a great eye-opener for me to see just how professionally and selflessly they carried out all their ied duties. Helen understood exactly what was expected of her, always going out of her way to give patients the best possible care.Margaret Young, a fellow district nurse and midwe at Selkirk Health Centre, describes Helen as lsquoa force of naturersquo who was completely committed to the job.ldquoAs well as working as a school nurse she also ran parent classes in the evening, and started up a slimming club at the health centre. Nothing was ever too much trouble for Helen - she was kindness itself.ldquoI remember when the district nursesrsquo office was moved from the Cottage Hospital to the back of the health centre, we all commented on how ghastly the curtains were. On Monday morning Helen came in with a set of beautul curtains shelsquod made at the weekend, and I think they were still there when she retired!ldquoShe was such a talented person, and Irsquom sure there are many people living in the local community today who will be very glad Helen Russell was there to look after them during her time as district nurse.Helen took special delight in following the progress of her two teenage grandchildren, Angus and Allie, both of whom had stayed with their grandparents at Lindean the week before Helen was admitted to hospital.Helen Russellrsquos funeral service will be held at the Borders Crematorium on Thursday, September , at pm, to which all friends are respectively invited.J.D.R.S."},{"url":null,"title":"sajid-javid-turning-page-austerity-election-looms","story":"Sajid Javid promised he was ldquoturning the page on austerity as he embarked on a pre-election spending spree, promising cash for health, schools and the police.With Boris Johnson calling for a snap election, the Chancellor set out plans toincrease current and capital spending by pound. billion in - focused on theldquopeoplersquos priorities.----But shadow chancellor John McDonnell branded the statement a piece of ldquogrubby electioneering and accused the Government of ldquopretending to end austerity when they do nothing of the sort.The spending plan for a single year was fast-tracked to clear the decks ahead of Brexit, with the normal multi-year settlement planned for next year.In his statement, Mr Javid told MPs:ldquoWe are turning the page on austerity and beginning a new decade of renewal.ldquoA new economic era needs a new economic plan and today we lay the foundations with the fastest increase in day-to-day spending in  years.--vw,vw,px, px\"--The plan would addpound. billion to total public spending including pound. billion for capital spending.ldquoThese extra funds take the real increase in day-to-day spending to pound. billion, or .%, he said.ldquopound.bn increase in NHS funding next year.

It contains both hacked-up vessels and brooches and buckles, but it also includes a number of Roman coins from the very end of the Roman Empire.ldquoAnalysis which has been done at the British Museum suggests that it goes in the ground in the fth century ndash  to AD.ldquoWe know at that time that the monetary system in Britain has completely collapsed and we are based on a sort of bullion ndash the weight of the silver in the coins and the objects.ldquoThatrsquos been hacked up and put into very small pieces so that it can be paid out to people like mercenaries to protect you, but also to traders.ldquoThe Romans traditionally leave Britain in AD and thatrsquos seen as the Roman Brexit, as it were ndash we are at a point where that whole Roman system has collapsed, and the only way that you can go and spend money is by hacking up the old coinage and weighing it in to buy products from abroad, but also to pay people to protect you.ldquoSo these fragments of silver vessels and things no longeras an object but have turned into money.ldquoThat period is known as the Dark Ages, and in Shropshire and the West Midlands we have very few objects of that sort of date, so this hoard is absolutely a really important thing.ldquoWithout these metal detectorists we wouldnrsquot have known anything about that period in this part of Shropshire.Experts believe the hoard was probably deposited for recovery at a later date near a marker stone or a tree.Mr King, from Ashton, near Chester, told the PA news agency he was searching with Mr Lord, from Abergele in Wales, and Mr Bijsterbocsh, who lives in Blackpool, when they discovered around half a dozen coins on the surface.The -year-old, a retired supermarket manager, said: ldquoIt was a rally organised by a friend.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot.

It will reopen in spring .The closure plan was greeted with dismay in Campbeltown, with board members attacking the #scandalous# plan # with a promise to fight the #tooth and nail#.Chairman Allan McKie told The Courier this week that the move was finalised last Friday.#The decision was taken as the coreof the office is being moved to Oban,# Mr McKie said.#Membership was being handled in Campbeltown for the whole board area, and there is far bigger back-up in Oban. It was not a financial decision # it was an administrative one.#Pressed on whether he thought the closure would have an adverse effect on tourism, Mr McKie said: #I don#t think Campbeltown will suffer at all.#He continued: #In winter months, it was totally unrealistic to stay open and serve tourists, for all that there are. It is unfortunate. We took a long time to come to this decision and it is highly regrettable.#FIFTY YEARS AGORoad bridge row comes to an endThe #dry bridge# at Bridgend, Islay is to be raised to give clearance of ft ins.This was announced at the meeting of the Islay District Council on Monday.The total cost of the improvements will be borne by Western Ferries and several of the island#s distillery companies. Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

His missionary work took him all over Scotland, including the coastline of the Forth. It is said his arrival at this small natural harbour gave the place its name.Last weekend, artist Andrew Crummy, who lives in the village, organised three lsquosunset eveningsrsquo at the Boat Shore. Local musicians, singers, artists and actors gathered on the beach with an audience of fellow locals to share the sunset.I sadly couldnrsquot attend the first two but was able to make the last evening with some of my children. It was a wonderful mix of music and song, with a very funny short drama, and a setting sun as the backdrop.It was a poignant evening for myself, and I know for some others too a moment of reflection as well as coming together. I had planned to tell a tale about St Kenneth, but I changed my mind just before the event.Instead, I told a tale of a friendship between a tortoise and a butterfly and what sunsets meant to them. In story, anything is possible, and I made this tale to help ease someonersquos sadness in experiencing an ending.I was later askedI could share it, and so here is the story:There was once a tortoise who became friends with a butterfly. On the first day of their friendship, the tortoise invited the butterfly to sit with him on his favourite rock, to watch the sunset.However, Butterfly had no idea what a sunset was, and so when she saw the sun fall gradually from the sky she became concerned.ldquoWhatrsquos happening to the sun  she asked in a worried tone.ldquoItrsquos the sunset, said Tortoise, ldquoitrsquos when the sun goes down and ends the day.ldquoWhat, already! Thatrsquos it  asked Butterfly, horried. ldquoThis is just my first day being a butterfly and my days are over Tortoise smiled: ldquoNo my wee friend, itrsquos not all over. The sun will come back and there will be another day.But Butterfly remained anxious: ldquoHow can you be sure the sun will come back ldquoTrust me, I know. Irsquove seen many sunsets, said Tortoise. ldquoThe sun always comes back. Sometimes it takes longer than others, sometimes you canrsquot see the sun because of clouds, but it always s and makes another day.Butterfly was now reassured and so settled down to watch, as the sun dipped lower, painting the sky. She expected the sun to sizzle and the sea to steam when they touched each other, but of course that didnrsquot happen. The sun slid quietly below the horizon, leaving a trail of bright red and orange.ldquoThat was beautul, wasnrsquot it  Tortoise said.But Butterflyrsquos reply was unexpected: ldquoI think I donrsquot like sunsets very much.Tortoise curled up the wrinkles on his old face in surprise: ldquoWhy not, donrsquot you think it was spectacular, the way it painted the sky ldquoSuppose, but it was sad, really sad, said Butterfly.ldquoSad ldquoYes, because the sunset ends the day and thatrsquos sad. Endings are sad.Tortoise nodded in a way tortoises do when theyrsquore thinking: ldquoYes thatrsquos true, endings can be sad. But everything ends sooner or later. Nothing lasts forever.ldquoBut thatrsquos what I mean Tortoise, itrsquos so sad. I donrsquot want to sit and celebrate the end of something.Tortoise thought for a moment: ldquoAlthough endings can be sad, they also give meaning and value to our time. Without sunsets we would not treasure our days. Our le would become one long blah of sameness.ldquoA blah of sameness ldquoYes, my expression, smiled Tortoise proudly.ldquoBut thatrsquos easy for you to say, Tortoise, because you have more time than me, you will have more days.ldquoPerhaps, but that means your time is more precious than mine. And your sunsets are greater celebrations of your days.Butterfly thought about this. ldquoYou seem quite wise, Tortoise, she said, looking at her friend.ldquoYes, he replied immodestly, ldquoI do have that reputation. I suppose I have a lot of time to think, sitting on this rock.It began to get dark and colder.ldquoNow itrsquos time for our dreams. Soon there will be the sunrise, said Tortoise.ldquoSunrise  Is that when the sun s Tortoise nodded: ldquoYes, you see you donrsquot get a sunrise without a sunset. Although endings can be sad, they open the door to new beginnings. At the other side of a sunset there is a sunrise.Tortoise was indeed wise and Butterfly felt reassured by his wisdom.That summer, the two friends watched many sunsets together. They would share stories about their day as the sun went down. Then one evening, as flocks of geese were flying overhead, Butterfly spoke sadly.ldquoTortoise, I need to go. Itrsquos getting cold. Irsquom off to Africa. Do you think there are sunsets there ldquoIrsquom sure of it, replied Tortoise.ldquoI love sunsets now, said Butterfly. ldquoThey have shown me to treasure and celebrate my days. But I am sad this is our last one together.ldquoMe too, said Tortoise.The two friends sat together on their rock as the sunset commemorated their summer with a blaze of colour. Then they said goodbye.A new dawn now lay ahead for them both, for the end of one story is the beginning of another.And at the other side of a goodbye, there is a

She added: ldquoOur most recent residentsrsquo survey found high levels of satisfaction with our parks, gardens and open spaces.ldquoWe have a number of initiatives to increase sustainable management of our countryside sites and improve bioersity and pollination.ldquoThis is reflected in the work we have been doing with partners such as Buglersquos John Muir Pollinator Way project, the planting of , metres sqaure of wildflower meadow, low impact grassland management and targeted use of a weedkiller where appropriate.ldquoOur Green Network Strategy, part of our Local Development Plan, recognises the importance of vacant and derelict land for wildle, and seeks to identy suitable locations for tree planting given the important role that trees play in mitigating climate change.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

Why not have an everyday product with the best ingredients The pork meat is available all year round giving customers a steady supply of their staple shopping and this is then boosted with seasonal lamb, game and beef.

Other types of so-called surface waves decay more quickly and travel in multiple directions.Dr Tom Mackay, of the University of Edinburghrsquos School of Mathematics, who jointly led the study, said: ldquoDyakonov-Voigt waves represent a step forward in our understanding of how light interacts with complex materials, and offer opportunities for a range of technological advancements.The team identied the wavesrsquo unique properties using mathematical models that incorporated equations developed by Maxwell.Since the mid-s, research on how light interacts with crystals has built on the work of the physicist, who helped to lay the foundations for fields such as special relativity and quantum mechanics.Born in , Maxwell was the son of an Edinburgh advocate.When Maxwell was a child, the family moved to Dumfriesshire when they inherited Middlebie Estate.One early tutor is said to have claimed that he was slow at learning, however he went on to study at the Edinburgh Academy, with his first scientic paper being published at the age of .He then went on to the University of Edinburgh and later Cambridge, where he was presented with the prestigious Smithrsquos Prize.In , Maxwell was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College, but he chose toto Scotland sue to his Fatherrsquos ill-health.He later developed his theory of electromagnetism, which showed that light was electromagnetic radiation. The theory is considered to have paved the way for both quantum mechanics and Einsteinrsquos theory of special relativity.Maxwell died in  after developing abdominal cancer, the disease which had killed his mother  years earlier.The Dyakonov-Voigt study, published in the Royal Societyrsquos physical sciences research journal, was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council and the US National Science Foundation."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10363962.jpg?type=article-full","title":"government-loses-working-majority-ex-minister-defects-lib-dems","story":"The pro-remain Bracknell MP, made his move in the House of Commons by walking across the chamber to the Lib Dem benches flanked by two of his new colleagues.It means that opposition MPs now outnumber the Conservative and DUP ranks by one solitary MP.

This court and these petitioners were being actively misled.\"He argued the real reason to suspend Parliament was to allow a no-deal Brexit to take place by removing proper scrutiny.Mr ONeill also said Mr Johnson was trying to govern as an \"autocracy\" using \"one-man rule\" by these attempts.He added: \"Why were these specic dates chosen  Its because they think theyre gaming the system.\"It was argued decisions in two separate Brexit-related court cases, brought by activist Gina Miller and Andy Wightman MSP, show Parliament should decide whether or not the UK leaves without a deal.Mr ONeill said it was not lawful to create circumstances where that happens without such approval.David Johnston QC, representing the Government, said the arguments were \"academic\" as it was not for the courts to decideParliament can be prorogued.Mr Johnston said: \"The issues these petitioners raise are political issues, political questions, and their resolution must be found in the political arenas.\"Its true to say that accountability is an important aspect on which the constitution relies.\"But accountability to the courts is not the only form of accountability.He added: \"The proper forum for these matters to be scrutinised is the political forum.\"Those who make decisions that dont go down well in the political forum will be held to account there - either in Parliament or, ultimately, by the electorate.\"Judge Lord Doherty said he hoped to announce his decision on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"tory-turmoil-deepens-former-minister-philip-lee-defects-liberal-democrats","story":"The dramatic move made the Prime Ministerrsquos task of rallying Conservative colleagues to his cause all the harder after he spent much of the day trying to convince some of them not to rebel in the vote on extending Brexit Day to January .Mr Lee, a former Justice Minister, said the party that he had joined more than  years ago was not the party he was leaving now.\"This Conservative Government is aggressively pursuing a damaging Brexit in unprincipled ways, declared the Berkshire MP, who accused it of deliberately using a strategy of political manipulation, bullying and lies.\"It is putting lives and livelihoods at risk unnecessarily and it is wantonly endangering the integrity of the United Kingdom.

They really do have that lsquoblingrsquo factor. ldquoThese were watches that were not made to be hidden away in a pocket.ldquoThey were worn as jewellery ndash rather like todayrsquos watches.ldquoThe exhibition challenges our assumptions about how clocks and watches were once used.It will include  objects which demonstrate the early age of British clock and watchmaking, when owning a timepiece made of precious metal was considered the ultimate status symbol and only affordable for the very rich.Before the th century, clock and watchmaking was primarily the domain of mainland European makers, many of whom had fled to Britain to escape religious persecution.Ramsay initially worked as a goldsmith in St Andrews before learning the art of watch and clockmaking in France.He is said to have been summoned to London by James VI, where he was appointed Page of the Bedchamber and Groom of the Privy Chamber, as well as Keeper of all His Majestyrsquos Clocks and Watches.ldquoIt appears that a mixture of his clockmaking skills and the politics of James VI looking to surround himself with Scots led to his appointment as Page of the Bedchamber, said Dr Phillipson.ldquoThe job description suggests rather menial work but it was a hugely important political role and meant he had direct access to the King.ldquoWhenever he wanted to escape his Privy Council, he would go to his bedchamber, where he surrounded himself with Scots.While th-century watch and clockmakers often worked in silver and gold, most pieces were melted down and their cases recycled, meaning that precious few remain from the era.The exhibition, which will open at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh early next month, will focus on how the horologistrsquos skill and art developed, telling the story of the scientic and technical advances during periods of extreme turmoil.Examples range from early wrought iron clocks made by blacksmiths to the invention of the pendulum clock and the balance spring which improved accuracy to within a few seconds a day.It will also spotlight some of the collaborations between important makers, and the first example of mass-produced watches, made in the early th century by Thomas Tompion, the ldquoFather of English Clockmaking, who used subcontractors to make the parts and movements of his watches.They were then completed in his workshop by a team of apprentices, with around , eventually rolling off his production line.Despite their grand age, most of the timepieces in the display are in working order and there are plans to show some in operation at selected periods during the exhibition.Dr Taylor is said to have become fascinated with watches while watching his father take one apart and rebuild it at the family dining table.He conceived and funded several public clocks, including the Corpus Clock on the outside of the Taylor Library at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge University, which has no hands or numerals and instead shows the time by opening gaps in the clock face.Dr Phillipson said: ldquoClocks and watches were the first manufactured mechanical objects and itrsquos great to show some early examples in the National Museum of Scotland. ldquoThe innovation produced by these wonderful articles initiated the necessity to protect the intellectual property behind their development ndash something that we take for granted today."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-launches-bid-get-drivers-take-bus","story":"The First Minister made a ldquoScottish green deal the centrepiece of

encouraged.Other legislation will allow charges on single-use coffee cups.The  bills in the Programme for Government - also included measures to tackle hate crime, empower councils to levy a ldquotourist tax, deliver an overdue reform of defamation law and create a new system for compensating victims of historic sexual abuse in care homes.Other announcements included the acceleration of a new devolved benefit intended to lt , children out of relative poverty.The pound-a-week payment for low-income families will be brought forward from early  to December  for under-s, and from  to  for

fire last month.However, it was the green measures, many long-term, which Ms Sturgeon emphasised.She said: ldquoThis Programme for Government will put health, prosperity and wellbeing at its heart and will reinforce Scotlandrsquos place as a dynamic, open, innovative economy.ldquoEarlier this year, I acknowledgedthat Scotland - like the rest of the world - faces a climate emergency.ldquoWe are now committed to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by  at the latest - earlier than any other UK nation. This programme is an important part of our response to the climate emergency, containing measures which will reduce emissions while supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.ldquoIt sets out actions which will make a dference for years to come. It meets the challenges of the future, while staying true to our enduring values.The Scottish Greens said the programme was a ldquocheap imitation of their own plans for a new Green Deal to put carbon reduction at the heart of Scotlandrsquos economy.MSP Patrick Harvie said: ldquoMs Sturgeonrsquos version lacks the ambition, scale and courage required of an emergency response.ldquoWe welcome her adoption of the idea that the Scottish Investment Bank should prioritise the climate emergency, but the funding is limited.ldquoThis is not system change. The Scottish Government also seem infatuated with consumer choice and unproven technologies that apparently promise a quick fix - carbon capture and storage, electric aeroplanes and hydrogen trains ndash yet the technology we need to solve the climate crisis is already here.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said he welcomed climate change being ldquowoven into every aspect of government.Dr Richard Dixon of Friends of the Earth Scotland said: ldquoThis package includes some very welcome commitments but is not nearly enough to address the desperate climate emergency the world is facing.ldquoThe obvious contradiction at the heart of this Programme is its commitment to some new measures in transport, heating and agriculture while continuing to back the offshore oil and gas industry to keep on drilling and destroying our climate.David Liddell, CEO of the Scottish Drugs Forum, said the pound extra for treatment services would be welcomed across the drugs field.He said: ldquoFor decades drug treatment services have operated as Cinderella services. We look forward to seeing this money invested and used to drive improvement in services in terms of access and retention that follows the evidence base.John Dickie, Director of the Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, said: ldquoToo many families are struggling now to simply provide the basic necessities for their children so itrsquos great that introduction of the new Scottish Child Payment is being brought forward.

Its CEO is Shona McLennan, who explains that like many minority languages Gaelic has been in decline, but the mission of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig is to promote Gaelic language, Gaelic education, and Gaelic culture with a view to reinvigorating the language.ldquoOne of the most effective ways to do this is to provide education in the medium of the language, says Shona. ldquoAlongside education in the language, pupils also need opportunities to use it outside of the classroom. You need activity around the learning such as sports activities, arts and music.As Jim Whannel, Board Member of Bograverd na Gagraveidhlig and Oraidiche Teaching Fellowat the University of Edinburgh, explains, parents in Scotland are fortunate to have an education system where, from Primary One, they can choose education through the medium of Gaelic or the medium of English.ldquoItrsquos a choice that is available in a large number of authorities, he says. ldquoWhen parents make the choice of the Gaelic medium, they will educate a child in two languages. Itrsquos not an issuethe family doesnt have Gaelic, because theres an immersion programme and something in region of % of the children being taught in the Gaelic medium in Glasgow and Edinburgh come from homes where it isnrsquot spoken.There is also criticism levelled that Gaelic learning and education is for the middle-classes, the elite. Again, the figures extinguish that myth.ldquoThe Glasgow Gaelic School Sgoil Ghagraveidhlig Ghlaschu has a very mixed intake, adds Shona McLennan. ldquoIt serves a very broad community in the city. Itrsquos also one of the highest performing state schools in Scotland.Monolingualism isnrsquot the norm across most of the world, and the benefits of being bilingual or multilingual are well-known , but what is emerging is the solid cognitive benefits to learning other languages, but more importantly using other languages.Thomas Bak is a Reader in Psychology at the University of Edinburgh, with particular interest in the interaction between bilingualism and cognitive s, particularly in diseases such as dementia or stroke.Among the many studies he has conducted was one to test whether there can be improvement in cognitiveby learning a new language.ldquoWe needed to test before and after, he says. ldquoWe compared those learning a language with those learning another subject such as history. We looked at attention switching, counting numbers up and down and after a year there was no dferent but after four years there was a marked dference, with the language students performing better.Thomas also saw this in intensive language courses, when he went to the Gaelic college on Skye, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig and tested students at the beginning and end of the course.ldquoWe saw that one week is enough to improve performance, but it needs to be maintained by five or more hours a week in practice using the language. Those who didnrsquot maintain it, went back to their original performance.Thomas adds that the language itself is irrelevant. ldquoWhat is relevant to Gaelic, however, is that the cognitive advantages are not dependent on the number of speakers. One argument commonly used against Gaelic. Is that itrsquos a small language and most speak English anyway.ldquoIf we look at the analogy of going to the gym, that does us good. Thatrsquos learning the language. However,we drive there rather than cycle or walk, it does us less good. The walking and cycling are using that language.Jim Whannel sees bilingualism as an opportunity to have a more global view and rather than Gaelic medium education being insular, itrsquos actually English medium education which is more closed off.ldquoIn Scotland we have this fantastic opportunity to validate and promote an indigenous culture along with English language culture.Of course there are benefits the learning the language without that immersion. The increased awareness of the language from a young age and understanding can often translate into a desire to carry on and learn more as an adult.As Shona McLennan explains there are still challenges. ldquoLike teaching in English-medium there is a shortage of teachers. We also need to expand the curriculum, so that that pupils who come through Gaelic-medium in primary arenrsquot restricted in subject choices when they come to secondary.ldquoThere are so many benefits but the Gaelic language is a fundamentally important part of Scotlandrsquos culture and heritage."},{"url":null,"title":"former-scottish-labour-spin-doctor-work-scottish-tories","story":"Paul Sinclair,who was chief adviser to Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont from to , is in talks aboutworking as an external consultant for his old rivals.It is understood he agreed in principle to work for Ruth Davidson while she was Scottish Tory leader, but willnow work alongside her replacement.:The inside story of Lamonts downfallHowever there was confusion around the appointment, with the party saying Mr Sinclair was starting work immediately, and Mr Sinclair sayingit had not been finalised.A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: ldquoPaul Sinclair will join the Scottish Conservatives on a consultancy basis.ldquoThis is about stepping up our preparations for the  Holyrood elections, and ensuring Scotland remains a central part of a successful United Kingdom.If his hiringis confirmed, Mr Sinclairwould work on Scottish Torycommunication strategy in the run up to the  Holyrood election.Mr Sinclair, , who currently works as a management consultant, is a close friend of the current head of communications for the Scottish Conservatives, Eddie Barnes.A party source confirmed Mr Sinclairrsquos recruitment had raised eyebrows given his Labour roots, but said he was also known as a committed supporter of the Union.Since leaving his role with Scottish Labour, Mr Sinclair has also been a frequent critic of Jeremy Corbyn as a newspaper columnist.After the  general election, Mr Sinclair accepted a place on the low-tax commission set up by Ms Davidson.:Former Labour spin-doctor joins Tory tax commissionAsked at the timetaking part meant he was a crypto-Tory, he said: ldquoNonsense.

The vast majority of referendums are post-legislative referendums where a Bill has gone through Parliament, and then therersquos a proposal to put that to a referendum, so they donrsquot circumvent Parliament.ldquoAnd so for the Parliament here to allow itself to be cut out of the process, I think would be highly undesirable.Justin Fisher, professor of political science at Brunel University London, who was also giving evidence, said he agreed entirely.SNP MSP Tom Arthur later suggested this language was too strong, and argued any move to hold a referendum would be scrutinised.But Dr Renwick insisted ldquoprocesses of primary legislation exist for a reason.He said: ldquoA decision to hold a referendum is a major decision, and therefore it seems to me that it should be subject to the greatest level of scrutiny within the representative system.ldquoAnd I donrsquot think any form of scrutiny of secondary legislation matches the scrutiny that is given to primary legislation.ldquoIf it did, what would be the point of doing it through secondary legislation, rather than through primary legislation.ldquoIt seems to me that the reason for doing it through secondary legislation is that itrsquos easier to do.ldquoBut that isnrsquot how the representative system is set up.ldquoThe representative system is set up to have checks and balances, and there is a long history in less healthy democracies, and in non-democracies, of using referendums in order for a strong leader to get round parliaments.ldquoScotland should not be going there.

For an insight we spoke to Matthew Clark, Regional Director of Orion Grouprsquos Permanent and Interim recruitment isions in the UK and also Managing Director of its specialist Executive Search ision.Q: Could you give us an insight into the process of recruiting at ious levels for organisations ldquoThe first thing we do is ensure that we meet the hiring manager and the key decision makers within the organisation to map out the skillsets and experience required for each role. Itrsquos very important that we get a full understanding of the job brief before we do anything and itrsquos also equally important that we get under the skin of the company to get a real feel for the culture. At this stage, itrsquos also important to rein in and manage expectations. Itrsquos a highly candidate driven market at the moment and candidates are more passive in their job search than they ever have been. The perfect candidate who ticks all the boxes is extremely rare or is very dficult to engage and attract. We work out the lsquomust-haversquo attributes, then begin the work to find candidates that match the desired specication.Whenever possible and depending upon the type of business we are recruiting for, there are occasions when we will spend a day on site with the employer which enables us to be a true partner when searching for senior iniduals to join their business.\"Given the seniority of roles at executive level, there is often a high level of business sensitivity surrounding each assignment. This can lead to the recruitment process being highly confidential for a iety of reasons. There have been many cases when we havenrsquot been in a position to disclose the name of the employer until the very last minute, perhaps once the candidate has been invited for interview. At this stage we would ask each candidate to sign a non-disclosure agreement in order to protect confidentiality but generally a fair amount of discretion is required from all concerned and senior candidates too expect their application to be treated with the very strictest of confidence.\"Our conversations with the organisation before we commence any assignment can also involve salary benchmarking to assess how competitive their salary and benefits package is in comparison to other similar roles or their competitors.\" Matthew Clark, Regional Director of Orion Grouprsquos Permanent and Interim recruitment isions in the UKQ: What would the starting point for a targeted headhunt be \"The starting point is for us to work in close partnership with our resourcing team and the employer organisation to map out the candidate marketplace and discuss and agree specic target organisations where specic candidates will be working at the moment. It is also key that the candidates we headhunt generally have very specic experience and are obviously at the required level of seniority for the role that we are recruiting.\"Our extensive networks we have built up over the last  years allow us to source candidate recommendations from people we trust. This is what dferentiates us. After that the traditional methods of active database searches and job boards would also be employed to ensure that all sources have been fully utilised.\"Q: Are there certain criteria that you look for in senior candidates \"The obvious one is leadership qualities and we also look for positivity and a can-do attitude, backed by experience ndash that can be a powerful combination.The chance for candidates to increase their earning potential and progress their career needs to be also matched by their desire to embrace the challenge thatrsquos on offer. No matter what business discipline the role falls under it is generally always a key pre-requisite that senior candidates have a wealth of PL management. Undoubtedly, senior candidates must have the necessary gravitas and credibility to lead and influence their people. Itrsquos also vital that they have a proven track record and an ability to drive change, as this can very often be the key reason why they are being brought in to do the role.\"Q: How do you go about identying or assessing exceptional talent in candidates \"Technology has advanced but the ldquohuman element of physically meeting each candidate always has and always will be the best way to assess how talented and experienced an inidual is. As part of the executive search process we often use psychometric assessments or personality profiling to probe deeper into an inidualrsquos capability and behaviours. Before we start each assignment, we also discuss a range of key questions or competency based interview questions with the employer so that we can really draw out exactly what strengths they are looking for from each candidate.\"Q: What additional tools are available on the market to facilitate and support recruitment assignments \"The emergence of ious technologies in our industry has been amazing over the last few years. Robotics and automation are making a meaningful impact in the field of recruitment and there are certain parts of the recruitment process that lend themselves to automation. Articial Intelligentrecruitment software is being talked about a great deal at the moment and is perhaps worth considering for certain recruitment processes and for certain roles. I get contacted every other day about all sorts of new and emerging technology products and recruitment software, the most common being video interviewing software. There are some really great video interviewing tools on the market at the moment and it can be a very useful tool to further assess candidates at the front end of the recruitment process. Again, some instances of use are better than others and not every candidate is comfortable answering questions in front of the camera!\"NURTURING TALENTOrion Group also goes to great s to nurture talent within its own business and also look after staff wellbeing. Over the Grouprsquos  year history, there has been substantial changes in the workplace, particularly when it comes to positive mental health and well-being at work, so Employee Welfare management is an area that Orion has been investing in. ldquoIf our employees are happy, they will be productive, but that can only be achieved by treating them well, adds Mr Clark. ldquoIf we succeed at this as an organisation, we can be of greater help in advising clients on what they can do to retain employees.Studies have shown that the more inclusive and erse a company is, the greater potential for success. The wider a company spreads the net across age, genders, religious beliefs, and race, the better they perform, as the best minds and values propel these companies to the top of their industries.ldquoOrion Grouprsquos own mental health study has shown that we are typically very happy with our working environment, adds Mr Clark.As in any high-pressure workplace, managing time and meeting deadlines are consistent forms of pressure but with high levels of self-direction, work satisfaction, and consultation there is strong support for Orion Group to continue promoting mental wellbeing.An encouraging figure of more than % of employees at Orion believe that colleagues and management would provide supportthey had problems with mental health.Of course there are improvements to be made and Orion is continuing the promotion of mental wellbeing, with a working group set up to represent all UK offices. This can be done in relatively simple ways such as promoting policies where there are low levels of awareness.This can be advice on workstation health or making sure that employees know about perks such as the AON discount scheme. It can also make more effort to ensure that available support is much more visible. Reviewing flexible working arrangements is important, as is making sure that employees have support on managing time and deadlines.ldquoHealthy employees work better, says Linda Dickson, Group HR Director at Labeyrie Food Group ldquoit is well recognised that breaks and taking part in other activities help people to achieve their potential.ldquoMore is expected of employers in terms of flexible working hours and welfare at work - and looking at LinkedIn and Glassdoor we have seen that employees are happy to share the positive experiences they have had at Orion Group.A key to retention, Orion believes, is role validation. Managing career paths and providing career management for clients and candidates over the long term.ldquoWe do things dferently at Orion. The flat management structure drives a collaborative, team culture, adds Michael Downes, Divisional Manager for Orion Groups Procurement and Supply Chain ision.ldquoWe also learned from our beginnings in the oil and engineering industry. Contractors would work with us for many years, so we built relationships with oil majors who would keep coming back for more people. We have used what we learned at that time in the expansion into Permanent, Interim, and Executive Search."},{"url":null,"title":"most of us favour glass being included in deposit return scheme","story":"The vast majority of people in Scotland say that glass should be included in the p Deposit Return Scheme, according to new figures from Zero Waste Scotland.A YouGov survey commissioned by Zero Waste Scotland shows that  per cent of people in Scotland say glass bottles should be in the scheme. Only eight per cent say they should not be included.Under the recycling scheme, people will pay a p deposit when buying drinks in a plastic or glass bottle or a metal can. They will get their money back when theythem to be recycled.The polling is published by Zero Waste Scotland alongside new online content that helps to make clear the benefits of including glass in the scheme. The scheme is expected to increase the recycling of glass bottles from around  per cent at present to  per cent. Including glass makes a substantial contribution to the environmental benefits of the scheme.Zero Waste Scotland calculates that the inclusion of glass in Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme will cut the country’s carbon emissions by . million tonnes over the next  years. This makes up nearly a third of the total anticipated carbon savings of the scheme.Jill Farrell, chief operating officer at Zero Waste Scotland, said: “The environmental evidence shows why Scotland is right to include glass in its depositscheme from day one.“People in Scotland want glass to be included in Scotland’s Deposit Return Scheme as part of ambitious action to protect our environment. “Every bottle recycled rather than sent to landfill means carbon savings. At a time of a climate emergency, this is an unmissable opportunity to cut tens of thousands of tonnes of carbon.”Glass bottles are a big part of Mark Hazell’s beer business.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A record  nominations were received for this years Best Park competition, of which  were in Scotland.\"  Aden Park is Much Loved by public viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"FRAS | Article Teaser\"The founder of Jaw Brewwants to see as much glass recycled as possible and believes the p deposit on glass bottles will help make that happen.“Jaw Brew has always put the environment at the core of what we do so anything that helps make our materials more sustainable is a definite plus for us,” he said. “I lived in Germany for many years so saw how successful depositschemes can be and it’s great that Scotland is set to introduce its own scheme.”"},{"url":null,"title":"20 of the most unusual baby names chosen in 2018","story":"These are some of the most unusual baby names parents in England and Wales named their children in , according to the Office for National Statistics data..

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Local charity the Blide Trust put a lot of work into ensuring the gardens are kept up to a high standard and are a peaceful and welcoming place to relax and rewind in. Sadly, there seems to be an ongoing problem of anti-social behaviour in the gardens.“If people hear or see something and are concerned, please noty the police immediately.

The devices were first introduced in Tayside in June this year and they were subsequently introduced in the North East in July.The mobiles will provide apps enabling officers carry out checks and file crime reports. Officers will also be able to type statements directly to the device through the use of its digital notebookPronto which will obtain an electronic signature from victims and witnesses.Chief Superintendent George Macdonald, Highland and Islands isional commander, said: #The introduction of mobile technology is a major milestone which will positively enhance the operational policing approach in the Highland and Islands.#Over the last two years, we have seen a signicant investment and upgrade in our IT systems to enable us to take advantage of technology.#Given the geography of the area, officers do incur signicant travel time between calls and their stations, the mobile device will allow officers to be more visible in the community, spend more time on patrol and hopefully be more accessible within the areas they serve.#Members of the public will see police officers operating their mobile device in public areas. It is important they understand they are not using their personal telephone and that they are working, but be reassured they will always be available to offer help, advice or assistanceneeded.#Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Humza Yousaf  is pleased that the Scottish Government has been able to help Police Scotland invest in new mobile technology, which he believes will enable officers to work in the heart of Scotland’s communities, providing reassurance and increasing their visibility.“This technology is enabling officers to become even more agile and responsive, ensuring the service is better-equipped to meet the modern-day demands upon it,# he said.#Being able to access information at their fingertips will improve the ability of officers in the Highlands and Islands to react promptly to a range of issues they encounter, enhancing the amount of time available to spend in the heart of their communities and keeping people safe.”Susan Deacon, Chair of the Scottish Police Authorityfeels that this is an important and much needed step forward.#The introduction of mobile working will bring real benefits to the police and the public and will make the police service more responsive, visible and efficient,# she explained.#Continued investment in technology is vital to ensure that policing in Scotland keeps pace with changing needs and demands. Communities across Scotland will be better protected as a result of these changes.#The £million Mobile Working Project which was part funded by the Scottish Government’s capital budget allocation will see approximately , of Police Scotland’s unormed officers issued with mobile devices by spring .The devices will be further enhanced over time with the addition of future policing applications, including national systems as they become available.Last year, Police Scotland produced a business case for a major investment in digital, data and ICT over  years to modernise the service. The proposed investment would also generate savings and public service improvements for the wider criminal justice system justice system.David Wallace, BT’s public sector director in Scotland and chair of the BT board in Scotland, said: “We’re pleased to be leading this project, bringing in our EE mobile network – the largest G network in the UK – and our unrivalled resources to help Police Scotland transform the way they work.“By helping our customers take advantage of BT’s investments in innovations and networking, including our launch of G in Scotland, we’ll see opportunities we couldn’t imagine ten years ago come into our lives.”Norman Dixon, Motorola Solutions# Account Director for Scotland added: “The Pronto mobile application replaces the paper notebook and modernises police workflows by giving them access to databases and tools on their mobile device on the beat. It is a world-leading mobile solution for policing. It was developed here in Scotland in partnership with the police service, so it is fantastic to see that it will become available to , Police Scotland officers.“We look forward to working with Police Scotland and are proud to be part of this major milestone in mobile police technology.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Craig Clouston and Callan Jessiman were tasked with anchoring the midfield for Hotspurs, while Rovers lined up in a --, spearheaded by Steven Tulloch and Zack Singh.The opening stages were cagey, as the two teams felt each out. The big talking point of the opening half hour was an agricultural challenge by Scott Drever in the Rovers midfield. He went over the top of the ball on Jordan Low in the middle of the park, an offence referee Mike Cursiter saw fit to issue a caution to the midfielder, with Hotspurs looking for a red.Aiden Drever saw a free-kick go narrowly wide of Davy Leonard#s post after  minutes, while Tulloch might have done better with a half chance just before the half-time whistle. A driven ball from Graeme Horne on the left was nodded on by Singh, but the veteran Rovers striker couldn#t direct his header on target, with Hotspurs appealing for an offside flag.The match remained goalless at the break, with neither team having really got going.The match was soon to kick into le in the second half. After  minutes, Rovers ‘keeper Liam Valentine made a hash of a clearance, booting the ball against Spurs striker Jerry McBeth. With the goal gaping, the Hotspurs striker was just about to pull the trigger when he was tripped by Valentine.Cursiter awarded the free-kick, and after a long consultation with his linesman, deemed the challenge worthy of a yellow card only, despite the protestations of the away side. Joe Wilson#s effort from the set piece was tipped wide by the ‘keeper.Just before the hour mark, Rovers saw their best chance come and go. A long ball found Connan Rendall on the right, who controlled it wonderfully before shuffling inside to the edge of the box. His drilled effort looked every inch a goal until Leonard flung himself down to his left to tip it round the post.Moments later, the breakthrough was to come at the other end, as the match swung from end-to-end.Aiden Drever was penalised for a foul on Logan Peace wide on Hotspurs left. The free-kick was flighted in but cleared out to Joe Wilson. His cross back in found Hotspurs legend Wayne Monkman at the back post, whose header floated over the stranded Valentine for the opening goal. Could Monkman#s goal be the fairytale ending for the defender on his final Hotspurs appearance Rovers now needed to score twice in the last  minutes to win the title, but in truth they found a well-marshalled away defence dficult to break down. Hotspurs had the bit between their teeth, with a first ‘A’ League title since  now tantalisingly close.The hosts# task was made even more challenging when Aiden Drever was sent off for two bookings in quick succession with  minutes to go. From there, Hotspurs saw out the game relatively comfortably.In the th minute, Valentine got caught underneath a high ball into the box, dropping it at the feet of substitute Jack Paterson. As the sub tried to get a shot away, he was impeded by the Rovers goalie, who saw his second yellow card of the evening to ensure his side would finish with nine men.Seventeen-year-old midfielder Jessiman stepped up to coolly slot away the resultant penalty, ensuring Hotspurs would win the  ‘A’ League, and sparking scenes of delight amongst their support on the sidelines.OAFA president Colin MacLeod paid tribute to both sides for a hard-fought league campaign after the match, and invited up Hotspurs skipper Keith Harcus to receive the Brough Cup for his side.Harcus — standing in for the injured Owen Rendall — paid tribute to his centre-back partner Monkman who is set to bow out of domestic football as an ‘A’ League champion and urged his teammates not to go another  years before landing the biggest prize in domestic football.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The ldquosignicant discovery, made in the Wem area of Shropshire last year, included a brooch thought to have been used to pin together a cloth or leather bag when the hoard was buried during the Dark Ages.Shropshire coroner John Ellery was told the haul ndash only the sixth hoard of Roman hacksilver found in Britain ndash was located by Steve Lord, Steve King and Andy Bijsterbosch after they detected a handful of coins in a ploughed field.Mr Ellery ruled that the original find, and more silver objects identied during a follow-up dig last week, constituted a single hoard of treasure.The coins and the other items should be known as the Wem Hoard, said Mr Ellery, who was told that experts at the British Museum were involved in assessing and examining the items. --\"Halved coins found near Wem in Shropshire--Peter Reavill, finds liaison officer for Shropshire and Herefordshire with the British Museumrsquos Portable Antiquities Scheme, told the inquest it was hoped the items could be acquired for display in Shropshire.He told the hearing some of the coins had been chiselled into halves and quarters, as the collapse of the monetary system following ldquothe Roman Brexit meant they only retained value as silver bullion.Pieces of silver cups and plates were found cut into smaller pieces, also of apparent use as a form of payment.Speaking after the inquest, Mr Reavill said: ldquoThis hoard was discovered last summer by three metal detectorists that reported it to my colleague.ldquoThat hoard is the largest hacksilver Roman hoard we have from the West Midlands. It contains both hacked-up vessels and brooches and buckles, but it also includes a number of Roman coins from the very end of the Roman Empire.ldquoAnalysis which has been done at the British Museum suggests that it goes in the ground in the fth century ndash  to AD.ldquoWe know at that time that the monetary system in Britain has completely collapsed and we are based on a sort of bullion ndash the weight of the silver in the coins and the objects.ldquoThatrsquos been hacked up and put into very small pieces so that it can be paid out to people like mercenaries to protect you, but also to traders.ldquoThe Romans traditionally leave Britain in AD and thatrsquos seen as the Roman Brexit, as it were ndash we are at a point where that whole Roman system has collapsed, and the only way that you can go and spend money is by hacking up the old coinage and weighing it in to buy products from abroad, but also to pay people to protect you.ldquoSo these fragments of silver vessels and things no longeras an object but have turned into money.ldquoThat period is known as the Dark Ages, and in Shropshire and the West Midlands we have very few objects of that sort of date, so this hoard is absolutely a really important thing.ldquoWithout these metal detectorists we wouldnrsquot have known anything about that period in this part of Shropshire.Experts believe the hoard was probably deposited for recovery at a later date near a marker stone or a tree.Mr King, from Ashton, near Chester, told the PA news agency he was searching with Mr Lord, from Abergele in Wales, and Mr Bijsterbocsh, who lives in Blackpool, when they discovered around half a dozen coins on the surface.The -year-old, a retired supermarket manager, said: ldquoIt was a rally organised by a friend. We had been saying that on our wish-list was a silver Roman coin.ldquoThe guy organising the rally, John Parry, said he felt on the farthest part of the site there was a good opportunity of finding something.ldquoStevefound the first Roman silver coin in front of me, which was extraordinary. We were both looking at it and then I found one about two foot away on the floor as well.ldquoWe found a couple more and then Andy joined us and we ended up finding about six or seven coins around the surface.ldquoI had a listen and there was definitely something there ndash but obviously deeper.ldquoWe dug down a couple of feet and we ended up sort of putting my hand in ndash and literally coming up with handfuls of silver, including the brooch, including some ringshellip bits of cut silver.ldquoIt was just incredible.copy -.

There was a time when most of us had no doubt at all about what we should or should not do. We were told what was done or not done. There were Commandments. There were oaths administered by the scouting and guiding movements. There were role models to look up to. There was the expectation that politicians who lied were expected to fall upon their swords, or at least resign. Today, serial mendacity in a politician seems to be disregarded – indeed it might even propel one into high office. Remember Mr Profumo, who after uttering one untruth went off in voluntary exile to do good works in the East End of London for decades before he was welcomed back into respectable society. His exclusion today would be for an afternoon – at the most. O tempora, o mores is the muttered refrain of those who observe how things have changed.And yet, in spite of this seismic sht in the landscape of public le, there are still subtle moral issues that confront us in the leading of our day-to-day lives. One of these is the question of how far we should restrain ourselves in our curiosity as to how our friends and neighbours conduct their lives. How others live is, after all, a subject of abiding interest to most of us, and yet at the same time we are usually aware of at least some restraints on how much we should try to find out about others.: Alexander McCall Smith: Forget Brexit, we should argue about this insteadFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereTake the case of conversations in a restaurant or coffee bar. Should you listen to what is being said at neighbouring tables, or should you deliberately close your ears to conversations to which you have not been formally admitted  These conversations are often fascinating, andyou are by yourself at a table, then the temptation to listen is in almost irresistible. And yet that is an act of intrusion – a form of eavesdropping, which is generally regarded as unacceptable. If one would not listen at a keyhole, then surely the same must be said for other situations where one attempts to hear what is being said.The dference, of course, might lie in implicit consent. If you conduct a conversation in a public place, then you might be said to consent to others hearing what you have to say. Indeed, an argument might be made to the effect that it is wrong to conduct any form of sensitive conversation in public as you have no means of knowing whether those about you actually want to hear what you have to say.A iation on this is the mobile phone conversation. The frustrating thing about such conversations is that we overhear only one side, and again it is not the eavesdropper who is being rude – it is the person on the phone who is showing discourtesy. The polite thing – indeed the right thing – to doyou are having a telephone conversation in public, is to switch to speakerphone mode so that those about you can hear what the other person is saying. Quiet coaches are all very well, but there is a strong case for noisy coaches too, in which those using their mobiles would be obliged to plug them into a public address system so that everyone in the coach can hear both sides of the conversation. That, in my view, is common courtesy.Now for a tricky one. In Edinburgh, where we have a very advanced recycling culture, every householder is given a blue plastic box into which empty bottles and jars can be put out for collection. These come with a frilly plastic cover that can be stretched out over the top of the box, thereby making it impossible for prying eyes to see what is inside. In reality, most people lose these quickly and therefore put out their boxes without any cover. That means thatyou walk along the street you can see exactly what your neighbours have been drinking. This is very interesting information – irresistible to most . But it really is very interesting to count the number of whisky bottles or check up on the vintage of the recycled bottles. And champagne ... who would imagine that so much champagne is consumed in the EH postal code  However, most of the empty bottles I have seen have been very cheap brands.As to other bins left out by neighbours, some people like to look into the food recycling bins that the council provides. Again, that is not something that should be countenanced. Food waste is private, and it is no business of ours what other people consume, fascinating though it may be. Of course that recycling effort is particularly laudable, and those councils – such as Edinburgh – that provide that facility deserve the highest praise. Many people do not know, of course, that the waste in those little grey bins is taken off to a secret council location and processed into food for students. Students don’t know that, I believe, but I am sure that they would be unlikely to object. After all, those who were students some time ago remember the rubbish we ate and it is hard to imagine that this reprocessed food waste is any worse. In fact, it might be healthier. Looking into the recycling bins of neighbours is undoubtedly an unacceptable intrusion, on a par, perhaps, with the reading of people’s postcards. Hold on, you say – a postcard is specically designed not to be confidential: it is an inherently open communication. I am not convinced of that. Admire the picture, yes, but do not read what is written on the other side, or,you must, give it only the quickest of glances.The moral le is not simple. However, nobody can go wrongthey accept the principle of Kant’s Categorical Imperative. That is an idea that has been recycled many times, but remains as powerful today as it was when Kant first recycled it. More of that another time – or times perhaps. ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"looking back when a young jacob rees mogg campaigned in scotland with his nanny","story":"The Scotsman recalls his first foray into Scottish politics.Brexit campaigner Jacob Rees-Mogg started his political career back in Rees-Mogg was just  when he was selected by the Conservatives to contest Central Fe ndash a traditional Labour seat ndash at the  general election.The Etonian travelled to Scotland with a mind to hitting the campaign trail, but his upper-class background soon put him at odds with a largely working-class electorate.The son of late Times editor William, Rees-Mogg made the inauspicious decision to knock on doors in the former mining town of Leven on the Fe coast.But reports quickly emerged of the English candidate taking the familyrsquos nanny, Veronica Crook, in tow during canvassing while driving around the back streets of Fe in a Bentley.Rees-Mogg turned into cannon fodder, particularly for the tabloid newspapers.He was photographed in a pin-stripe suit visiting the doors of constituents in the Broom estate in Leven.Declarations by Rees-Mogg that people on benefits were the ldquoscourge of the earth didnrsquot help his position.Adding to his back story were reports of Rees-Mogg having to be saved by his Labour opponent Henry McLeish from being beaten up.McLeish told the Daily Record earlier this year: ldquoAt one point, somebody threatened to come onto the  and beat him up.ldquoA touching part to that was that after saving him from a potential duffing up, his father, the very distinguished editor of the Times, William Rees-Mogg, sent me a letter thanking me for how Irsquod managed to protect him, for which he was very grateful.Why your new suitable cabin baggage might actually fall foul of Ryanair rulesldquoIt was a delightful letter, basically saying lsquoI donrsquot often write to Labour MPs, but I would like to thank you very, very sincerely for the way you looked after my sonrsquo.ldquoJacob was like a fish out of water and clearly bewildered by places like Methil and Kennoway.ldquoI did not get the feeling he was the dangerous ideologue extremist we know him as today.ldquoHe was reasonably well behaved in my company because I think he was in fear of his le.ldquoThe fact he is looked upon by some as a future Prime Minister seems well beyond the realms of comprehension. I never even thought hersquod ever make it as an MP.Rees-Mogg later claried he had been driving his motherrsquos Mercedes Benz during canvassing ndash and not the Bentley that soon made him a source of public ridicule.ldquoThe nanny bit is right, Rees-Mogg confirmed in .ldquoOf course she came canvassing, shersquos part of the family after all. Shersquos been with us for  years.But despite his family owning two classing Bentleys at the time, the former investment banker stressed: ldquoWe took my motherrsquos Mercedes Estate.ldquoI donrsquot think a Bentleyrsquos a suitable campaigning car. It was the petrol consumption ndash six miles to the gallon.Rees-Mogg, now , would go on to finish a distant third in polling for the electorate, receiving just  per cent of the votes in Central Fe.It would prove a disastrous election in Scotland for the Conservatives.No new Conservative MPs were elected in Scotland that year, with the Tories suffering their worst electoral defeat since . The party lost all its seats in Scotland.Rees-Mogg refused to accept his background was an issue.He said at the time: ldquoNobody says to Tony Blair in Sedgefield lsquoyoursquore Scottish, so what are you doing in an English constituency rsquo. Or to Teddy Taylor in Southend.ldquoI suppose Irsquom Teddy Taylor in reverse.

Matt Aumlkerfeldt worked as Nikolaj Coster-Waldau’sstand in and body double from  to the show’s grand end this year. Caution - Contains spoilersyou haven’t watched the final season yet!Matt applied to be an extra on the show when it first came to Northern Ireland then ended up landing a full on role.“I did a few days of extra work and then got noticed by the casting staff as I bore a resemblance to Nikolaj, who played Jamie Lannister.“Most of my measurements were the same as him, down to even my hand size which was vital from season three as Jamie has his hand cut off. “I worked about  days a year on the show and then during season eight I was there pretty much every day!”In ‘real le’, Matt, who is , loves working in the Fairhill branch of Cafe Nero’s.  Born in Sweden, Matt moved to Northern Ireland when he was a child with his mum. He has adopted the Ballymena area as his home and says Game of Thrones helped keep him here. He explained: “I would get in before all the other cast and crew and have a rough idea of what scenes were going to be shot that day. I’d then go over them with the director and the camera guys plus the director of photography.“I’d be given some direction and then take part in crew rehearsals. After this would be the full rehearsal with all the extras, so by the time the main cast come on set I’ve probably gone through the scene about  times!“Nikolaj would then come on and get some short notes from the director before I’d also give him notes as I’ve already ran the scene. My face is never actually recorded on camera but I’ve been in every one of his scenes. “Working then as a body double was dferent. When doing this I dressed up in the character of Jamie and picked up the shots.“This even applied to the nude scenes, which I was comfortable with as I’m not really a shy person and don’t get nervous easily!”Although it would be practically impossible to tell the dference between Matt and Nikolaj on screen, Matt said: “I know all the scenes I did and,anything, it’s a bit illusion breaking as I also know what’s behind the scene!”So what was Matt’s favourite moment from the whole Game of Thrones season  His answer was the iconic trial of Jamie Lannister in Season .“All the main cast were together,” Matt explained.“On that day Nikolaj got wrapped early so when he’s not on screen all the actors are actually looking at me and I was delivering his lines to them. “I had this amazing line up of actors looking at me. It was a big moment in the whole series and I suppose I was relatively nervous!“When action is called, it’s like your le stops, you’re no longer in this world you feel you’re actually in Westeros. Then when cut is called everyone is back to normal. It’s amazingnot a little weird!”Being a body double meant that Matt wore the original costumes.“I wore Nikolaj’s costume alot, including the armour which is real.“I had to keep my body a certain shape so as to fit it plus I did have to keep pretty fit to carry it.“When we started working with the gold hand, my own arm was strapped behind my back, which was pretty uncomfortable, but the fake arm was amazing. It looked very real, down to the pours and hair on the skin.”It’s no secret that the last season of Game of Thrones was surrounded in secrecy! So how did Matt handle keeping the secret that almost  million people wanted to know He revealed: “I certainly didn’t tell too many people!“For nine years I kept all the secrets of the show and, especially in the last season it really was such a burden as there were so many consperies. It became hard to not talk about it and I really just wanted to tell someone about it.”Many of the ludicrous rumours about how the show would end were indeed , however Matt did confirm that scripts were destroyed after each scene was filmed.He said: “There were hundreds of people in the crew during the last season so it got to the point that sets were closed.“There was also misinformation circulated. One part of the crew would be told a certain detail about a scene or filming while another would be told something , all just to throw people off the scent of what was really going on.  “On one occasion Nikolaj went to Seville just so as people would think he was filming there when infact he wasn’t.”Final EpisodeThe final episode and season was met with much acclaim but it wasn’t without some negative reviews. Many people thought the ending wasn’t as dramatic as should have been, and some were left disappointed.To a certain extent, Matt agrees.“I think there was alot of character progression over the years that was forgotten about or pushed aside during the final season, and perhaps some characters could have had a more gloried end. “Perhaps the writers were concentrating on dferent projects. “My view was that this was the last season, we should have gone all out!”On Jamie’s last scene, where he died under a pile of rubble in the arms of his sister, Matt has his own philosophy.“In my head I’d like to think that Jamie was actually going to kill Cersei so as he could have a proper future with Brienne of Tarth.”Matt talks fondly of all the cast members, especially Nikolaj.He said: “I love Nikolaj. I obviously spent alot of time with him and I went to the wrap party which was great too.Gwendoline Christie, who played Brienne of Tarth was a lovely lady and I was friends with Jacob Anderson who played Greyworm. I got to know everyone well and generally everyone was really nice.” Le after Game of ThronesThe future is certainly bright for Matt as he aspires to get more recognised as an actor.“Currently I’m working at the Game of Thrones exhibition in Belfast and doing some photography work.“I’ve started a series of YouTube videos going round the Thrones locations in Northern Ireland and explaining them.“I recently did a video from Cushendun caves, which is special to me as it’s actually where Nikolaj and I had our last scene together.“From that I was noticed by a writer, currently writing a movie and was sent the script. So I potentially have the opportunity to be part of the main cast for that upcoming movie. “I don’t have an agent as I need a showreel of me infront of the camera, sothis movie works out I’ll get the showreel then hopefully an agent and we’ll see where it goes from there.“I also really want to keep my job in Nero’s as I love it there!”Looking back, Matt had such a great experience working on Thrones.“It was a great nine years! But when it all aired and all the secrets were out I felt really free. It was like a car had been lted off my shoulders as there was so much information I had to keep to myself!”Matt still hasn’t watched the final season on TV.“I still miss it as it was better than anything I’ve worked on before but I’ll watch it at some point, I know what happens at the end of the day!” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2228521.jpg--.jpg?1567156924000\n","title":"j p corry site re opens","story":"Local builders’ merchants, JP Corry, officially reopened its’ Ballymenabranch on Monday th August following a devastating fire that closed the site just  weeks ago.

I have been through the mill many times but I know when I have been treated unfairly.”He continued: “They brought me on to deliberately denigrate everything that I stand for.

As part of his instructions, which he wrote in , £, was each given to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Private Eye investigative journalist Paul Halloran. Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Mr Pence was speaking just moments after the Taoiseach had asked him to bring an understanding of the Good Friday Agreement and the backstop back to Washington. Theof a hard border on this island was described as a \"very real risk\" by Mr Varadkar. He said Brexit could create barriers to north-south co-operation and risk peace. \"We as a government have to stand our ground on the Agreement. All I ask is that you bring that message back to Washington with you. This is not a problem of our making. It is one we want to solve through an orderly Brexit and a withdrawal agreement that guarantees no re-emergence of a hard border on this island,\" Mr Varadkar explained.Sources said the Taoiseach repeatedly explained the Republics attachment to the backstop during a private -minute meeting with Mr Pence. One official said Mr Pence appeared to have a \"good understanding\" of the issues and the Irish Governments \"commitment to the Good Friday Agreement\". But separate sources admitted the comments by Mr Pence were not what they would have hoped for under the circumstances. Mr Pence did acknowledge the \"unique challenges on your northern border\", saying he would encourage the UK and Ireland to ensure that any Brexit deal respects the Agreement.However, he quickly moved on to promise that the US would strike a trade deal with the UK once it is outside the EU. This is a controversial topic in the US, where a number of high-profile Irish American politicians are threatening to block a dealBrexit causes any damage to the Good Friday Agreement. Among those who have publicly committed to stalling a trade deal is House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Civic and business groups last night called on Mrs Pelosi to only back a UK trade deal that protects the Good Friday Agreement.The letter is signed by more than  civil liberty groups, community organisations, trade unionists and representatives of businesses across Northern Ireland. A delegation from the consortium will travel to Washington later this month to outline their concerns to speaker Pelosi and other senior US politicians from the main parties in Congress.In the letter, the groups asked speaker Pelosi to ensure the US Congress scrutinised any future trade deal with the UK \"very carefully to ensure full compliance with the  Agreement\".\"We urge Congress to satisfy itself that the truly transformational foundations for peace and prosperity here, which were laid with the indispensable aid of the United States, are not undermined in any manner by decisions to be taken in Congress,\" the letter said.The groups that have signed the letter include the Committee on the Administration of Justice, the Freight Transport Association , the Human Rights Consortium, Londonderry Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturing NI, Disability Action Northern Ireland, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, NICVA, Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, Retail NI and Unison Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"cache of choppedup romanera silver found in shropshire field","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Peter Reavill, finds liaison officer for Shropshire and Herefordshire with the British Museum’s Portable Antiquities Scheme, told the inquest it was hoped the items could be acquired for display in Shropshire.He told the hearing some of the coins had been chiselled into halves and quarters, as the collapse of the monetary system following “the Roman Brexit” meant they only retained value as silver bullion.Pieces of silver cups and plates were found cut into smaller pieces, also of apparent use as a form of payment.Speaking after the inquest, Mr Reavill said: “This hoard was discovered last summer by three metal detectorists that reported it to my colleague.“That hoard is the largest hacksilver Roman hoard we have from the West Midlands. It contains both hacked-up vessels and brooches and buckles, but it also includes a number of Roman coins from the very end of the Roman Empire.“Analysis which has been done at the British Museum suggests that it goes in the ground in the fth century –  to AD.“We know at that time that the monetary system in Britain has completely collapsed and we are based on a sort of bullion – the weight of the silver in the coins and the objects.“That’s been hacked up and put into very small pieces so that it can be paid out to people like mercenaries to protect you, but also to traders.“The Romans traditionally leave Britain in AD and that’s seen as the Roman Brexit, as it were – we are at a point where that whole Roman system has collapsed, and the only way that you can go and spend money is by hacking up the old coinage and weighing it in to buy products from abroad, but also to pay people to protect you.“So these fragments of silver vessels and things no longeras an object but have turned into money.“That period is known as the Dark Ages, and in Shropshire and the West Midlands we have very few objects of that sort of date, so this hoard is absolutely a really important thing.“Without these metal detectorists we wouldn’t have known anything about that period in this part of Shropshire.”Experts believe the hoard was probably deposited for recovery at a later date near a marker stone or a tree.Mr King, from Ashton, near Chester, told the PA news agency he was searching with Mr Lord, from Abergele in Wales, and Mr Bijsterbocsh, who lives in Blackpool, when they discovered around half a dozen coins on the surface.The -year-old, a retired supermarket manager, said: “It was a rally organised by a friend. We had been saying that on our wish-list was a silver Roman coin.“The guy organising the rally, John Parry, said he felt on the farthest part of the site there was a good opportunity of finding something.“Stevefound the first Roman silver coin in front of me, which was extraordinary. We were both looking at it and then I found one about two foot away on the floor as well.“We found a couple more and then Andy joined us and we ended up finding about six or seven coins around the surface.“I had a listen and there was definitely something there – but obviously deeper.“We dug down a couple of feet and we ended up sort of putting my hand in – and literally coming up with handfuls of silver, including the brooch, including some rings… bits of cut silver.“It was just incredible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"chancellor sajid javids spending round what you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Amongst the pupils at the house which was called Tanus, was a young Samuel Beckett who attended there between the age of five and nine.The school was located on the Leopardstown Road between Foxrock and Stillorgan and in his later years literally giant still recalled that the place had a big lawn where, between classes, he and his brother Frank would play with the other children.Also, whilst they were attending the school, the Beckett’s father acted as a surveyor for a new building that the Elsner’s had constructed at the end of their garden to act as a gymnasium.Having obviously inherited her father’s undoubted musical talent, Alex attended the Royal College of Music in London where she honed her contralto voice and on herto Ireland in  and took part in concerts with many of Dublin’s musical societies and remained an extremely popular choice for private recitals in the fashionable houses of the capital.Later in the s Alexandrina Elsner was travelling north to sing in Belfast and the North West as well. Amongst her first memorable appearances in Derry was a performance as a soloist at a St Columb’s Choral Union concert in February  and at another concert in October  at the city’s new Opera House on Carlisle Road.The stature of the appearance of Miss Elsner at Derry’s Opera House, which had opened in , should not be underestimated since there were very few venues of this stature in Ireland at the time that attracted only the top acts of the time. In fact, the Derry newspapers - the Standard, Derry Journal and Londonderry Sentinel lauded her as one of the most favoured performers of the local audiences.Renowned Italian opera companies regularly visited Derry to perform and such was the popularity of the city’s Opera House that late night train services for audiences were often laid on from Inishowen and in the city late evening tram services allowed audiences to travel more easily to the shows.When she married Abraham Stewart on June ,  Alex Elsner moved to Derry where she wasted no time in throwing herself into the cultural le of a city esteemed for not only for its love of music but its wealth of talent as well.Just two years after her arrival in her new home, Alexandrina had established the Londonderry Philharmonic Society and Londonderry Feis. The Feis, beginning as a single day event on April ,  eventually bloomed into a week-long festival of music and singing by the s and she herself took lead roles in the bi-annual performances of the Philharmonic Society.The budding impresario wisely took counsel from the organisers of the Feis Ceoilin her native city of Dublin and invited a representative to Derry to advise on how to establish a local version. As a result, Derry became the second place in Ireland to establish such a festival, beating Sligoand Belfastto the punch.Initially, there were just a few competitions – for church choirs, factory choirs, school choirs, drum and flute bands, brass bands and for solo singers as well as special medals for songs sung in Gaelic awarded by the Derry branch of the Gaelic League. The interest of budding competitors was immediately taken as the workers of the famed city shirt factories quickly scrambled to form choirs specically for the Feis.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshIn advance of the first year of competition, by February of  three of the factories established four choirs. Welch Margetson  Co and Hogg  Mitchell both entered a choir each, whilst the much larger workforce at Tillie  Henderson entered two choral groups.With the passing decades the Feis gained more and more competitors and its repertoire of competitions expanded as a result not just from all over Ireland but from Scotland and England as well. As its prestige also increased, many of Derry’s businesses were glad to be associated with its success and donated beautul gold and silver cups and medals. Bursary schemes for those intent in pursuing a professional le in music and singing also began.In , just a year after partition, another woman Mrs Edward HenryO’Doherty founded Feis Doire Colmcille along with Fr Joseph McGettigan. The Derry Feis centred more upon Irish music, dancing and singing but despite the obvious cultural dferences, competitors from the Catholic and Protestant communities competed in both feiseanna without exception.Alexandrina Stewarts devotion to the Londonderry Philharmonic Society was equal to her commitment to the feis. Apart from featuring her own distinguished performances, the concerts also featured many distinguished musical names from both London and Dublin.In an era long before manufactured television vehicles, the twice-yearly Derry concerts also attracted talent scouts from far and near seeking bookings for their concert halls and opera houses.And, a major talent was spotted as the result of the Philharmonic Society’s concert in Derry on March , . James Johnston, a native of Belfast was well-known as an amateur singer in his younger days but was practically untrained at the highest level. Instead he concentrated as a career in butchery in his father’s shop and supplemented his income as a semi-professional singer at venues around Ireland.It was after his performance in Derry that he was snapped up by the Dublin Grand Opera Society and so began a huge career as an opera singer. It was after highly memorable performances in Rigoletto in Ireland’s capital in , the globally renowned theatrical director Tyrone Guthrie offered him a contract at Sadler’s Wells where he became principal tenor for well in excess of a decade.During his career Johnston played a wide range of roles which included his Covent Garden debut in La Traviata in  and also appeared with Maria Callas and Joan Sutherland. Johnston retired at the height of his fame in  and simply ed to working in the family butcher’s business in Belfast’s Sandy Row where he lived out the remainder of his le until he died aged  in .Johnston’s success however was entirely based on being spotted in Derry and to the efforts of Alex Stewart’s in establishing the city’s Philharmonic Society. It too sprang from relatively humble beginnings, with having just over  in the chorus and nineteen strong orchestra in . By the s the society accounted for  voices and a  strong orchestra that drew its membership from all classes across Derry.The pinnacle of Alex’s own musical career had perhaps come in March  when she was soloist for the celebrated Halle Orchestra at St Columb’s Hall. The orchestra had been founded in  in Manchester by Sir Charles Halle to perform at the Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition in January . The orchestra exists to this day and has been in residence at the Bridgewater Hall in Manchester since .Abraham Stewart died suddenly in  and as a result, Alexandrina ed home to her family in Dublin, but ed to Derry every year without fail during feis week. The Feis Committee awarded her the honorary title of administrator and offered to pay the fare for herjourney for le.On May ,  Alex McCausland Elsner Stewart died at a nursing home in Dublin and her remains were brought to Derry and buried beside those of her husband in the city cemetery. The couple had two sons and a daughter. Her daughter, also called Alexandrina, had been killed just a few weeks previously whilst on active service in Burma during World War II.Abraham and Alexandrina had lived at the prestigious Crawford Square in Derry and it was there on April ,  that the Ulster History Circle unveiled a blue plaque marking her le and contribution to the cultural le of her adopted city.Commenting on the unveiling of the blue plaque, Chris Spurr from the Ulster History Circle said: “When Alexandrina Stewart embraced Ireland’s city of music, the result was a harmonious partnership founding the first Londonderry Philharmonic Society and the Derry Feis Ceoil.”CAPTION: The Londonderry Philharmonic Society on stage at the Guildhall."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures 39 wall wall sunshine 39","story":"Berriew Show President and grandfather, Mark Bright, presents cup winner in the ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtover s fancy dress ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtto Olivia Jonesfrom Berriew.

Work to widen Fountain Street to provide on-street parking and traffic calming measures has already been completed, while a pound, project at Collinsrsquo Corner is currently underway.Roads officials have previously suggested the introduction of a one-way system but little or nor progress appears to have been made on this particular scheme.While pleased with the work in Fountain Street and Collinsrsquo Corner, Cllr Curran believes they will not have a positive impact on town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with senior roads engineers. He is also concerned that no progress is being made to tackle a congestion and road safety issue at Edward Street in the town.His call for talks to discuss solutions to town centre congestion came ahead of a special meeting between councillors and roads officials last night when the Department of Infrastructure presented its annual report which details work that has already been completed on ious schemes and what projects are in the pipeline.Cllr Curran said the annual report contained no ldquoconcrete proposals for addressing town centre congestion, prompting his call to meet with engineers.ldquoA proposed road between Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue has been shelved due to the cost involved and the minimal impact it would have on tackling congestion, he said. ldquoThat is why we need to get round the table and look at all options moving forward.ldquoCan lessons be learned from other towns which experienced similar problems or what about changing the sequencing of traffic lights  he asked.ldquoIt has been said many times that there is no quick fix solution to Downpatrickrsquos congestion problem and while the layout of the town may pose problems for engineers, surely it is time for some innovative thinking ldquoAll the key players need to get together as years of inaction has exacerbated the congestion nightmare faced by residents, businesses and visitors.Cllr Curran says the time has come to ldquograsp the congestion nettle with the onus on roads officials to finally deliver by taking a critical look at the problems.ldquoWe need to take a critical look at the problem and come up with ideas on the way forward. I suspect that the congestion issue that we have in Downpatrick would not be allowed to go unaddressed in any other major town in the country. We have had numerous reports on the way forward but what people, in particular those in the business community what to see, is action, he continued.ldquoDownpatrick councillors need to join forces and sit down with roads engineers to look at what can be done. Apart from the development of the Saul Way link road, there has been no major traffic development in Downpatrick town centre for decades.ldquoThe congestion problem is getting worse andthe ambitious plans to redevelop the former Irish Street police station base and adjoining buildings are to be a success and attract new commercial and private development, we need to solve the traffic problem.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThe congestion is driving shoppers out of the town and we need to arrest this decline.

That whip has now been withdrawn.“If tonight’s motion had been lost, a no-deal Brexit would have been almost inevitable. Probably not a good career move but the right choice.”A source close to the rebels said: “Tonight’s decisive result is the first step in a process to avert an undemocratic and damaging no-deal.“No  have responded by removing the whip from two former chancellors, a former lord chancellor and Winston Churchill’s grandson.

leader Jeremy Corbyn told the Prime Minister: “He wants to table a motion for a general election, fine.“Get the Bill through first in order to take no deal off the table.”Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said it was vital that the Commons does not “tip our country into an election at a point where there is any risk that we will crash out of the European Union during that election campaign or immediately after”.“We must act responsibly,” she told MPs.Wednesday is set to be a dramatic day in the Commons, with Mr Johnson due to take his first Prime Minister’s Questions at noon before the Chancellor Sajid Javid sets out public spending plans.MPs will then debate the draft legislation put forward by a cross-party group which would require a delay to Brexit unless there was a deal or Parliament explicitly backed leaving the EU without one by October .A vote on a general election could be held later in the day.Meanwhile, a decision is expected at the Court of Session in Edinburgh

Picture by Jonathan Porter Press EyeHosts Morgan and Reid clashed with former DUP health minister Mr Wells, who said that Strictly is “family viewing”, adding: “You’ve had a busy week, you sit down with the family and you watch pure entertainment.“The last thing you want is to be challenged or to be asked deep intellectual questions.”.ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog

.desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Mr Wells, who makes his opposition to same-sex marriage widely known, said that he believes same-sex couples should only be shown on Strictlyit were after the watershed of pm.He cited Blind Date, saying that the programme “went down the plughole” and that viewers switched off after the “radical” move to include homosexual and lesbian couples.Morgan and Reid asked what time he thinks gay couples should be allowed on TV, to which he replied: “Exactly the same time as the BBC thought two years ago, pm.”Morgan asked him: “What are you like at parties  Do you ever dance ”Mr Wells said he rarely dances in public, to which Morgan said: “When you danced and men came on the dancefloor, how did you feel  At what point did you feel like a man entering your orbit became a problem for you ”Reid also challenged Mr Wells’ views, asking: “Have you ever seen children dancing  They dance together, girls dance together, boys dance together, there’s nothing challenging about it.“Your concern is only about seeing gay couples - it’s not about children.”Morgan told him: “I think you’re just an old bigoted dinosaur, and you feel challenged because you don’t like the idea of scary gay people around you.”Referring to former Strictly professional Robin Windsor, who appeared on the programme and was sat next to him, the presenter added: “There’s one right next to you Jim, the whole time you’ve been talking you’ve been in close proximity to a gay man.”Only surviving signatory of

Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Windsor said that he thought Mr Wells’ belief that same-sex couples should only be seen dancing after the watershed was “an absolute disgrace”.During the debate, Mr Wells also said his views are not a “repressed” thing after Morgan told him: “Most people who have this weirdly anti-gay sentiment at some stage in their le have had a ‘feeling’.”After the politician claimed he was being insulted by Morgan, the broadcaster replied: “I’m not insulting you, I’m insulting your bigotry, which is irrational, inconsistent, makes no sense whatsoever, your favourite shows have loads of gay presenters on, there’s a gay judge on Strictly, you think that’s fine but you won’t have two people - who may not even be gay - dancing together.”Mr Wells, who lost the DUP whip after criticising the leadership last year, askedMorgan is meant to be impartial for the interview, to which Reid said: “How can you be impartial about homosexuality ”The politician claimed he has received a lot of support for speaking out about his views, but that people are “scared to stand by traditional values” in fear of the backlash.The BBC last week said that Strictly is an “inclusive show” and that they are “proud to have featured same-sex dancing amongst the professional dancers in group numbers in previous series”.A spokesman said: “We are completely open to the prospect of including same-sex pairings between our celebrities and professional dancers in the future, should the opportunity arise.”try catch  TrendingTransfer

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome.

They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

powerlifting competition for toby  ","story":"A -year-old Tandragee man has received a surprise invitation to represent Northern Ireland in powerlting, only  months after taking up the sport as a result of a joke.Personal trainer Toby Clarke is heading to the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships in St Johns, New Foundland, Canada for September  - having reacted with scepticism to his initial invitation.Toby can now lt almost . times his body weight.“I received the news by email in July while I was finishing up my morning sht in work,” he said. “I initially thought that there had been a mistake and it was sent to me by accident but after a phone call and a couple of back and forward emails I found out that it was genuine and that there was no mistake.“I had only started training for and competing in powerlting back in January  and had competed in my third ever competition back at Christmas in .”He is now able to deadlt almost . times his own body weight, a very respectable achievement in the sport.He did have some experience previously in weightlting while a student at Loughborough University, a dferent sport which requires more speed and complex skills to lt usually lighter weights above the head.“While at Loughborough the weightlters and powerlters trained together and one of my friends, a powerlter, jokingly suggested that I switch to powerlting. So a few months later I did.”In powerlting the aim is to lt as much weight as possible in the deadlt, squat and bench press. The best of three efforts in each lt then gives a total, with the highest total in each weight class winning.His powerlting personal bests at around kg body weight are a kg squat, a kg bench press and kg deadlt, while his weight lting bests are kg in the snatch and a kg clean and jerk. Now head coach at Kaizen Strength gym, near Lurgan, the former Portadown College student earned a degree in Sports Science from the Belfast Met and Loughborough University and is studying for a masters degree in Strength and Conditioning at St Mary’s University in Twickenham. His own trainer is former Loughborough powerlting coach Alec Hewstone of Focus Strength and Conditioning gym in Portadown. He added: “Qualying for the Commonwealth Powerlting Championships was never on my mind and I believed that it would have been another couple of years before I felt that I would have been at the right level before I would have thought about trying to qualy for a competition of that calibre.” He adds: “Training for Canada has been hard going physically but more mentally challenging. I would love to improve all of my lts and my total. However, I’ve picked up a few niggles over the past few weeks, so I just want to go out, enjoy myself, do what I can and stay injury free.”The cost of competing in Canada is stretching, he says, and having already committed all his £ savings to cover his flights, insurance and hotel stay, he has set up a GoFundMe page for supporters to assist with food, transport and additional costs which has so far raised £ of his £, target- www.gofundme f road-to-the-powerlting-commonwealth-games-"},{"url":null,"title":"politics","story":"No records of consultation with the GAA on pitch strategy have been held by Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council, it has been revealed.

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
