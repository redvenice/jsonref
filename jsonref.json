When wondering who might make Princess Eugenie\u0026#39s bridal gown there were plenty of names in the mix. Erdem, Ralph \u0026amp Russo, Stella McCartney... But as she stepped out of the car and headed into St. George\u0026#39s Chapel it was announced that her beautiful dress was the work of Peter Pilotto. It\u0026#39s a million miles away from the designer\u0026#39s signature bold prints, but she is a big fan of the label. We love the elgant long sleeves, jacquard fabric and slightly off shoulder shape with fold over detailing.

Kate Moss and boyfriend Count Nikolai von Bismarck head to the evening reception of Princess Eugenie\u0027s weddingThere was wild dancing, humorous and emotion-filled speeches, a singalong, gourmet pizza and liveried waiters serving bespoke cocktails, including one called a Genie In The Bottle – named after the bride – comprising rose water, vodka and cassis.To rapturous applause and the delight of the happy couple, former Take That star Williams jumped on stage late into the celebrations and sang hits like Let Me Entertain You and Angels.Everyone said it was the ‘party to end all parties’.     Robbie Williams and wife Ayda Field have dressed up for the second night of Eugenie\u0027s festivitiesWhich is exactly what they said about Meghan and Harry’s bash.

The only celebrity with a foot in both events was, appropriately, middle-of-the-road singer James BluntFestivities kicked off around 7.30pm in a £100,000 purpose-built marquee. Carried along by a blast of goodwill, the bride and groom arrived to a standing ovation. The Duke of York, Sarah Ferguson, Eugenie – in full-length pale pink evening gown by American fashion designer Zac Posen – and sister Beatrice hosted tables named after the bride and groom’s favourite movies and places.One table was called Mahiki after the nightclub Jack once helped to run. Prince Andrew’s table included Demi Moore and Naomi Campbell.    Eugenie and husband Jack made the same journey in an Aston Martin originally made for the James Bond movie SpectreThroughout dinner, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra played a musical medley. Bottles of Casamigos tequila sat on every table (the groom flogs the stuff for a living) along with bottles of vintage wine.The bride’s sister and maid of honour Princess Beatrice was MC for the night. ‘She was super,’ said one guest. ‘She took the mic and was very off-the-cuff and really natural. She said how happy she was for her sister.‘Jack gave a lovely speech telling everyone how it was love at first sight when he met Eugenie. He said it was the best day of his life.‘Eugenie also said a few words and I think her speech was the funniest. She told us they’d both kept diaries and she read an excerpt she wrote on the night in 2010 when they met. It was along the lines of “Dear Diary, I met this really cute guy called Jack”.‘She paid tribute to her mum, dad and sister and told everyone how much she loves them. I don’t think there was a dry eye in the house. All of the speeches were really moving. They were very much the highlight of the night.’Dr Anthony Wallersteiner, headmaster of Stowe School, where Jack was a pupil, said: ‘The speeches were amazingly warm, witty and positive.’He said that Jack told guests of his new bride: ‘She lights up my life and makes me feel complete.’          Irene Forte shared a picture of a fairground ride on Instagram with fellow guests Marissa Montgomery and Saloni Lodha          Olympia Greece posted a picture showing the fairground-themed festivities to celebrate Eugenie and Jack\u0027s weddingThe Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales did not attend the evening event but the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge ‘joined in the fun and had a great time’.The marquee was festooned with a cascading floral display in autumnal colours created by wedding florist Ron Van Helden. Outside, trees were bedecked with colourful garlands of light ropes. It was Fergie who persuaded Robbie Williams to take to the stage as a surprise for the newlyweds and the star told guests he was ‘chuffed’ to be asked to sing.‘He was very happy with how it all went and had a great night,’ a friend said.The last guests to leave – Cara Delevingne and sister Poppy – departed at 5.30am.Yesterday, as many as 500 guests kept the celebrations going strong with a ‘festival and funfair’ in the grounds of Royal Lodge featuring bands, a ferris wheel, dodgems, ice cream vans, popcorn stalls, burger vans and a coconut shy. ‘There were lots of Bloody Marys for the hangovers,’ said a source."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/13/12/32F84C7300000578-0-image-a-4_1536836407269.jpg","title":"Model Sophie Dahl follows famous grandfather Roalds footsteps","story":"    Sophie Dahl is writing her first children\u0027s book called Madame BadobedahSophie Dahl is writing her first children\u0027s book - following in the footsteps of her famous grandfather.The former model and TV presenter, 41, has penned a story about a young girl called Mabel and her unlikely friendship with a mysterious elderly lady called Madame Badobedah, the book\u0027s title.Madame Badobedah arrives at Mabel\u0027s hotel by the sea with her array of exotic pets and bundles of possessions, sparking a series of adventures together.Sophie\u0027s grandfather Roald Dahl is one of the world\u0027s most cherished storytellers.He brought to life characters such as the excitable Willy Wonka in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and the despicable Miss Trunchbull in Matilda.And his first grandchild was never far from his mind as he crafted his beloved books, naming The BFG\u0027s protagonist Sophie after her.She now lives in his former home of Great Missenden, Buckinghamshire, with her jazz musician husband Jamie Cullum.Share this articleDahl\u0027s first book for young readers, illustrated by Lauren O\u0027Hara, will be published in October next year.The rights for the story were bought by Walker Books which has published the work of acclaimed children\u0027s writers such as Anthony Horowitz.

And those are exactly the skills and strengths that dyslexics have in abundance.\u0027He will say that for many years dyslexia was seen as a problem and that he struggled to come to terms with his own diagnosis. Donald Tusk says a no deal Brexit is \u0027more likely than ever\u0027...\u0027Get back to the playground\u0027: Ministers lash out at Boris...Share this articleBut he will say that the condition can bring huge benefits for those who have it.He will say: \u0027For years, dyslexia was seen as a problem... But for me, for us, and for the world let us say it loud and clear: dyslexia brings challenges, your brain works in different ways, but with the right support dyslexia brings big benefits too.\u0027Dyslexia isn\u0027t a disability but a difference. It\u0027s a distinction not a drawback.\u0027The Cabinet minister will speak of how he has been \u0027overwhelmed\u0027 at the sheer scale of outpouring of support he has received since revealing earlier this month that he has the condition.Research commissioned to coincide with the summit by the Made by Dyslexia charity showing that nine out of ten dyslexics said they had been made to feel angry, stupid or embarrassed because they had the condition,          Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street today) has said that she will lead the UK into  harnessing the opportunities of the rise of the robots and the fourth industrial revolution In stark contrast, just three per cent think dyslexia is a positive trait, the study found.But Mr Hancock will call for a radical rethink of how people view and approach the condition, which affects how people can read and write.He will say: \u0027Now, those stereotypes have been proven to be lazy and stupid in themselves. Because there\u0027s nothing a dyslexic can\u0027t do. In fact, there\u0027s many things that we can do better.\u0027A dyslexic painted the Mona Lisa, the most famous painting in Western art.\u0027A dyslexic invented the electric lightbulb, ushering in a new age for mankind.\u0027And a dyslexic discovered the theory of relativity, setting a new definition for the word genius.\u0027He will say that dyslexia  equips people with the skills to think creatively and make the most out of the challenges posed by robots. He will say: \u0027So rather than trying to get dyslexics to think like everybody else, we should value the ersity of thought dyslexics bring...\u0027Imagination, creativity, neuro-erse dyslexicabilities are the skills of the future.\u0027Our strengths can help build better businesses, spark innovation, and create new solutions.\u0027So we shouldn\u0027t fear dyslexia, or see it as a weakness.

The Royal baby won’t be a prince or princess, despite being seventh in line to the throneWhy won’t the Royal baby be a prince or princess?Meghan and Harry’s baby is expected to take their father’s title, Sussex, as the surname—just as Princes George and Louis, and Princess Charlotte took the surname Cambridge.But as the second son of the Prince of Wales, Harry’s children are not entitled to receive a HRH title.That is because of Harry’s great-great-grandfather King George V. The monarch limited the titles given within the Royal family in 1917.He declared: \u0027The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.’This means that if the new Royal baby is a boy, he will become the Earl of Dumbarton, a subsidiary title given to Prince Harry on the day of his wedding.If the Royal baby is a girl, she would be  Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, with her sons being Lord Mountbatten-Windsor.However, this is only the case as it stands the Queen can make changes that would see Meghan and Harry’s children become princes and princesses. She did just that ahead of the birth of Prince George, issuing a Letters Patent that ensured all of William and Kate Middleton’s children had HRH titles.Without the Queen’s intervention, Charlotte and Louis would have automatically been Lady and Lord. Prince George would still have been a prince because he was the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The Queen may decide to do the same for Harry’s children.The Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits musicWhen is Spring 2019: When is the first day of spring and how is it decided?Why did Ariana Grade and Pete Davidson split up?Meghan Markle pregnant: This is why Prince Harry\u0027s baby won\u0026#8217t get a prince or princess title like George and Charlotte doMeghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Tour: What will the couple do in Australia?Man Booker Prize 2018 long list: All you need to know Meghan Markle pregnant: All you need to know about Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s babyMeghan Markle pregnant: When is the Royal baby due? X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Friday, October 12Spain vs England: All you need to know about UEFA Nations League gameBTS\u0027s Jimin\u0027s birthday project: Fans celebrate with billboards in New York and AmsterdamBTS\u0027s Jimin pulls out of Graham Norton performance due to injury"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman claims neighbours 60ft evergreen trees BLOCK sunlight RUIN TV signal","story":"    A woman has failed to get her neighbours to chop down their massive trees (pictured) after a 14-year heated disputeA woman who wanted her neighbours to chop down their towering 60ft trees, after claiming they ruined her TV signal and  lawn, has lost after a 14-year heated dispute.Patricia Robb was in a war of words with neighbours Brendan and Mitch Murphy over 60ft evergreen trees that separate their two homes.Mrs Robb, from Renfrewshire in Scotland, claimed the trees cut her TV signal during rough weather conditions.She also alleged the massive evergreens blocked necessary sunlight which stunted the growth of her plum trees and lawn.Tall order!

Equinoxes are when the day and night are equal in length, meaning that the whole planet will get 12 hours of lightness and darkness on an equinox.The term equinox comes from the Latin ‘equi’, which means equal, and ‘nox’, which means night.Spring is set according to the date of the spring equinox, which falls on March 20, 2019, with the season ending on the day of the summer solstice, June 21.The summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, where the Northern Hemisphere gets the most amount of sunlight in the year.Because equinoxes and solstices are related to the Earth’s tilted axis and orbit around the sun, they are not fixed.Therefore, the spring equinox can fall at any point around March 20 and March 21, thus explaining why the first day of spring 2019 will not be the same as the first day of Spring in 2007 (March 21).The Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits musicWhen is Spring 2019: When is the first day of spring and how is it decided?Why did Ariana Grade and Pete Davidson split up?Meghan Markle pregnant: This is why Prince Harry\u0027s baby won\u0026#8217t get a prince or princess title like George and Charlotte doMeghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Tour: What will the couple do in Australia?Man Booker Prize 2018 long list: All you need to know Meghan Markle pregnant: All you need to know about Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s babyMeghan Markle pregnant: When is the Royal baby due? X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Friday, October 12Spain vs England: All you need to know about UEFA Nations League gameBTS\u0027s Jimin\u0027s birthday project: Fans celebrate with billboards in New York and AmsterdamBTS\u0027s Jimin pulls out of Graham Norton performance due to injury"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/16/4AD94EBA00000578-0-image-a-6_1539619187330.jpg","title":"Man Booker Prize 2018 long list need know","story":"Robin Robertson (UK) - The Long Take (Picador)Scottish poet Robin Robertson’s \u0027The Long Take\u0027 is a novel in verse that follows a Canadian who has been recently demobilised after the war.‘A book about a man and a city in shock, it’s an extraordinary evocation of the debris and the ongoing destruction of war even in times of peace.

How Meghan rolled her eyes and appeared to give the fidgeting Prince a subtle telling off at Eugenie\u0027s wedding in a rare moment of conflict between the loved-up pair They\u0027ve been basking in that newlywed glow for months, but it seems that Harry and Meghan may have experienced a rare moment of discord on Eugenie\u0027s big day at St George\u0027s chapel. As the pair waited for the ceremony to begin in St George\u0027s Chapel, the Duchess of Sussex seemed to be telling off her husband as a fidgeting Harry interrupted his wife as she chatted to Zara Tindall. She fired a few words back at him and briefly gesticulates before turning away from him to continue speaking with Zara.Lip readers\u0027 accounts of the conversation were inconclusive due to Harry turning his head to the side as he spoke to Meghan.At one point the couple appeared to be discussing the chapel, the same one they were wed in, as Harry said: \u0027Everything\u0027s different\u0027.To which Meghan snapped back: \u0027Yes, of course, that\u0027s the way.\u0027She then appeared to gesture with her hands at how full the venue was as she said: \u0027Fill up as much.\u0027But Body language expert Judi James noted their strained poses and facial expressions.She told Femail: \u0027Harry appears to be anxious and fidgety when they sit in their pew seats, rocking about and fiddling with the tails of his jacket.     Meghan gesticulates at her husband before turning away to speak with Zara Tindall\u0027Meghan looks calmer and politely sociable, chatting in a much more demure way to Zara in the seat in front.Harry starts to talk to her and she performs a subtle eye-dart to her left, a bit like a mother whose kid is trying to interrupt her grown up conversation. \u0027She turns to Harry and seems to have a slightly firmer conversation, raising her hands and then bringing them together and using a small head-baton gesture for emphasis.\u0027Meghan leans back towards Zara, resuming her polite social smile along with their conversation. \u0027Harry rubs his face, chews his lips and leans into the side of his seat like a child that has just been told to sit still.\u0027    Price reaches £1,000 for Eugenie wedding goodie bags containing £15 worth of treats including shortbread, magnet and biodegradable poncho being sold on eBayPrincess Eugenie\u0027s wedding goody bags - containing spoils such as shortbread, chocolate gold coins and ponchos - are being sold for as much as £1,000 online.As well as special memories, the 1,200 members of the public invited to celebrate in the grounds of Windsor Castle walked away with the bags containing £15 of treats.But while many of the guests at the royal nuptials were delighted with their luxurious maroon cotton souvenirs, others decided to cash in on the exclusive gift.             Prince Andrew looked a little tired this morning as he went for a ride at Windsor Castle after his daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s star studded wedding bash, which went on until the early hours of the morning in the grounds of his home, The Royal Lodge             The Duke seemed fresh-faced while on his ride in the grounds in cool autumn air after the wedding of his daughter yesterday   The royal wedding\u0027s most glamorous guests?

They now live together in England.The pair, who tied the knot at Chelsea Town Hall, have been hailed as ‘polo’s dream couple’.The name Oettingen-Wallerstein dates back 900 years and the House of Wallerstein is one of the oldest remaining high nobilities in Europe. The family’s business interests include the brewery and real estate.              Bavarian princess Yoanna Otto, 30,  wore a glittering gold evening gown by Reema Acra for the lavish party at The Royal Lodge, Windsor that showcased her incredibly neat baby bump, which she attended with her polo player husband Charlie Hanbury   Still a style icon! How Princess Diana inspired royal wedding outfits worn by Kate Moss, the Duchess of Cambridge and Fergie\u0027s half-sister Princess Diana was a  style icon whose fashion choices are still admired 21 years after her death, so it\u0027s no wonder guests at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding yesterday decided to take inspiration from her royal style book. Some of the looks were more of a subtle nod to Diana, whilst others near enough wore replicas of some of Diana’s most famous looks.Sarah Ferguson’s half-sister Eliza Ferguson near enough copied one of Diana’s classic Royal Ascot outfits, from the 1986 event in a green polka dot wrap dress with a matching hat, as Diana had in 1986.Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cambridge, Ellie Goulding and Holly Candy also seemed to give a nod to the late princess\u0027 iconic style with their outfits.      Fergie\u0027s half sister Eliza Ferguson (right) mirrored one of Diana\u0027s most famous looks from 1986, when she had worn a green dress to Royal Ascot (left)    Diana favoured the polka dot look and wore this black and white dress to a polo match in 1987 (left).

The loose fitting dress was belted, and the star paired the look with some dance floor-ready white heels.Princess Diana wore a similar dress in 1983, but had of course accessorised with a tiara.

The dress had been made by designer Catherine Walker.Aside from pop royalty, fashion royalty Kate Moss also jumped on the band wagon when she arrived wearing a demure polka dot two piece. Kate ditched her usual smoky eyed look and went for a more neutral palette to attend the ceremony at St George’s chapel.

I’d expected to be among, let’s face it, be-Union-Jacked fruitcakes and a few passing Japanese tourists for this, the wedding of a radiant but minor Royal.I can’t help but laugh when the woman next to me, Sheryl Arredondo, who arrived last night from Michigan and is sporting Union Jack nail polish, tells me the presenters on ITV have been debating how to pronounce the bride’s name: ‘Is it EUgenee or EuJANEee?’No one’s ever said it much, I tell her. I’m someone who has found it hard to distinguish Eugenie from her older sister, Beatrice.‘When I told my co-workers I was coming over for the wedding, they had no idea who she was,’ Sheryl says. ‘Until I said that Fergie’s her mum.’ So why on earth has she travelled all this way? ‘I’m 66. This might be the last Royal Wedding I get the chance to see.’As more people arrive, and ooh and aah at the castle, it becomes clear the reason we’re here is to be able to say we were part of history we were there.It’s not just another society knees-up, so many people – young and old – tell me: ‘The bride is the Queen’s granddaughter.’Even if we don’t know everything about her, there’s huge affection washing around, keeping us warm: ‘Eugenie is one of the quieter ones,’ admit Julie and Malcolm, now expats in Sydney. ‘We miss all this,’ they add, taking in the pomp and the pageantry.

If you’re photographed next to him, what does that say about you?’ I tell him Posh and Becks are a no-show, but that Jimmy Carr is here. ‘You see?’ he says. ‘Tax avoiders. They need to be careful. It looks like the Firm are fawning over famous people. They should stick to inviting European dignitaries, not models.’I counter that the British Royal Family has always courted the famous. Diana was friends with Elton John and Gianni Versace. Several women give me an ‘off with her head’ stare. No one is allowed to utter a bad word about Di. ‘She was always much more famous than anyone else,’ I’m told. ‘Eugenie is in danger of being eclipsed.’In fact, throughout the whole day, the only people I meet who are keen to glimpse James Blunt, say, or Robbie Williams – who turns up chewing gum! – is a group of horsey ladies, here rather noisily from the Cotswolds. ‘We went out to the farm shop where they were supposed to be uploading stars on to coaches, but we didn’t even see Ellie Goulding!’ Are they upset? ‘Nah! As long as we see Zara Phillips. We love her!’We watch the ceremony on someone else’s phone, as mine has died. As Eugenie says her vows, ‘I’m shedding a few tears,’ says a 50-year-old former PR who has dealt with her share of selfish, unruly pop stars. ‘It was so romantic and traditional. So English, with those rosy cheeks.’          MISCHIEF: Prince George and his cousin Savannah enjoying themselves at Eugenie\u0027s wedding          Prince George  reacts as he arrives with bridesmaids at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor CastleAs the ceremony draws to a close, everyone straightens and cranes for the moment the carriage containing the couple will flash past. Don’t we think Eugenie is making a bit too much fuss, I whisper to a woman from Wales.‘Every girl dreams of a fuss. She’s spent her life being carer to her parents, she deserves today. I hope they will be happy.’ My goodness, this crowd is generous. What about the £2 million spent on the police? ‘It’s less than was spent on Trump!’When at last the carriage passes the crowd, now four-deep but as bald as William’s head in places, I’m puzzled no great cheer goes up, just a weak titter.‘That’s because we were all taking photos on our phones,’ says a misty-eyed lady.Of course, the stars had been invited, and seemed thrilled, but they will have spent considerable time over the years grooming the young princes and princesses, slicking their own events with magisterial magic. They seem to think they are ‘better’ than the Royals, and by that I don’t just mean better looking.In church, most stars’ eyes swivelled towards Demi Moore, not the Queen. Celebrities always do as they please, too (which I doubt is a luxury Meghan can now enjoy), thinking rules don’t apply to them, which is why some sneakily posted on Instagram from inside the church. Whatever happened to respect?The other wedding that took place on Friday morning was one between celebrity and Royalty. It was a marriage of convenience, one guaranteed to reap the most coverage and viewers, but where will it lead?It implies, with the positioning of the gum-smacking Robbie Williams and his wife so near the Queen, that the famous and the Royals are equal. That they belong to the same club. The one that digs up basements and annoys neighbours, lives in faux Georgian mansions, has affairs and runs out of money. This young batch of Royals (‘they are so good for PR,’ one 55-year-old woman proudly wearing a £5 Eugenie and Jack scarf tells me) have only just got the Firm back on track. Let’s not derail it now.          Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fictionThe Royal Family are different, and if they’re not, then why are we paying for them? If Euge! and Jack are no better than Posh and Becks, why should we revere them and wave to them in glass carriages? We will turn into America, where money, not history or duty, rules.I’m sure the Queen has famous friends, but I doubt they snort coke. I wonder, too, at Beatrice’s choice of reading, from The Great Gatsby. It’s a book about spoilt, rich, empty idiots who destroy everything and trample over everyone around them. That’s not the Royal Family. That’s Hollywood.Even the choice of car to carry the couple from the reception – an Aston Martin made for the James Bond film Spectre – pays homage to fiction. There’s a danger the bona fide glamour of the Royals will be tarnished by this constant clamouring for the faux. They will become a chimera, as easy to erase as a Pixar cartoon.Oh, and by the way, Williams was no longer chewing when he emerged after the ceremony.

Campaigners say dogs rarely die in one shot and are left twitching in agony in their final moments.Officially, the bodies are then transported out of the cities for safe burial - but photos of bodies in lakes and on roadsides have raised fears that this is not always the case.

The Royal couple arrived on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, for their first major international tour since their world-stopping nuptials.They shunned a private jet to travel on flight Qantas flight QF2 from London via Singapore.The couple were in the first class cabin but non-royal passengers were also with them with one saying they were heard saying how \u0027excited\u0027 they were to be travelling to Australia. With them was their entourage of 10 staff members, including press secretaries and a hairdresser, and several more security staff. Royal fans already suspected the Duchess was pregnant after she wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding on Friday.Many TV viewers were sure they could see a baby-bump beneath her long, navy blue coat as the Duchess was whisked into St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor by her doting husband. The couple held hands when they arrived in Sydney early on Monday morning on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore.Meghan was wearing her favourite Sarah Flint heels, which she teamed with the two tone coat she wore in a photo of her and Harry posing with the official 2018 Invictus Games flag last week.Earlier she sparked a storm of pregnancy speculation after she touched down in Sydney clutching two purple folders in front of her stomach.Meghan Markle was seen holding the items in her right arm as she stepped off the plane on Monday morning with Prince Harry, leaving fans of the Royal couple guessing what information they could contain. For many, the folders added to speculation Meghan Markle is expecting a baby, fuelling the fire already stoked by the large blue coat she wore at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week. The couple returned to their own wedding venue at Windsor Castle on Friday but missed a lavish second day of celebrations on Saturday because of their flight to Australia.            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are pictured arriving at Admiralty House in Sydney\u0027s Kirribilli as keen Royal watchers look on          The motorcade carrying Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, makes its way through peak hour traffic on Sydney\u0027s Eastern Distributor on Monday morningMeghan Markle beams as she arrives in Sydney with Prince HarryDoorwoman stops black man from entering his own apartment\u0027Difficult moment\u0027: Jeremy Hunt unsure when Brexit deal timingMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyHarry and Meghan at Admiralty House after landing in AustraliaPiers Morgan accuses campaigner of wanting to remember ISIS fightersHarry and Meghan: World reacts to royal baby newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at dawn in SydneyHarry and pregnant Meghan holding hands hours before announcementTourists react with joy to Harry and Meghan\u0027s royal baby newsMoment when two men spike a drink with MDMA in an off-license shopKanye runs around Uganda carrying North on his shoulders    Prince Harry appeared to take some time out on Monday during his trip to Admiralty House, spotted perched on a step alongside a man believed to be a security guard (pictured)          Flying from London to Sydney is a tiring journey, but The Duchess of Sussex was in the best possible cabin for the 23-hour trip – first class in a Qantas A380 (file picture).It\u0027s a state-of-the-art aircraft with in-built anti-jet-lag technology.It produces 50 per cent less cabin noise than a 747 and has cabin air pressure that\u0027s equivalent to an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000ft). The 747\u0027s is 2,500 metres (8,000ft).Plus, cabin air is recycled every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh.Then there\u0027s the Qantas touch.Meghan would have been in an \u0027expansive armchair\u0027 that converts to a fully flat bed.Cabin crew would have given her a pillow menu, a 100 per cent cotton woven throw, a duvet and a memory foam mattress. And cotton pyjamas with matching slippers.She would also have been able to enjoy an in-seat massage at the touch of a button and pressed another one to lower and raise the window blinds.It\u0027s definitely an aircraft fit for pregnant royalty.                                                      They will spend a week in the country and then on Tuesday, October 23 they will head to Fiji for two days and then on to Tonga before returning to Australia.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31. \u0027The programme across these four Commonwealth countries will focus on youth leadership, environmental and conservation efforts, including the dedication of several new Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy projects, and the recovery and rehabilitation of servicemen and women through the Invictus Games Sydney 2018,\u0027 the palace said in a short statement when announcing the tour itinerary.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend 76 engagements across the four countries, including the Invictus Games in Sydney, which runs from October 20 and October 28.Prince Harry founded the sporting event, which gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball, in 2014.The couple will mark the games\u0027 launch and closing ceremony. And to officially welcome the Invictus Games to the city, Prince Harry, prime minister Scott Morrison and athletes will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge to plant the Invictus flag. Among the other highlights of their tour will be a visit to the world-renowned Taronga Zoo, in Sydney, where they will meet two koalas and their joeys. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the zoo with Prince George during their royal tour in 2014.Elsewhere the couple will visit Australian farmers struck by drought. The couple\u0027s arrival in Australia comes just days after they attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank where they told close family their happy news.   Revealed: How Meghan and Harry\u0027s baby will be SEVENTH in line to the throne - but WON\u0027T be a prince or princessThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.  However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules.

The baby will bump Harry\u0027s uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen\u0027s youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.How will the baby be related to the Queen?The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales\u0027s grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s niece or nephew.Will he or she ever be monarch?Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.What will the baby be called?William and Kate chose royal favourites for their children.But will Harry and American-born Meghan go classic or break the royal mould when naming their baby?If they stay traditional, something like Alice, Mary, Elizabeth or Victoria for a girl, and James, Philip, Frederick or Arthur for a boy are possibilities.In the US, the most popular name for a baby girl is Emma and Liam for a baby boy.Will the baby be a prince or princess?No they will not be a prince nor a princess, nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in 1917.So what will their title be?A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his father\u0027s other lesser titles as a courtesy title.Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom.A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could change this?Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of George\u0027s birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridges\u0027 children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny?Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. But Meghan\u0027s mother Doria has been seen attending baby care classes, suggesting that she may move to the UK to help out. When and where will the baby be born?Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-law\u0027s lead. Harry was also born there in 1984. It is close to Kensington Palace and well practised at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But Meghan could do down a different path and have a home birth. Will the baby have dual citizenship?Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year. The happy news was announced hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May.A Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.  Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild. The duchess has also been seen in a number of looser-fitting outfits over recent weeks.  The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William\u0027s children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. The baby will supersede Prince Andrew in the line of succession, regardless of whether they are a boy or a girl, following a 2011 change in law that granted the same status to sons and daughters.However as the second son of the current Prince of Wales, Harry\u0027s children are not automatically given the title of prince or princess.King George V - Harry\u0027s great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917.This means Harry and Meghan\u0027s first born, as a great-grandchild of the sovereign, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH.George V declared that: \u0027the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.\u0027The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his father\u0027s lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debrett\u0027s.So a first son of Harry\u0027s would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons Lord (first name) Mounbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghan\u0027s children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.Ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles.Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince.The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghan\u0027s baby.  The Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.But the couple decided, with the Queen\u0027s agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement in November 2017, shortly after confirming their relationship. The couple married at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May this year.   Is Fergie\u0027s tweetstorm a swipe at Meghan for upstaging Eugenie with baby news at her wedding?

Just hours before Harry and Meghan\u0027s happy news was announced this morning, fans couldn\u0027t help but notice the strategically-placed plastic folders the Duchess was clutching to her chest after touching down in Sydney in an oversized coat and polo neck            Meghan\u0027s choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame (pictured with the Queen and Prince Harry outside St. George\u0027s Chapel)But it was her choice of clothing that was the most telling, with the Duchess - once a fan of figure-hugging silhouettes - wrapping up in a turtleneck jumper and oversized navy coat.Likewise, her choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame.Coincidentally, it was also the day that Meghan and Harry chose to share their happy news with the rest of the family. Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail: \u0027We are so used to seeing Meghan in form-fitting apparel, it was hard not to speculate that a new arrival was imminent when she recently started to sport baggier items. \u0027The use of knee-length coats has cleverly helped Meghan avoid speculation and, as it\u0027s now very much the autumnal season, the use of long oversized coats didn\u0027t arouse suspicion. Meghan Markle beams as she arrives in Sydney with Prince HarryDoorwoman stops black man from entering his own apartment\u0027Difficult moment\u0027: Jeremy Hunt unsure when Brexit deal timingMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyHarry and Meghan at Admiralty House after landing in AustraliaPiers Morgan accuses campaigner of wanting to remember ISIS fightersHarry and Meghan: World reacts to royal baby newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at dawn in SydneyHarry and pregnant Meghan holding hands hours before announcementTourists react with joy to Harry and Meghan\u0027s royal baby newsMoment when two men spike a drink with MDMA in an off-license shopKanye runs around Uganda carrying North on his shoulders      Earlier this month, Meghan visited Sussex in a businesslike bottle-green ensemble but was careful to drape a structured coat over the top to carefully conceal her silhouette (pictured with Prince harry at Edes House in Chichester on 3 October)    Careful planning: Meghan wore a draped Givenchy dress at the Royal Academy of Arts in September (left) and an Oscar de la Renta peplum top in Loughborough in September (right)Meghan Markle beams as she arrives in Sydney with Prince HarryDoorwoman stops black man from entering his own apartment\u0027Difficult moment\u0027: Jeremy Hunt unsure when Brexit deal timingMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyHarry and Meghan at Admiralty House after landing in AustraliaPiers Morgan accuses campaigner of wanting to remember ISIS fightersHarry and Meghan: World reacts to royal baby newsPrince Harry and Meghan Markle arrive at dawn in SydneyHarry and pregnant Meghan holding hands hours before announcementTourists react with joy to Harry and Meghan\u0027s royal baby newsMoment when two men spike a drink with MDMA in an off-license shopKanye runs around Uganda carrying North on his shoulders      Covering up: Meghan wore an oversized blue coat for the launch of a charity cookbook at Kensington Palace last month (pictured with Prince Harry and mother Doria Ragland, who said today she was \u0027very happy\u0027 about the couple\u0027s pregnancy news and may move to the UK)            Baby blue?

They stood down shortly afterwards due to the minimal number of casualties, with all those involved in the tragedy either dead or having suffered minor injuries.The bodies and wreckage had come down in two main flight corridors, one of which included the Kielder forest in Northumbria, the most densely-wooded part of the UK.At the height the plane had been flying, winds were more than 100 knots. Some of the lighter pieces of wreckage were found miles away.On the night of the crash, police made an immediate policy decision to treat the disaster as a criminal investigation.Public confirmation of what had been suspected from the outset came on December 28, when investigators announced that traces of high explosive had been found and the plane had been brought down by a bomb.A later fatal accident inquiry was to determine that the bomb was in a Toshiba radio-cassette player in a Samsonite suitcase which \u0027probably\u0027 joined the flight at Frankfurt in Germany.Of the 259 passengers and crew - 150 men and 109 women - killed, 188 were Americans and 33 were British.

Both properties give you stunning views of the Cornish countrysideSome of the properties, that are clustered around the original well which still provides the water supply, are restricted to holiday use only.Mr Bradby lives in one of the cottages and spends much of the time there and owns the arable farmland.Morveren House was built in 1909 for Sir Edward Hain, a prominent MP for St Ives, who was also town mayor six times and was knighted for his services to the county in 1910.It has a reception hall, kitchendining room, lounge, sitting room, utility room, four bedrooms and three bathrooms.Cara Cottage, which has been a successful holiday let through Air B\u0026ampB, is single storey and has a kitchenreception room, two bedrooms and a bathroom.The house has views over patchwork fields to the granite cliffs and the sea, the same landscape that inspired DH Lawrence, who lived four miles away in Zennor when he wrote Women in Love (1916).Mr Bradby said: \u0027When I looked into the history of Trowan I was fascinated. It\u0027s one of the oldest farmed landscapes in the world.          Some of the dilapidated buildings on the site when Phil Bradby purchased the site. Mr Bradby lives in one of the cottages and spends much of the time there and owns the surrounding arable farmland          The site at Morveren House during the renovation. Mr Bradby lives in one of the cottages he previously purchased and spends much of the time there and owns the arable farmland          Mr Bradby admits he spent \u0027millions\u0027 upgrading the hamlet when he first purchase it (pictured) and it has been the longest project he has ever been involved in\u0027The oldest building in the hamlet dates back to the 1500s. The hamlet used to be much bigger, but a number of them were demolished some to build Morveren House in 1909.\u0027It was split up after the farmer died, so I didn\u0027t get a chance to buy Morveren House when I bought the rest of the properties.\u0027When I bought the hamlet the house was intact and livable, but the man who owned it started to renovate it, took the roof off and stripped it out, then quickly ran out of money and it was just left.\u0027I developed the other buildings but I was left in a situation where the hamlet was complete apart from one piece.\u0027Morveren House was the last piece of the jigsaw and I felt it was a bit of a shame because it was the biggest house in the village.\u0027It eventually got repossessed and put up for auction and it was just by luck that I happened to notice the board go up in the same spot as I\u0027d first seen the for sale sign for Trowan.\u0027It\u0027s now a lovely Cornish community, with 14 different properties, some holiday lets and some permanent homes.\u0027Each property has got its own character, which made the job more complicated, but it looks great because each one is unique.\u0027The views are amazing, you can see as far as Godrevy Lighthouse and right round the bay.\u0027          Renovation work being carried out on one of the derelict homes. In all, it took Mr Bradby 15 years to realise his dream of transforming the entire hamletAlthough Mr Bradby has made a profit, he said the project has been more a labour of love than a money-making scheme.He said: \u0027I\u0027m not sure exactly how much we spent but it has been millions. It\u0027s not easy doing inidual builds.\u0027You don\u0027t make big profits in this sort of thing, what I do is very niche, big developers would not take on a project like this because everything has to be bespoke.\u0027I\u0027m very proud of it, but at 15 years it\u0027s definitely the longest project I\u0027ve ever done.\u0027It\u0027s an amazing place and I\u0027m still involved with it - I own and look after the farmland and we\u0027re currently growing 650,000 cabbages.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/23/06263554000007D0-6275615-image-a-2_1539556470200.jpg","title":"Turkish officials today search Saudi consulate Khashoggi","story":"    Turkish forensic investigators gather on the steps of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as they prepare to enter the building this evening          The crack team of investigators could be seen marching through the door which Jamal Khashoggi walked through two weeks ago          A group of Saudi security officials prepare to let the Turkish police officers into the building at the center of the scandal          The team of officers arrived by van and were met by a horde of reporters from the global media as they entered the buildingSpeaking to reporters in the White House this morning, Trump said King Salman\u0027s denial \u0027could not have been stronger.\u0027 \u0027He said it very strongly,\u0027 Trump said when pressed to say whether he believed the Saudi king.He added: \u0027It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers.

The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but he says he resisted.Singer denied these allegations, claiming they were \u0027outrageous, vicious, and completely false.\u0027Egan ultimately withdrew his lawsuit after turning down a $100,000 settlement from Singer with an option to re-file at any time.Singer launched his career with The Usual Suspects and later earned raves for his work in the first two X-Men films, though he followed that up with a number of underwhelming flops, including Superman Returns and Jack the Giant Slayer. "},{"url":null,"title":"Hilarious moment elephant calf kicks man backside","story":"    A playful elephant calf ticked a tourist on the backside when he tried to take a selfie with himBut the calf wasn\u0027t interested in being in a selfie, and instead jumped down from the wall with its head facing the ground.Psycho cat rips through plastic shower curtain… to take a...Share this articleThe tourist moved with him, bending down with his camera to take the picture from a different angle.But when he moved to touch the side of the elephant\u0027s head, the youngster lashed out, kicking the tourist on the backside with his back foot.

The crowdfunded spectacle allows artists to have their say – and perhaps their influence – ahead of the midterm elections.“One guy wrote us and said: ‘I see this ‘Pardon Me’ billboard every day on my way to work, can you tell me what this means?’” said Wyatt Gallery, the billboard director at For Freedoms, the New York organization behind the project. “He asked: ‘What side are you on? Are you pro-Trump or anti-Trump?’ People can’t figure out what side we’re on, or if there is a side. It makes people think more and to reach out and ask us.”The goal, according to the For Freedoms co-founder Eric Gottesman, is to make “anti-partisan” statements on the billboards, alongside art exhibitions, installations and public programs to deepen what he calls “civic participation”.“It’s not just voting, it’s about using our voices to speak up about the things we feel strongly about,” said Gottesman. “We believe all art is political, so when artists get engaged, the conversation changes. It’s important for artists’ voices not to be marginalized or only to be seen in these elite institutions, but be more at the center of public life.”Each billboard is emblazoned with the For Freedoms logo, which is how people find them online. “People look us up or call the billboard company to inquire what the billboards mean,” said Gallery. “That’s a huge sign of success, that people are willing to take that step.”There are more than 50 billboards designed by artists, which will be up through the end of November. More than 200 institutions and 400 artists across the country will be hosting talks, projects and exhibits related to political art in partnership with the organization.Among the billboards, Fred Tomaselli’s shows a map of America accompanied by the sentence I’ve Fallen and I Can’t Get Up in Helena, Montana. Meanwhile, Paula Crown has created a billboard that says Hurt People Hurt People in Los Angeles.New York photographer Marilyn Minter, known for her misty portraits of women behind glass, shows a piece entitled Sad! in Little Rock, Arkansas, referencing an insult phrase the president has commonly used on Twitter.“I chose ‘Sad!’ because I wanted to use and subvert a common Trump adjective,” said Minter. “It also describes the current state of our country and our administration, by using it, I was able to be as nasty as possible without being outright political.”Others take a different approach, like William Scott and David Byrne, who show a billboard of African Americans with the tagline United States of Peace on view in Newark, New Jersey. Over in Las Cruces, New Mexico, Richard Misrach’s billboard features a foggy shot of the Mexican border wall with the phrase Romans 13:10 (It refers to a Bible verse: “Love does no harm to a neighbor”).Luis Jacob, a Canadian artist, is showing a billboard in Vermont entitled Land Acknowledgement, which reads Abenaki, the name of the tribe based in the region. “This piece engages the politics of indigenous land sovereignty on colonized territory,” said Jacob, who teaches art at the Vermont College of Fine Arts.“It also poses questions about my relationship, as a Canadian artist born in Peru, to this place now called Vermont, where I teach,” he says.As a response to Jacob’s billboard, a member of the Vermont Commission on Native American Affairs contacted the artist. “He said he found the artistic concept behind the image compelling,” said Jacob, “and hoped the project would help build connections between the Abenaki community, artists and institutions, such as VCFA, to improve relations.”Over in Idaho, Emily Hanako Momohara is showing a billboard that reads Never Again Is Now, alongside images of Japanese Americans from the second world war. It ties into the artist’s own past.“My family was incarcerated at Minidoka which is located in southern Idaho,” she said. “When asked to do a billboard, my first inclination was to show the parallel of the unconstitutional incarceration in 1942, family detention and child imprisonment of migrant people on our southern border.”All of the billboard artists were chosen by a curatorial team. “The guidelines were anti-partisan,” said Gottesman. “It’s not about taking sides, it’s to ask questions, even if they don’t end in a question mark.“Often the response to the billboards is a question: ‘What does this mean?’” he adds. “We say: ‘What do you think it means? We don’t know, help us figure out what this means together.’”Some of the billboards are specific to certain cities. “Some artists felt like a certain part of the country would make sense,” said Gallery. “Others wanted to be as close to the Mexican border as possible, or in certain regions. We tried to honor those wishes to create a dynamic conversation.”One example is Jamila El Sahili’s billboard along a highway in Michigan, which spells out the words Human Being in Arabic (with no translation). “We put that in Michigan where there is a woman running for Congress who is Muslim and there is a large Arab population,” said Gallery. “We tried to match cities with the issues and the art.”Crown’s other billboard, Thoughts and Prayers, which has two guns pointing at another, is set in Wyoming, the state with the highest number of guns per capita. “We also put it in Chicago which has a large problem with gun violence,” adds Gallery.Over in Baltimore, Steve Lock’s billboard is a memorial for Freddie Gray, the 25-year-old man who died after suffering a spinal injury in the back of a police van.Another is Emily Jacir’s billboard, which says Translate Allah, on display in Salem, Massachusetts. Locals are responding. “People are calling the billboard company and asking ‘what is this about?’” said Gallery. “People are taking notice as to what these billboards mean in the context of what’s happening today.”When asked if they’ve received any hate mail yet, Gottesman said, “not yet, and ‘yet’ is the key word”.Many of the billboards are along highways of rural areas. In a way, they catch people off guard while driving, often a time of solitude or reflection. But the billboards are intentionally timed to coincide with the midterm elections and ultimately, they could change the way Americans look at art, politics and the role of advertising in public space. “We want to add more nuance in the kind of conversation we have in public about these issues,” said Gottesman. “By inserting artist voices into the landscape, and into the public conversation, we hope to do that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c042ad97a4d8be5a2d6a29914a3f627f8bba2c1f/1194_618_2349_1409/master/2349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dce2aebe637e1295e44bc0bfeba9e7ff","title":"lisa reihana in pursuit of venus infected oceania royal academy london","story":"The leading New Zealand artist explains why she reimagined the explorer as a woman – and relives the time her friend threw a wet T-shirt at the QueenOne day several years ago, Lisa Reihana was walking through a Canberra museum with her partner when something caught his eye. It was a set of French woodblock designs for wallpaper dating from the 19th century, depicting the colonial encounters of Captain Cook. They were called Savages of the Pacific Ocean.The New Zealand artist bought the catalogue but thought little more of it until she was commissioned to make a super-wide video projection and was casting around for ideas. “I came across the catalogue,” she says, “and thought, ‘Eureka! I just need to bring this to life.’”It is now acting as the grand finale of Oceania, the UK’s first major survey of Melanesian, Micronesian and Polynesian art, which has just opened at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, marking the 250th anniversary of Cook’s voyages to the Pacific Islands.The original wallpaper – depicting the three expeditions made between 1768 and 1779 – adorned dining and drawing rooms across Europe and North America. But, says Auckland-born Reihana, the scenes they recreated were “a concoction, a fabulation invented in someone else’s elsewhere”.The greenery, for example, was transplanted not from Polynesia but from South America, which Jean Gabriel Charvet, the Frenchman who designed the wallpaper, had recently visited. Similarly, the idealised, pale-skinned locals are dressed in neoclassical costumes inspired more by what had recently been dug up at Pompeii than by anything from Hawaii or Tahiti.The 20 sheets of wallpaper, comprising more than 1,000 woodblock prints, were a technological triumph in their day. The ability to manufacture long drops was a spinoff from advances made in the creation of hot air balloons. Both offered exciting new ways of seeing the world.Reihana’s own attempt to recast the European fabrication is a hi-tech marvel for this century. The projection is 22.5 metres wide, lasts 64 minutes, and has 1,500 digital layers made up of more than three trillion pixels. Backing up the project, which was completed at Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings post-production facility in Wellington, can consume an entire weekend.Reihana, whose mother was born in Britain and whose father’s Māori roots can be traced back at least seven generations, was keen to insert complexity at every turn. Her “panoramic pantomime” boasts 70 vignettes that slowly scroll across the hand-painted landscape. Historic and imagined scenes featuring indigenous actors are accompanied by an evocative soundscape. The work of James Pinker, Reihana’s partner, it includes dialogue in several Pacific languages.“I thought that if I took people’s language away,” says Reihana, “it was almost like another colonisation – in not allowing the actors to speak their truth.”The artist frequently plays with gender. There is a man pretending to give birth and an indigenous person pulling down Cook’s breeches. “Because they couldn’t see his genitals and he didn’t sleep with the local women,” she explains, “they didn’t know if he was a male or a female.”In half of the video, the captain is played by a friend of Reihana’s called Julia Waite, a gay woman who had been nicknamed Cook as a child because of her height and facial resemblance. “Takatāpui is a Māori word meaning people of the same sex who are great friends,” says Reihana. “Fa’afafine is a word that relates to Samoa, where a man takes the manner of a woman and might look after the family and take on other duties. It’s a kind of culturally known and accepted thing to do. So I wanted to show that.”The giant moving tableau also depicts men wrestling, a kava-drinking ceremony, haka and hula dances, the trading of iron for sexual favours, several floggings and Cook’s violent death. The RA has organised private and public blessing ceremonies for indigenous groups to honour the show’s sacred exhibits. Three-quarters of the objects come from European collections, and since the show opened on September 29 one Solomon Islands museum director has already called for the return of a seven-metre-long, crocodile-shaped feast trough, which was looted by a British captain in 1891. Prior to the opening, he was not aware of its existence.For Reihana, the removal of artworks from their countries of origin is more than a lofty debate. She says she struggled to persuade indigenous communities to act out her scenes because of it. “Some people have been devastated by colonisation and they’re too scared to even give something over because it’s like you’re taking something again and again.”Rather than a one-way return of disputed works, she advocates a “circulation” of artefacts. In return, the indigenous institutions would lend new pieces. “Circulation is really interesting with the Tahitian people, in terms of their tattoo culture. Because cultural practices were banned, they look to the patterns on these objects and start to employ them on to the body. So they become living and part of the general conversation.”However, she believes there can be no compromise when it comes to the repatriation of exhibits containing human remains. “You want your people and your bones back, right?”When I ask Reihana and Pinker if it is unusual in artistic couples for the man to take the back seat while the woman has her name above the shop, I get blank looks from both. They um and ah, before Reihana finally declares: “We’re from New Zealand, right, so we gave the vote to women first. It’s just normal. It’s a generalisation. But I think, because we’ve got a much smaller population, there’s less hierarchy and ideas move quite quickly.”Pinker mentions the fact that the country is now led by Jacinda Ardern – “a young woman prime minister,” he says, “who we adore.”“She’s just had a baby!” exclaims Reihana as Pinker adds: “She’s unmarried, in parliament running the place, and she’s absolutely brilliant.”Both are fearful about New Zealand becoming a luxury bolthole for Silicon Valley billionaires, who have been buying up land as a haven from any future apocalypse. Pinker points out that a lot of it is “Māori land that was confiscated”, while Reihana says: “I think it’s terrible, it worries me.”They view Brexit as “a shambles”, yet also sense an opportunity for renewed trade links with New Zealand, neglected since Britain joined what was then the EEC in 1973. (Incidentally, an RA insider told me the sponsorship of the exhibition by the governments of New Zealand, Tonga and Papua New Guinea was probably done with at least one eye on these new economic horizons.)Reihana has mixed feelings about the Commonwealth. News of the Windrush scandal made it to New Zealand, leaving a bitter taste that contrasts with the news that Harry and Meghan will visit Oceania on their first royal tour. “At its best, the Commonwealth should be this free flow of people between multiple cultures,” says Reihana. But she refers to the “fraught histories” tied up in what Pinker dubs “the decaying empire” and admits: “Oh gosh, some people hate it.”She recalls how her friend greeted the Queen on a visit to Waitangi in 1990 by throwing a wet T-shirt at her. “It was a massive insult,” she says. “She was a lawyer and she defended herself – and invoked the right to speak in Te Reo Māori. All of her arguments were conducted in Māori.”As her work takes pride of place in the RA’s largest gallery, Reihana says she does not expect Brits to feel guilt watching its brutal scenes of colonisation. So what does she want? “To indicate there’s a level of complexity. To elicit some kind of empathy and alert people to some of that history. But I’m not really pointing the finger at anyone.”• Oceania is at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, until 10 December."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a89a9d23d317c22304157057d4fd0aa8d16a8e/0_314_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3904043bd23cbbdc3df5e2c7985de5","title":"david goldblatts photographs documenting the casual horror of apartheid south africa","story":"Goldblatt’s photographs capture the understated unease of living an ordinary life in a society that was anything but normalThe photograph makes me squirm. Four young women, cling-wrapped in awkward swimsuits and perched on high heels, stand on display. One smirks, the other three look unsure. They clutch their competition numbers and present their naked white legs for consideration by the unseen judges.Behind the stage, a crowd of mostly women and children cluster around the elevated stage, their faces resigned or perplexed. Dotted among the crowd, a few white men stare blankly, appraising the women’s bodies, while the only black man frowns. Most people seem bemused by the uncomfortable spectacle taking place in their local supermarket. Outside the frame, shoppers push their trolleys through the aisles, taking toilet paper and bread rolls and washing powder off the shelves.It makes me shudder because David Goldblatt took the photograph “Saturday Morning at the Hypermarket: Miss Lovely Legs Competition” at the supermarket where my mother shopped when I was a child growing up in South Africa. And if my seven-year-old self wasn’t there on that day in 1980, I probably was later that week.In itself, the image is ordinary. Like many of Goldblatt’s photographs, it isn’t dramatic, the subjects unknown. But it shows the casualness of a society separated by apartheid. It captures the uneasiness that pulsed through my childhood growing up in South Africa. It recalls things I saw but did not see. And it drags up the old questions that lurk beneath my memories – how could such ordinariness take place while countless horrors were happening off camera?The image will be among many in the exhibition David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948–2018 at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art over the summer. The vast exhibition, which was planned and curated before the late South African photographer died in June this year, will include his earliest work, his later portraits of miners, of Afrikaners, of exhausted early morning commuters and those affected by Aids, as well as his numerous landscapes of meaning-laden buildings and the lumbering mines that built the fortunes of the white ruling class thanks to black labourers. Most are in black and white – Goldblatt famously said “Colour was too sweet for apartheid” – and capture seven decades of a country and people ided by racism.Goldblatt didn’t see himself as an artist. As he told the Australian’s Tim Douglas in his last interview: “I am a photographer. I don’t hold exhibitions to glorify my artistic skill. These things I capture in my work are real. I photograph things that are important to me and to ­society. I want the pictures to be seen, because I want the message to be heard. But I’m not in the slightest bit interested in art and the glorification of art for art’s sake. It means nothing to me. I couldn’t give a fuck.”Instead he saw himself as a documentarian. When asked, he explained the purpose of his photographs to his friend and colleague Paul Weinberg: “I was asking myself how it was possible to be so apparently normal, moral, upright – which almost all those citizens were – in such an appallingly abnormal, immoral, bizarre situation. I hoped we would see ourselves revealed by a mirror held up to ourselves.”There is no violence in Goldblatt’s photograph – no schoolchildren fleeing police gunfire on the Soweto streets no bodies strewn on the ground after the Sharpeville massacre. Just everyday life. Goldblatt wasn’t interested in those sort of images he described himself as a coward who would “run away from violence”.Like all South Africans, my family experienced violent crime: my only uncle was murdered in a burglary gone wrong, a 16-year-old neighbour raped and murdered, our home burgled three times. None of these crimes made the headlines, none were exceptional – in fact we would be considered relatively fortunate. But as I stare at the faces in this series, I feel the same old prickling of fear – and the same need to understand. These are the people that committed the terrors that haunt me and they look so ordinary. Like many in South Africa, they aren’t monsters they’re just people who did appalling things.I haven’t been back to South Africa for more than 20 years. The country has moved on in vast leaps but, in my mind’s eye, much of it is frozen in its horribleness, its racism, its misogyny, just like one of Goldblatt’s pictures.But the photographs are also a powerful reminder that while ordinary people went about their daily lives, atrocities were committed and excused in their name. They are a warning that awful things happen on a normal day.• David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948-2018 exhibition will be on at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art Australia from 19 October 2018 to 3 March 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1cf37abafafc6c6298b5fc0d6adfab61df9478/0_681_1882_1129/master/1882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c32d73df0657256976a391689148e6","title":"david goldblatt and the everyday reality of south african racism in pictures","story":"David Goldblatt considered himself a documentarian rather than an artist, and the central concern of his work was apartheid. But rather than the brutal, visceral horrors, his photographs captured the apparently mundane details of daily life in a country ruled by racism, and the result is an eerie, unsettling insight into everyday moral compromise. Now, Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art presents David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948-2018 – a retrospective already commissioned when the artist died in June – that takes in the full scope of Goldblatt’s seven decades of work, from his famous series On the Mines to never-before-seen pieces from his personal archive.

He said that when the news was announced to the Wodehouse Society dinner that the Dean of Westminster had given permission for a memorial to Wodehouse in the abbey, “there was a ripple of joy that it was happening, but also puzzlement that it hadn’t happened before”.“Not that his cap needs any more feathers, but if it did, then here is the highest honour in the land,” said Schott. “He would have been absolutely delighted to be there. He is the personification of a very specific breed of English writing”.The author of almost 100 books, and the creator of characters from Jeeves and Wooster to Psmith, Wodehouse died in 1975, shortly after he was knighted at the age of 93 in what his publishers called a “long overdue” knighthood. Wodehouse had made a handful of ill-advised radio broadcasts in Berlin after he was released by the Germans in 1941. They led to his investigation by MI5, and to his vilification in Britain. He moved to the US and never returned to the UK.The plans, which the abbey said were at a very early stage, will see Wodehouse honoured with a stone. No decision has yet been made on the exact location of the memorial, said a spokesperson for the abbey. More than 100 poets and writers are buried or have memorials in the abbey’s Poets’ Corner, from Jane Austen to CS Lewis.Wodehouse Society chairman Hilary Bruce called the decision “a recognition of Plum’s place in the literary pantheon” and said that “his stone will deservedly lie among those of some of the greatest writers in this country’s history and his own literary heroes”.“People think of his writing as light comedy, but light comedy takes heavy work. It takes tremendous skill to wield words in a light-hearted way,” added Schott. “It’s fitting he will be there with his heroes, such as Trollope, Dickens and Shakespeare, but also alongside Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear. Both of the latter are like Wodehouse, in that you only have to read a line of them and you know exactly who it is. Literature has always ned the high and the low, and it’s a mistake to think there is a huge chasm between them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c765046e5af2b9ac095229731fd2fc3f3076103d/0_316_4006_2404/master/4006.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=987b9b262e6d70586b0ac03828ae828e","title":"i leave the car at home how free buses are revolutionising one french city","story":"Dunkirk is a month into a project that makes it the biggest European city to offer free public transport. So what do people think?One month after the French channel port of Dunkirk introduced free public transport for all, a small revolution is taking place.Two women, perfect strangers until now, are chatting across the aisle about nothing in particular. One admits she sometimes takes the bus “just for the fun of it”. A young man wearing headphones is charging his mobile in a socket just above the “request stop” button.On another bus, Claude Pointart, 65, who is retired, says free buses mean her pension goes further. “I’m saving money and they come every 10 minutes so I don’t have to wait long. But there’s a lot more people taking the bus so you have to avoid the rush hour if you want to sit. Still, I think it’s a good thing.”On a city bus making its way around the historic port city, passengers smile at the driver and say “Bonjour” as they board. Some of the city’s fleet of new buses, painted in dazzling colours – pink, orange, green, yellow and blue, with upholstery to match – have wifi. The urban authorities have plans for debates, music and possibly the occasional celebrity on board. A “Sport-Bus” with an interactive game, quiz screen and a selfie camera is already in operation.Georges Contamin, 51, says he has reconsidered how he travels about the city since the buses became fare-free. “Before, I almost never took the bus, but the fact they are now free as well as the increase in the cost of car fuel has made me reflect on how I get about,” Contamin says.At the bus stop opposite the port, even the persistent drizzle and howling wind rocking the boats cannot dampen Marie’s enthusiasm. “I never used the bus before,” she says. “It was too much bother getting tickets or a pass. Now I leave the car at home and take the bus to and from work. It’s so easy.”One month ago, Dunkirk – with a metropolitan population of 200,000 – became the largest city in Europe to offer free public transport. There are no trams, trolleybuses or local commuter trains, but the hop-on-hop-off buses are accessible and free – requiring no tickets, passes or cards – for all passengers, even visitors .The scheme took its inspiration from Tallinn in Estonia, which in 2013 became the first European capital to offer a fare-free service on buses, trams and trolleybuses, but only to residents who are registered with the municipality. They pay €2 for a “green card”, after which all journeys are free. The city has reported an increase of 25,000 in the number of registered residents – the number previously stood at 416,000 – for which the local authorities receives €1,000 of each resident’s income tax every year.In February this year, Germany announced it was planning to trial free public transport in five cities – including the former capital Bonn and industrial cities Essen and Mannheim. In June this was downgraded to a slashing of public transport fares to persuade people to ditch cars.A study into free public transport by online journal politics found an increase in mobility among older and younger people, and an increased sense of freedom.“The subject of free public transport is full of dogma and prejudice and not much research. This dogma suggests that if something is free it has no value. We hear this all the time in France,” he says.Bus routes have been extended, with special lanes and city centre priority introduced. The fleet has been expanded from 100 to 140 buses, including new greener vehicles which run on natural gas.“The increase in passengers since it went free has surprised us now we have to keep them. We’re trying to make people look at buses differently. We have put the bus back into people’s head as a means of transport, and it has changed attitudes.“Before the bus was for those who had no choice: the young, the old, the poor who don’t have cars. Now it’s for everyone.”Free public transport, however, also has its critics. The French transport union UTP believes fare-free transport is often “associated in France with a lack of value and, by extension, a lack of respect”.In Paris the income from tickets on public transport is reported to make up half the running costs. When mayor Anne Hidalgo suggested she would look at scrapping fares, Frédéric Héran, a transport economist, said the measure “made no sense”.“Who will the new public transport users be?” he asked. “All studies have shown they will be cyclists, then pedestrians and very few motorists. This clearly shows it’s an anti-cycling, anti-pedestrian measure and not very discouraging to cars.”Vergriete believes this is all part of an erroneous received dogma. He admits free public transport may not work everywhere, but says that, as well as being good for the environment, it is a social measure, a gesture of “solidarity” and promotes a more egalitarian redistribution of wealth than tax cuts.“We have been pragmatic: we looked at the advantages of free transport and weighed them against the disadvantages and decided €7m is not a lot to pay for all the benefits. If I can pass one message to other mayors it’s to fight the dogma. Put the advantages and disadvantages on the table and consider it realistically. It may be that the financial cost is too great, but don’t underestimate the social advantages. You can’t put a price on mobility and social justice.”Additional reporting by Emmanuelle DepeckerFollow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be744007a32172b597ad30f65585d5d24b64237b/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513da1281c1caf32fe150f54473b7634","title":"jeremy hunt maze brexit minotaur foreign secretary","story":"The moment over the weekend when the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and his fellow European foreign ministers posed grinning and waving for a picture in the middle of a maze must have been one of those brief pauses of optimism in the Brexit process when a happy outcome seemed just a few laughing circuits of the greenery away – only for Arlene Foster or Jacob Rees-Mogg to appear at the next turn of the labyrinth with axe in hand and a determination to stay entrenched for ever and ever and ever.A softly melancholic autumnal scatter of brown leaves across the emerald hedge-tops hints at winter closing in and the possibility – probability? – that the government’s cursed meanderings will leave Britain by the end of it completely and utterly lost. It was taken at Chevening, a country house in Kent at the prime minister’s disposal, which has a special association with the Foreign Office and whose maze is suggestive of a different age of elite diplomacy, when John le Carré’s George Smiley might have given his latest unsmiling account of the labyrinthine games of cold war espionage to a senior minister among these discreet walks.The maze in this picture may conjure up Alice in Wonderland realms of pastoral delirium, but the fun is surely all under control. The hedges have been freshly trimmed by government gardeners. Hunt and his guests stand under the tree that marks the very centre of the maze and it too is precisely trimmed to create a green cone floating sublimely in space. Far from a world turned upside down, this is a photograph of nature and, by implication, the whole universe under the control of sane human minds. No wonder Europe’s foreign ministers look happy. This Foreign Office maze is a mandarin representation of diplomacy as diplomats like to imagine it: a complex yet ultimately decodable and winnable game.The trouble is that, like their equivalents 104 years ago who might have posed on a croquet pitch or at a grand ball with no idea what the summer of 1914 might come to evoke in history, how cruelly ironic their moustached calm would look in time, these jolly negotiators are not playing the old rational games any more. The balance of power has been replaced by the power of the unbalanced. Nationalist sentiment has once again disrupted Europe’s peace of mind.The sun shines on this maze, infusing its manicured green with life and joy. Yet mazes always had their dark side. The labyrinth of Crete in Greek legend was a lethal subterranean network of caverns haunted by the half-man, half-bull Minotaur. For surrealist artists in the 1930s, who called their magazine Minotaure, the claustophobic maze under the palace of King Minos was a potent image of the violence and chaos of the unconscious that was seeping out into hysterical populist mass politics in the age of Hitler. Picasso even included the Minotaur in his prescient painting of the coming world war, Guernica. Those stranger mazes hide behind this photograph of a civilised garden get-together.The foreign ministers are in sunlight, yet just behind them, as if about to engulf them, is the dark shadow under the radiating tree. They’re comically compressed into their fortress of foliage, with shorter members of the group barely getting their faces above the leaves. This is a poignant image of Hunt and his counterparts looking as if they are sure there is a path out of here. The middle of a maze is a fine place to be when you think it will only take 10 minutes of cheerful fun to negotiate the path. The passages between bright hedge tops look harmless, but their shade seems deep.It would be easy to think this photograph was taken anywhere in Europe. Mazes grow out of the continent’s common heritage. They are depicted in Renaissance art. The palace of Versailles provided the model of the garden maze as a pleasure walk in the 17th century. This maze is part of a European civilisation that Britain gladly joined in the days when aristocrats shaped their gardens to suggest the paintings of Claude Monet.But this is a maze in Kent and these ministers are trying to deal with Britain’s repudiation of our European identity. Jeremy Hunt smiles widest of all, in the middle of the group. Behind him lurks the Brexit Minotaur.• Jonathan Jones writes on art for the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e96a0a6c706da7533fd29d48e9b54cce594ae5d/0_77_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d9e97c3a80b891e28f4444f90fcfab1","title":"meghan royal baby news lovely but a distraction britain needs","story":"The nation increasingly feels little connection to the old elites. Another royal isn’t the rebirth this country is crying out forWomb watch actually started a few weeks ago. I was pretty revolted when people started talking about how “chunky” Meghan looked in a leather pencil skirt on a visit to Sussex. For the royals, any woman with any kind of tummy either signals an appetite beyond all control (Fergie) or, more usually, that they are doing their duty and breeding in captivity.Don’t get me wrong: babies, happy couples, people being in love – I am not untouched by these events. Or I am touched for all of 10 seconds. I mean, well done, Harry, for having sex with your lovely wife! His virility is being praised as though he has special super-speed sperm. Is this discussion of pregnancy tasteful? Of course not, but don’t come to me, a republican – or, indeed, most so-called monarchists – for good taste.Actually, the voyeurism is horrible. God knows, some papers would print a scan if they could. As I said at the time of the wedding, as lovely as Meghan is, as open as Harry has been about struggling with mental health issues, this marriage was a retrograde moment, because the monarchy is an archaic institution that functions to enshrine hereditary privilege. That is its raison d’etre adding dual heritage celeb-charisma does not change that.So, Meghan can now be ogled and scrutinised more than ever, every move she makes will be checked. Did she wear that coat at thingy’s wedding (yeah, I care that much) to overshadow her? Is the Duchess of Cambridge, as some now say, furious with jealousy that she has been knocked off the fecundity ladder? What will the child be called? I am thinking it might not be Thomas or Moon Unit.All of this is utter nonsense, but exactly the kind of nonsense that knocks the dismal lifelessness of Brexit off the front pages.An actual BAYBEE. Seventh in line to the throne. A child of an American immigrant, funded by taxpayers. Rejoice, new England. Poor Meghan will not be able to make the normal choices women make. The hospital, the nannies and the names will all be decided for her. She will be bombarded with unsolicited advice, as all pregnant women are. Should she be wearing those heels? Getting on a plane? There is already a sudden mad concern about Zika. Should she actually leave the palace? I am not convinced she should.Let’s just hope that, unlike the surrendered Kate, she is not made to give birth and pose fully styled-up a few hours later. A strange and unusual torture. For Meghan brings the Firm relaxed charm and a glimmer of modernity. In return, she has to wear awful beige tights and adhere to royal protocol.This has meant a form of muting, but now look! The baby is due after the Brexit deadline of 29 March. A child for a new kingdom. Are you kidding me? It will take much more than that.Some Scottish nationalists are equally unimpressed with the news. What a strange place we are living in right now. A new baby is good news. But whatever that baby represents, the ancien regime is losing its grip.The Queen is very old. Will this new regeneration work? Charles will be king, remember.Meanwhile, we have an impotent political class that is trapped in inertia. The country increasingly feels little connection to the old elites. And, even if this particular elite distracts us with a new and beautiful child, we still need bread, not just circuses.So, lovely news, but surely the rebirth this nation needs is not a charming couple producing another little royal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6deda3ed8d45d6db9a52ac974afa26d42274f0b/0_97_3482_2090/master/3482.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d378054b5d726ac509b2cac36db3cf4","title":"the guardian view on populism belonging not believing","story":"The regional elections in Bavaria resulted in a crushing defeat for the CSU party, which has ruled the province since 1950. It fell from almost half the votes to slightly over a third at the same time its traditional rival (and partner in the national coalition government), the Social Democrats, did even worse and slumped to fifth place. The huge gainers were the Greens, now almost twice as large as the Social Democrats, and after them the anti-immigrant AfD in fourth place.The CSU lost votes to both right and centre more votes to the centre, in fact, than to the populists. But across Europe is it the populist parties that seem to be having their moment now. The word “populist” is a useful label, but it does not entirely explain the power of these movements. This cannot derive only from their most obvious feature, which is hostility to outsiders. There is also the sense of belonging that they produce by combining religion and nationalism to imagine, and so create, communities.This is a deep human instinct. Children spontaneously do it in play. That does not make nationalism or religion primitive, though: in the forms that we know them today both are products of modern society. But neither is necessarily liberal or market-oriented. Both reject the ideal of freedom or self-sufficiency which suffuses the contemporary world. Both see that the inidual derives her value from being part of a larger whole, rather than from being a fundamentally autonomous figure who must choose as freely as possible. In this sense, both are profoundly illiberal.Why is this vision so attractive to so many? The most obvious answer is that it is at least half true. In a world where loneliness is such a huge problem that the British government has added the title of “minister for loneliness” to the burdens of the health secretary, and where the workings of the global economy are entirely unaffected by the sufferings of any inidual caught up in them, it’s natural to understand that community and belonging are the only lasting stores of worth. Two more assertions of the importance of community make the populist vision attractive to some. The first is that you can’t easily choose to leave, or be thrown out. As with traditional families, membership in a populists’ community is not something you can ever wholly resign. “Home is the place where, when you have to go there,  They have to take you in” as Robert Frost’s poem has it – and the poem is itself an argument about the worth of a human being who no longer has any economic value. The second point is that this kind of belonging isn’t earned by any merit. As the poem goes on to say, home is “something you somehow haven’t to deserve”.It may seem that the essence of populist parties is that they deny these rights to others. So they do. The danger is that they may have to do so. Since the belonging that they offer hasn’t been earned, it must be awarded on other grounds that have nothing to do with merit, such as birth, skin colour, or religious allegiance. All three are tangled together in contemporary populism. The AfD and parties to the east of it in Poland and Hungary – as well as the anti-papal Catholics of the League in Italy – use Christianity as a marker to exclude non-Christians and non-whites, all subsumed in the name “Muslim”. This need have nothing to do with theology. Many of the strongest voices for refugee rights in Europe are religious leaders. But Christianity is also a way of situating a community in history and it can be used to assert that strangers have never belonged here just as easily as it can urge that they be welcomed. In England, membership of the Anglican church correlates strongly with hostility to Brexit in the US, white evangelical Christianity is almost united in its support of Donald Trump.How is the progressive left to combat this or to harness these longings to more generous purposes? The European welfare states were once available to all regardless of merit. The Greens still have a story of a better, transformative future to tell alongside the threatened apocalypse. The mainstream left must find its own."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/938331d5e1d2196ad2abd2f24d6363496d3a51cd/5_85_5167_3100/master/5167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=076b18491a2c9d81645944f718a567b3","title":"the scotsman future liberal voice","story":"Around 1840, a distinguished editor of the Scotsman called Charles Maclaren proved, with the help of an equally distinguished Swiss geologist called Louis Agassiz, that there had been an ice age in Scotland 10,000 years before, and that the country had been shaped and marked by something that, until then, people had not been aware of. It was a worldwide scoop, and its central piece of evidence was a vast, scarred rock on Blackford Hill in Edinburgh.With the news that Scotland’s national newspaper, 200 years old last year, is up for sale in a job lot with hundreds of other Johnston Press titles, the metaphors lurking in that piece of Scotsman history are numerous. That vast, scarred rock redolent of meaning, fact, truth, analysis and history could be the Scotsman itself. The paper has punched above its weight internationally (it was a fervent supporter of African nationalism at a time when most other papers followed the government line on “mutiny and disobedience”) and has always been the voice of the Scottish centre, of Scottish culture and aspiration.It is an unbearable paradox that at this Brexit moment, when the Scots look on in bemusement at the chaos in England, a Scottish medium with a great history and track record is being put up for sale with an as-yet-unknown price tag, unknown bidders and unknown liabilities. It’s not as if the country won’t need a national news medium that is honest, skilful and inclusive to help chart the coming years. It won’t necessarily need an asset on some global company’s balance sheet – the fate of too many news media.People who have worked for the Scotsman – me included – tend to have a passionate love for it. In its glory days, overlooking Edinburgh at the top of North Bridge, its great thistle logo facing north to the Firth of Forth (obviously, the building is now a hotel), the paper employed people from across the world as writers, poets, political commentators.It had started life in 1817 as an “incendiary” liberal paper opposed to the reactionary government of the day, and by and large it has kept that openness to other thoughts and opinions. I started writing for it as a student, getting the novels at the bottom of a distinguished literary pecking order to review in brief. The literary editor, Bill Watson, lived in a stately panelled office and kept publishers in a state of high alert for his interest, or not, in their wares.The then editor, the great Eric B Mackay, was a granite-jawed deity of morose mien and incorruptible journalistic morals. He saw off government attempts to influence the Scotsman with adamantine regularity. Would he have been strong enough to face down the destructive drives of capitalist, aggregating global companies?What will happen now to this great brand (as one commentator called it)? One Scottish financier interested in the paper despite its circulation now being about 20,000 says nothing can be decided until Johnston Press reveals details of what exactly it is selling.The story of the buying and selling of the Scotsman, from the Barclay brothers’ asset-stripping purchase in 1995, is an intermittently unhappy one. The question now might be whether there is a group of people – Scots? – who want to see a new form of ownership for a great national paper (on a mutual, cooperative or  trust model) and who can see a way forward in the digital age and negotiate with Johnston Press to see how it will sell the business – whether in parts or as a whole.Edinburgh is still a rich city, said one former editor. But Brexit, he added, as with so much else, means that now might not be the time for vision and expenditure. So the fate of this great institution, summing up so much of the history of a people and with so much intelligent ability to deal with the present and the future, lies clouded in uncertainty.The Scotsman has always punched above its weight. We need it more than ever and should ensure it is enabled to be what it truly could be – a strong national, independent, protected and nourished institution.• Lindsay Mackie is a writer and partner in the NewWeather Institute, which examines social and economic alternatives to neoliberalism"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1da896c4a4a85091deb502fd84b01aa21bfc72/0_253_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd239580e6481217764eb1bf4254626","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of yellow","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘yellow’The closing date is Wednesday 17 October September at 10am.

Key brewing nations are forecast to be among the worst hit, including Belgium, the Czech Republic and Ireland.The researchers said that compared with life-threatening impacts of global warming such as the floods and storms faced by millions, a beer shortage may seem relatively unimportant. But they said it would affect the quality of life of many people.“There is little doubt that for millions of people around the world, the climate impacts on beer availability and price will add insult to injury,” said Prof Dabo Guan at the University of East Anglia, one of the research team. “There is something fundamental in the cross-cultural appreciation of beer.The research, published in the journal Nature Plants, used climate models to examine the impact of extreme weather on barley yields over the next 80 years. The team then used economic models to estimate the impact on beer supply and price in different nations.Looking at the impact on price, the research found that Poland’s beer drinkers would be hardest hit in the worst-case scenario, with the cost rising almost fivefold. In Ireland, Belgium and the Czech Republic, prices would double. These nations would be most affected because they brew and drink a lot of beer and import most of their brewing barley.Only about a sixth of the world barley harvest is used for beer – most is fed to livestock. But the researchers found that the economics of the market mean hungry animals are prioritised when the grain is in short supply. This means disproportionately large decreases in barley for brewing, “ultimately resulting in dramatic regional decreases in beer consumption and increases in beer prices”.“Future climate and pricing conditions could put beer out of reach for hundreds of millions of people around the world,” said Prof Steven Davis, at the University of California, Irvine, and one of the research team.Guan said uncertainties and assumptions made in the study mean the price rises and supply shortages calculated are not intended to be precise predictions but to illustrate the impact of climate change. He said it is clear from the research that global warming will make beer more expensive and less available.Guan suggested beer price spikes and shortages might even affect social stability, noting that the prohibition era in the US saw organised crime supplying illicit liquor.Using other grains such as wheat to brew is unlikely to be an option, as all crops will suffer from extreme weather, said Guan. Nor will what he calls other “luxury essentials” be an alternative source of pleasure: “All these are going to be more expensive – chocolate, coffee and tea – all those crops are going to be suffering.”But he said the study might underestimate the consequences of future climate change on barley yields, given significant recent drops in UK yields after only modest temperature rises.

For us, there’s no point palming off the inevitable – together we must end deforestation.”In April Iceland became the first major UK supermarket to pledge to remove palm oil from all its own-brand foods in a bid to halt the ongoing destruction of tropical rainforests in south-east Asia. It said the controversial ingredient had already been taken out of half of its own-label range, with the rest to be reformulated by the end of 2018.Palm oil – a cheap and mass-produced ingredient renowned for its versatility – is currently found in more than half of all supermarket products, from bread, pastry, biscuits, cereal and chocolate to soap and detergent.But only a small percentage of palm oil comes from an officially approved sustainable source.

Tom Hardy’s unhinged superhero tale – based on a Spider-Man villain, but lacking even a passing reference to the now Marvel-owned web-slinger – is being showered in the viscous black goo of negative critical reviews. Chris Hewitt on The Empire Podcast declared it could set comic-book movies back 10 years and this publication’s Peter Bradshaw said it was “riddled with the poison of dullness”.And yet, people are going to see Venom. Its global box office opening weekend of $205m has doubled its $100m production budget and the mammoth $80.3m domestic bow smashed the $55m record for an October opening previously held by Alfonso Cuarón’s Oscar-winning Gravity. It topped the box office again in its second week and is already within touching distance of the global box office total of Solo: A Star Wars Story.This void between critical and commercial response will be familiar to anyone who followed the fortunes of The Greatest Showman – Hugh Jackman’s all-singing, all-dancing, all-glitter musical biopic of circus impresario PT Barnum. That movie was dismissed by critics as a colourful failure, but that didn’t prevent it from becoming an all-out global phenomenon. It made $430m worldwide and was still playing on cinema screens in its sing-along incarnation until early May, several weeks after it was available to buy on Blu-ray and DVD and months after the behemoth of Star Wars: The Last Jedi made the hyperspace jump out of multiplexes. Its soundtrack also high-kicked into the record books, spending the most weeks at No 1 of any release on the UK album chart for 50 years.Numbers aside, Venom and The Greatest Showman have a great deal in common. They’re both defiantly silly movies arriving in the wake of heavier, more serious counterparts. Showman’s twee sensibility and embrace of glitter-ball camp felt like a response to the bleakly real rise-and-fall relationship dynamic of La La Land, which had been a critical and commercial smash less than a year previously. With its toe-tapping musical numbers and convenient airbrushing of any material that could have been contentious or difficult, The Greatest Showman was like a breath of sugar-scented fresh air for movie fans over the festive period.Venom, similarly, is the latest superhero film to step tentatively into the goliath shadow created by Avengers: Infinity War – a movie that ends with an act of finger-snapping, universe-ning genocide. After that level of heft, audiences can be forgiven for wanting to watch Hardy do not one, but two funny voices and bite the heads off villains’ shoulders as if they’re jelly babies.Much like The Greatest Showman, Venom appears to have been punished for its refusal to meet audience expectations. Prior to the release of Showman, the movie was being talked about as a potential awards contender in the La La Land mould, with Jackman expected to be a major player in the best-actor race and many assuming the best original song Oscar – a gong that was ultimately handed to Pixar’s Coco – was in the bag. The finished film was emphatically not an awards season beast, playing noisily to the cheap seats rather than the rarefied front row.Venom, similarly, was initially promised to comic-book devotees as a violent antidote to the homogeneity of many superhero adventures. Many of those edges, however, were smoothed off in order to net that lucrative teen-friendly PG-13 rating in America, though the movie’s occasionally shocking violence was enough to get it a 15 certificate in the UK. Fans of the violent, edgy 90s comic-book incarnation of the character were never likely to warm to Hardy’s goofy antihero, who talks the violent talk, but seldom follows through with the claret-soaked brio of a Logan or a Deadpool.Those unburdened by these expectations for Venom, though, were seemingly impressed by the movie’s defiant desire to go its own way. In an era in which even the best superhero movies feel as if they are at least cut from the same comic-book cloth, Venom is the partygoer who arrives in a clown outfit when the dress code is black tie.It’s not likely that Venom will infect popular culture in the same way that The Greatest Showman has bled into every inspiring TV musical montage and holiday-camp cabaret act, but the two movies provide a valuable lesson in terms of the value of silliness in cinema. When the world outside is tearing itself apart environmentally and politically, sometimes a hilariously committed Tom Hardy blabbering on about “turds in the wind” while bathed in inky black pixels is exactly what the doctor ordered."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/623239e7183dd0cbd2957439fed20c7406a64d99/0_860_8054_4833/master/8054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b938fa2737c3479e95ccdba6045ecbc2","title":"rachel roddy marinated courgettes with mint and garlic recipe rachel roddy","story":"A rummage among dusty charity-shop bookshelves unearths a gem of a recipe for spicy-sour courgette suffused with the fresh taste of mintFor the past 10 years, some of my best cookbook purchases have been from Oxfam on London’s Marylebone High Street and the Mercatino dell’Usato in Monteverde in Rome. I visit both as often as possible, always feeling the same high on book-buying endorphins as I make a beeline for the cookery shelves.Oxfam is relatively small: you have only to walk a few steps, passing mostly women’s coats and Fairtrade chocolate, to get from the front door to the cookbook section. It’s harder at the Mercatino, which is a warehouse a tetris of antiques and junk, 80-piece crockery sets, novelty ashtrays, designer furniture and old electric guitars. My cookbook endorphin, though, is stronger than the one for Apulian plates and mannequins, even though I am sure a mannequin would come in useful. Will the shelves be exactly the same as the last time, or will there be new arrivals? Has that first edition of A Feast of Floyd been bought? Has someone recently donated a recently passed relative’s entire cookery book collection?After a period in which the shelves in both places stayed more or less the same, a fresh batch of books arrived in both places – at least two dozen in each, the nature of which suggested someone had either downsized or died. While new books smell crisp and inky, secondhand books smell like old wardrobes and vanilla, and come with a history: the immediately obvious one, a name inscribed inside the cover, scribbles in the margin or a fringe of Post-it notes but also the clues that make you feel like a detective – the folds and creases, a smudge of sauce or oily print. Patricia Wells’ Bistro Cooking (one of a five-book haul from Oxfam) belonged to Siobhan in 1993: there are Post-its marking bagna cauda, tartelettes aux pommes and mon gateau au chocolat which, according to the margin notes, is “v good”, “needs 35 mins” and to “see Gary Rhodes page 233”. The mark in a €1 copy of La Cucina Napoletana by Jeanne Caròla Francesconi is both less and more obvious – it simply fell open on page 196, at a recipe for zucchine a “scapece”.Alla scapece, like saor in Venice and carpione in the north of Italy, is a technique of cooking fish or vegetables by first frying and then covering them in a marinade of vinegar, aromatics and herbs. The origin of the word is Spanish – escabeche – a reminder of the Spanish influence in Italian cooking, and dishes cooked alla scapece are often typical of port towns in which this influence first arrived with hungry merchant sailors.The zucchine a scapece of Naples is pretty much the recipe I learned in Rome. Like the stuffed courgettes I wrote about a couple of weeks ago, the mint is vital, like a breath of fresh air up against the soft, oily courgette, vinegar rasp and heat of the chilli. With bread, salami, olives and cheese, zucchine a scapece are one of the greatest antipasti, but also excellent with fish or stuffed into a sandwich. The book suggests a 24-hour wait, but a few hours will do, and I have noted that in the margin of my copy.1kg courgettesOil, for frying (olive or vegetable)1 handful mint or mentuccia150ml red wine vinegar150ml water2 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced1 small, dried red chilli, crumbledSlice the courgettes into rounds roughly 3mm thick. If you have time, spread them on a clean cloth and leave them to sit – ideally in the sun, otherwise any dry place – for an hour, turning after 30 minutes.In a medium frying pan, heat a couple of thumbs of oil and then, working in batches, fry the rounds until lightly golden. Using a slotted spoon, lift the courgettes on to a kitchen towel to blot.When drained, layer the courgettes in a bowl, sprinkling salt and tucking ripped mint between each layer and in the gaps.In a small pan, bring the vinegar, water, garlic and chilli to the boil, and continue to boil for five minutes.Pour the vinegar mixture over the courgettes, along with three tablespoons of olive oil, either from the frying pan or the bottle. Toss the courgettes, cover, and leave to sit for at least an hour – ideally 24 hours.

They have won every match, most of them with ease – their four league games include two 5-0 wins and a 7-0, and this week it was the reigning champions on the receiving end. The major difference this season is how clinical they have been in front of goal, with Vivianne Miedema, who has six goals and four assists already and scored another two at Chelsea, seeming unstoppable. Their best play comes down the middle, with Miedema combining with Kim Little and Jordan Nobbs to cut through their opponents. They only had 11 shots on Sunday, and seven on target, but five of those went in. They are getting the rub of the green in some situations – their third goal was a cross from Nobbs that flew straight in – but that kind of clinical chance conversion demonstrates the confidence bubbling through the team at the moment.If Chelsea wanted to know what their vulnerabilities were, they were laid bare by Arsenal. Last season they were reliant on being offensively dominant, which helped to make up for some defensive vulnerabilities. This season the attack isn’t clicking and not a lot has changed defensively. They actually had more shots than Arsenal, and five on target. Last season, when it was all very fluid, front-foot stuff, they would have converted a few of those, but the confidence has dried up. What is becoming increasingly apparent is that they miss the retired Katie Chapman massively, someone who could drag her team through games, pull them out of situations where they were spiralling towards defeat, someone who would literally do anything, put her body anywhere, to help her team. This season the captain’s armband has been handed around: Karen Carney and Hedvig Lindahl have led the team but both were on the bench this weekend, when Millie Bright got the honour. She’s a good organiser, but that’s a massive responsibility for a relatively young centre-half. The way the captaincy is being handed around suggests that the team is maybe lacking a clear leader.• Chelsea v Arsenal: as it happenedMarc Skinner’s side may not be free-scoring, but the results they are getting this season are remarkable. For the fourth time in five games they won 1-0, to remain level on points with Arsenal. They lost a few players in the off-season – Jess Carter went to Chelsea, and might be regretting that decision now – but Skinner has created a very hard-working, very organised, very disciplined team, and it’s great to see a young manager come in and have such an effect. Bristol City put numbers behind the ball and tried to shut them out, but despite missing a penalty Birmingham eventually came good. It must feel so great to think before the game, ‘Come on, try to beat us.’ Everyone must know their role so well, and as a team that must feel really powerful. Bristol didn’t have a single shot or win a single corner: Birmingham are just so rigid and organised, their defence is extremely hard to breach. There has been a big change since last season and though they have some excellent players – Meaghan Sargeant is emerging as a strong leader and an extremely good young centre-half – Skinner deserves most of the credit.• From Roebuck to Salmon: 10 young English footballers to watchI remember going on a tour of Japan with Caroline Weir when she was 16 years old, and her quality was obvious even then. She was very young when she came through at Arsenal, then moved to Liverpool to play more first-team football, but since switching to Manchester City this summer her game has gone up a level. She seems now to be feeling the freedom to express herself as a footballer. She’s a craftsman, a set-piece specialist, someone with an eye for a pass and the ability to thread balls through. City beat West Ham 7-1 and Weir opened the scoring in the second minute and got a couple of assists. Put simply, if she has a good season then City will have a good season. After a disappointing start they have certainly got their mojo back, and perhaps it has also helped them that the likes of Nikita Parris and Steph Houghton have flourished on international duty and successfully brought that form back with them. With Chelsea at the moment it looks like players are drained when they come back from internationals, but City are proving that you can use those breaks to your benefit.Last season Yeovil lost their first 12 league games without scoring a goal. In 10 league matches since then, across last season and this, they have got a couple of draws and scored four times. The table still doesn’t look very encouraging – after four games they have no points and a goal difference of -13 – but there is improvement there, there is progress. Lee Burch was appointed manager in the summer, and that is a heck of a job. Footballers want to win, whatever team they’re playing for, and Burch has to manage that disappointment, to somehow sustain morale, to take positives from games like Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Liverpool and have them go into their next match feeling they could get something. They could have nicked a point on Sunday – it took an 87th-minute goal from Jess Clarke for Liverpool, with Chris Kirkland still in caretaker charge, to beat them – and this team hasn’t been in that position very often. Yeovil have had to make some huge changes to become a full-time professional team, and the amount of progress they have made in a short space of time has to be commended. Having scored in their first four games as many goals as they did in the whole of last season, they don’t look all that far away from getting a positive result to back that up.• From ‘party girl’ to the Belgian top flight: Emma Coolen’s remarkable riseBT Sport has coverage of the FA Women’s Super League all season.

The Saudi-led coalition has been fighting the rebels since 2015 in support of the internationally recognised government.Thousands of civilians have been caught in the middle, trapped by minefields and barrages of mortars and airstrikes. The resulting humanitarian catastrophe has seen at least 10,000 people killed and millions displaced.Speaking on Sunday evening, Grande said: “There’s no question we should be ashamed, and we should, every day that we wake up, renew our commitment to do everything possible to help the people that are suffering and end the conflict.”Her comments came after the UN and humanitarian workers condemned an airstrike in which the Saudi-led coalition targeted Yemen’s Shia rebels, killing at least 15 people near the port city of Hodeidah.Video footage released by the rebels showed the remains of a mangled minibus littered with groceries following the attack on Saturday, which left 20 others injured.The Houthi rebels reported that five members of the same family were among those killed, adding that many children were among the casualties. “The United Nations agencies working in Yemen unequivocally condemn the attack on civilians and extend our deepest condolences to the families of the victims,” said Grande.She added: “Under international humanitarian law, parties to the conflict are obliged to respect the principles of precaution, proportionality and distinction. Belligerents must do everything possible to protect civilians not hurt, maim, injure or kill them.”Hodeidah, with its key port installations that bring in UN and other humanitarian aid, has become the centre of Yemen’s conflict, with ground troops allied to the coalition struggling to drive out the rebels controlling it.The killing and maiming of civilians including many children in the Red Sea city of has soared in the last three months according to aid workers.Since June more than 170 people have been killed and at least 1,700 have been injured Hodeidah province, with more than 425,000 people forced to flee their homes.A Gulf coalition led by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has been trying to wrestle back control of the strategic port city.If the array of Yemeni militias takes the city it would be their biggest victory against the rebels, although the battle on the Red Sea coast also threatens to throw Yemen into outright famine.Last month Save the Children warned the fighting was turning into a “war on children” with thousands suffering life-changing injuries in the attacks.On a visit to Yemen the charity’s CEO, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, warned attacks on schools and hospitals were on the rise, with children on the frontline of violence and medics unable to cope with the influx of the wounded.Meanwhile the country’s currency has collapsed and food prices have doubled in the last month, fuelling the threat of famine."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3bd6432251b96b76d7dcc913adc23998d11a24/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3598f990b8b813a59016f885cfaec38a","title":"maximalism","story":"After decades of bland minimalism, people are decorating their homes to the max. Is it a response to our troubled times – or inidual expressionism?Outside, Tania James’s home looks fairly average, a flat in a Victorian conversion on a north London street lined with trees and speed bumps. Inside, it’s a riot of colour.Neon pink, yellow and orange zap across the walls, while dozens of 60s and 70s tea trays line the stairs, each a different pattern. In the living room are green and pink sofas with leopard-print cushions. A pink plastic light-up pigeon and a toy plastic horse sit on a shelf alongside a big yellow plastic bird she found in a charity shop. “I was like, oh my God, £4 – that’ll go with the pigeon!” she says. On another shelf sits her brightly coloured glass-bottle collection, which she has been adding to for the past 20 years – “it’s a one-in, one–out policy now”. There is a fireplace painted highlighter yellow, pink and purple, with a baby-sized blue plastic bear standing to attention in the grate. In the bay window, a jungle of house plants spreads its fronds. “I don’t want to say I’m attached to stuff,” says James. “I’m not materialistic – but it’s important to me to have how I feel inside, out.”She understands that the home she shares with her family is “Marmite” – someone once told her: “It’s like 10 cups of coffee with a migraine.” But she loves it. “I work from home and I literally need it,” she says. And while it may sound chaotic, on a sunny Monday morning it feels surprisingly serene.In 2018, James’s maximalism has found its moment. After decades in which the idea of a stylish home tended towards a minimalist aesthetic of pale walls and bare wood, the past few years have seen a decisive turn, with everywhere from Gucci to John Lewis to River Island bringing out flamboyant homeware ranges. Ikea once urged people to “chuck out your chintz”, but last month it launched an accessories collection by artist Per B Sundberg, who describes his work as “lush, rough and burlesque” it includes skull-shaped vases and candlesticks in the shape of poodles.On Instagram, maximalist interiors abound. James is known as Ms Pink on the site (she and her partner run a company called Quirk and Rescue, selling cushions and prints) and she points out the democratic nature of social media you would have had to buy specialist magazines in the past to access anything approaching this range of ideas. But the move towards maximalism also seems to be about other shifts: a reaction to grim political times, and a rejection of the idea of a house as, primarily, a commodity.In the 00s, as house prices rose swiftly, cultural forces, including TV property shows, encouraged home-owners to keep their house beige and bland, the idea being that this would increase its appeal should they ever need to sell or let it. Now there seems to be a move towards making our living space – big or small, rented or owned – into an expression of our personality. In other words, a home.Maximalism can be read as an escape from a world and culture that at times seems bleak. James sees it in part as a backlash against austerity: “People are like, right, what can we do to make ourselves feel good?” The American interior designer Jonathan Adler suggests it’s because “minimalism is a bummer. When you’re about to kick the bucket, you don’t want to look back and see an endless haze of beige.” He says maximalism is about surrounding yourself with things that make you “feel a little bit more glamorous than you think you are”. Rather than more-is-more, he describes this as “glamour-upon-glamour”.Pati Robins, a full-time carer whose maximalist rented home on the outskirts of Cardiff has attracted more than 50,000 Instagram followers, says maximalism for her is about “a collection of things that I love … I have to feel something for them. If something gives me a great joy or any reaction, I pick it up.” When she and her husband first started renting their home from a housing association in 2006, she says it was a nicotine-stained, “magnolia hell, all Scandi and Ikea, all white and empty”. She had moved from Poland with one suitcase and her husband “was a homeless veteran, so he didn’t have many belongings. When you live like someone else is living because you don’t want to stick out too much,” she says, “you end up feeling like a guest in your own home … it was just awful.”Tomris Tangaz, the course director in interior design at Chelsea College of Arts, University of the Arts London, says that during eras when “things get tough, people find ways of negotiating those climates and I think private spaces in particular – your four walls – are the only spaces that are not loaded, that are free of authority and rules”. (There are, of course, often a lot of rules that come with renting a property, which can impinge on tenants’ ability to express themselves, so it’s interesting to see how Robins and many other people on Instagram are finding ways to negotiate that.)Tangaz says there is a sense that our homes represent a rest from the world outside, and while Robins doesn’t want to ascribe too much of her home’s decor to turbulent political times – “I didn’t start maximalism after Brexit,” she says – she does think of it as her “own personal sanctuary. I close the door and I escape the world.” It’s a feeling she says her husband, who suffers from mental health problems, shares. When the house was still empty, “he felt more on edge … it reminded him of hospitals”. Now it is filled with their objects, “he’s a bit calmer”, she says.Her version of the aesthetic feels very different from James’s – her walls are painted dark colours, for instance. In her living room, the head of a donkey juts from a neon pink frame.Maximalism is all about expressing iniduality and personality, and so the cultural reference points are hugely varied. Ben Spriggs, executive editor of Elle Decoration magazine, mentions the colour-saturated worlds of Wes Anderson and the Italian palazzo look of Call Me By Your Name. Both he and James namecheck the 1980s Memphis design movement, with its squiggly patterns and bold colours, especially the aesthetic of its founder, Ettore Sottsass, whose fans included David Bowie and Elio Fiorucci – Sottsass co-designed the latter’s flagship New York store.In Luke Edward Hall’s one-bedroom flat, there are shell-shaped wall lamps, merman candlesticks and so many books that his shelves sag under their weight. He is one of the artists and interior designers most associated with today’s maximalism, and says that at a time when the world can be quite grim, it is about escaping into a fantastical universe.For him, that involves being surrounded by objects that have a story. “It is a way of expressing yourself,” he says, sitting on a mustard yellow sofa. “In the same way I have scrapbooks, it’s a way of having these memories surrounding you.” On a nearby table are small glass anchovies picked up on a trip to the Amalfi coast with his partner on another there are glass chicory and asparagus picked up in Venice. He and his partner “love anything shaped like a fish, vegetable or animal”, he says. His fridge is adorned with magnets of crustaceans, Campari and Botticelli’s The Birth of Venus. In the bedroom, there are palm-print bedsheets and a leopard-print carpet, green wallpaper and pink curtains.For James, one of the most appealing aspects of maximalism is its DIY quality – her living room includes fake cheese plant leaves bought for less than £2 from Ikea and spray-painted neon orange and pink, as well as a customised Mothercare clock from when her children were young. This customisation reminds her of the punk scene she was part of in the 70s: “People are realising that you don’t have to be rich and able to employ an interior designer – you can just get stuff you love and make it look good.”With minimalism there was a clear aesthetic, while maximalism embraces everything from Robins’s dark walls, James’s neon birds, and Hall’s shrimp magnets. “It’s much more personal,” says Tangaz, “much more about what you want to create.” Robins believes people are “getting sick and tired of living like everybody else. I think we just want to be seen as iniduals.” If that means pink walls, orange floors and lamps in the shape of artichokes, so be it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49be11dbdf8a1a37e1335c2d7602f7e1a2d40f6d/0_267_6235_3741/master/6235.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3df815146adb04cf94eb5ce54f0fe773","title":"why i share my breast milk with other mothers","story":"With NHS milk banks often reserved for premature babies, parents are turning to informal networks. It’s time to make the milk-sharing system as efficient as that for blood donationI heard about milk sharing through Facebook, via the page Human Milk 4 Human Babies (HM4HB), which is an informal group for women to share milk with other mothers. One of the veteran pumpers on the group had donated her milk to between 20 and 30 babies and suggested I give it a try. I wrote on HM4HB’s page: “Baby is 20 weeks, five litres to donate, no cigarettes or alcohol,” and was inundated with messages from women willing to collect my milk.Milk sharing has been recorded as far back as Ancient Egypt. More familiar to many people in the form of wet nursing, it was traditionally an informal practice between mothers. In the 19th century, hospitals started building directories of wet nurses whom they could contact should breastfeeding falter, such as when a mother was too ill or her milk had not come in. The first formal milk bank opened in 1939, at Queen Charlotte’s hospital in London, as a place to collect, process and distribute donated milk to sick babies. As the birthing and feeding of infants became medicalised during the 50s, more milk banks opened within hospitals. “There used to be milk banking mechanisms in most hospitals with maternity services,” says Dr Natalie Shenker, the co-founder of Hearts Milk Bank in Hertfordshire. “That’s how sick babies were largely fed in hospitals until the 80s.”However, the development of formula milk – which became widespread due to heavy marketing campaigns and cheap supply to hospitals – caused donations to dry up. When the HIV crisis hit, it almost eradicated milk banks entirely, because the infection could be carried in mothers’ milk by the 90s, only the six milk banks with pasteurisers remained. If you were unable to breastfeed, you had little choice but to use formula.There are 16 NHS milk banks in the UK, 14 in England and one each in Northern Ireland and Scotland. They are closely regulated. Donating mothers are screened for viruses, then their milk is tested, pasteurised and tested again before being distributed. Almost all the banks are funded by the NHS and contained within hospital neonatal wards. This means that NHS donor milk is extremely difficult to obtain and that funding for it is usually limited to babies who are born extremely prematurely. This is how informal groups such as HM4HB came about. Set up in 2010, the network has 130 local Facebook pages and more than 20,000 members. “Through our pages, hundreds of babies in need receive breast milk every single day,” it states on its website.Harriet Tutton has donated milk informally through HM4HB for more than two years, since the birth of her daughter Luna. Her first recipient was an expectant mother who had previously experienced breastfeeding problems she drove for five hours to collect the milk. “Her baby came 10 weeks early. Luckily, it was two weeks after I had given her milk. She didn’t have to supplement with formula, because she had milk ready and waiting for her baby,” Tutton says.Anne (not her real name), an NHS speech and language therapist, says that some health professionals frown on donor milk. She recalls going to visit the mother of one baby and noticing on the file that the woman had been reported to social services by hospital nursing staff for sourcing milk from another woman, despite the fact that it is legal. “What I discovered was that none of the staff felt confident or skilled enough to sit the mother down to ask the right questions. When I spoke to the mother, she was just desperate to do what was best for her baby. I don’t think she was producing any milk. It was the best of intentions.”If milk sharing were better funded, women would not have to take the risks associated with informal sharing. It was after I had donated to four women who contacted me on Facebook that I heard about Shenker’s Hearts Milk Bank, which is aiming to transform the way milk is collected. Set up in 2016, it is the only formal milk bank in the UK not run by the NHS. It accepts donor milk from women across the country, rather than regionally, as with local hospital milk banks.The drawback is that Hearts Milk Bank can distribute only to women who have been given funding for donor milk on the NHS, so in August it helped set up a charity called the Human Milk Foundation, which provides grants for parents to access donor milk when they have been turned down. Previously, “there was no way in the NHS to make sure that milk could be provided, beyond the most extremely premature babies”, says Shenker. “That’s really the issue that we are trying to tackle.” Shenker wants the milk banking system in the UK to be as efficient as the blood service. “The blood transfusion service has two centres where they can process blood, but you can give blood and receive blood anywhere in the country. There is no reason why that can’t exist for milk banking,” Shenker says. Chester milk bank is already employing this system, managing about 15 depots around the country where mothers can donate milk.“The idea is not to expand the banks, but to expand the knowledge about donation so that it becomes the norm,” says Tanya Cassidy, a researcher at the University of Central Lancashire who has co-written a book on the subject, Banking on Milk. The way to alleviate the risks of informal sharing, Cassidy says, is for informal sharing sites such as HM4HB to work alongside NHS milk banks. Shenker agrees that the plan should be to make the existing milk banks more efficient, rather than to open more of them. However, the Department of Health has no plans to change the way milk banks are funded, which Shenker believes is a false economy. She points to a World Health Organization study from 2014 that compared the effects of formula milk versus donor breast milk on babies with a low birth weight. While the formula-fed babies gained weight quicker than those on breast milk, their risk of necrotising enterocolitis – a serious inflammation of the intestine – almost tripled. Shenker says it would cost the NHS roughly £250,000 to treat one baby with necrotising enterocolitis until the age of five. In contrast, she believes she would need £1m to get a national milk service, with four banks across the country, off the ground. “Four necrotising enterocolitis cases saved by the babies being fed with an exclusively human milk diet could potentially pay for a national milk banking service,” Shenker says.Changing the perspective on milk sharing, and helping to raise funds to make it safer and more efficient, can only be beneficial to the overall health of the UK. “We’re not talking about a small impact,” says Shenker.Shenker says mothers are far more likely to go on to breastfeed when they receive donor milk, rather than formula, when trying to iron out breastfeeding problems. These can include delayed lactation, issues with building supply, waiting for tongue-tie surgery or dealing with allergies. My sister Scarlett needed extra milk while she focused on increasing her supply. Advised by her midwives to pump after every feed, she was either feeding her daughter directly or attached to her pump. The weight gain was slow. “There was a lot of pressure on me I absolutely dreaded every weigh-in,” she says.The midwives suggested formula supplementation. Luckily, my niece is five months younger than my daughter, so I donated some of my extra milk. Scarlett is now six months into breastfeeding exclusively and has no plans to stop in the near future. “There wasn’t that intense pressure on me any more it gave me the space to step back and concentrate on getting to know my baby, myself, my body and what was happening with my milk supply.” Now that her supply is fully established, Scarlett is building her own freezer stash and hopes to donate milk in the future. “It’s such a selfless act and, for the mum who is receiving it, they are going through such a difficult time – having any sort of support and help is vital.”For me, donating is not selfless. Empowering another mother’s feeding journey, or supplementing their child with some breast milk, was what healed my grief around my breastfeeding experience. Whenever I dread pumping, I remember that my milk has helped so many women and their babies. If this were the norm, if mothers were supported to donate and receive donor milk, if milk banks received better funding, imagine the health benefits this country would reap."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de0c5fb284e3b8f2b04afdae8b4873157d57a174/0_23_2019_1211/master/2019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05545be7f6e68829057f35036a61a0fd","title":"brexit eu insistence on northern ireland backstop unacceptable may tells mps","story":"PM rules out agreeing anything that ‘threatens the integrity of our UK’ as talks hit impasse Theresa May has declared she “cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom” as she told sceptical MPs the EU’s insistence on retaining the Northern Ireland backstop was unacceptable.The prime minister said while she had proposed the UK would remain in a countrywide “customs solution” as an alternative, the EU had told her there was not enough time to work out the detail in the next few weeks.Brussels negotiators had demanded the existing Northern Irish backstop – in which part of the UK would remain in the customs union after Brexit – be retained even though it had been rejected by the government.“The EU still requires a ‘backstop to the backstop’ – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy. And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed,” May told MPs on Monday.“We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom. And I am sure the whole house shares the government’s view on this.”The prime minister appeared in front of MPs for an hour and 40 minutes, in a hastily scheduled statement in which she was peppered with questions on the progress of negotiations from sceptical members on both sides of the house.May heads to Brussels on Wednesday for a critical two-day European summit, where EU leaders have to decide if sufficient progress is being made in the Brexit talks to hold a concluding summit in November, and whether to abandon their proposed Northern Ireland backstop in favour of her alternative.The prime minister will speak to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, on Monday night, as she tries to lobby EU leaders to change their minds about the backstop. No 10 said she had also spoken to the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, in recent days.May said she also needed to ensure her proposed backstop, known as the “temporary customs arrangement”, was time-limited: “I need to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution.”The issue of how to time-limit the backstop has caused concern in the Conservative party, with some in the cabinet calling for a firm date, while others have indicated the UK could propose a mechanism by which the backstop would disappear using other criteria.“People are rightly concerned that what is only meant to be temporary could become a permanent limbo – with no new relationship between the UK and the EU ever agreed,” May told the Commons.She told MPs talks were entering the final stages. “This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail and it’s the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed,” she said.The prime minister insisted “real progress” had been made on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on future relations, and there had been a “great deal of inaccurate speculation” about how the talks were progressing.“I continue to believe that a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and for the European Union. I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable. And that is the spirit in which I will continue to work with our European partners,” she said.Jeremy Corbyn urged May to “put the country before her party” and stand up to the “reckless voices” on the Tory benches.Amid heated scenes in the Commons, the Labour leader said: “For too long, this country has been held hostage to those in her party who want to drive through a race-to-the-bottom Brexit deal that lowers rights and standards, sells off our national assets to the lowest bidder.“It is clear that the prime minister’s failure to stand up to the warring factions of her own side have led to this impasse.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab9a512bdf371eae2d4621af9f913cda7d4c84b5/0_55_5314_3189/master/5314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a59bfd9330183fac5ece965e69af10","title":"what is the brexit backstop","story":"Negotiations have hit an impasse over the solution to avoiding a hard Irish borderOnce more commonly heard in talk about baseball than politics, the backstop has become one of the most discussed and contentious elements of the Brexit negotiations. It is a simple basic principle, but no one is able to agree precisely how it will work.Variously described as an insurance policy or safety net, the backstop is a device intended to ensure that there will not be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, even if no formal deal can be reached on trade and security arrangements.It would mean that if there were no workable agreement on such matters, Northern Ireland would stay in the customs union and much of the single market, guaranteeing a friction-free border with the Republic.Both the UK and EU signed up to the basic idea in December 2017 as part of the initial Brexit deal, but there have been disagreements since on how it would work.The first is over where it will apply. The EU wants the backstop to affect only Northern Ireland.Even though the aim is for it to never come into force, Theresa May has ruled out the idea of separate customs arrangements for Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK – the so-called customs border in the Irish Sea – and it would be completely unacceptable to the DUP.May has tried to argue that the backstop could apply to the whole of the UK, but this angers Conservative MPs, who dislike the idea of the country being tied to EU rules in the long term.The UK has sought to make the backstop time limited, but Brussels argues this is impossiblebecause the guarantees it offers are needed for as long as an alternative solution is not found.This is the idea, being briefed by UK government sources on Monday, that Brussels is said to be seeking if it agrees to a UK-wide backstop. This would be a secondary guarantee, covering just Northern Ireland, if the first incarnation fails.This has again been rejected by No 10, because it leaves the possibility open of customs ergence between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.The idea is being held up as the reason talks have stalled ahead of this week’s EU summit, but this has been met with some scepticism in Brussels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d9503699f77d1242b7c3ed13e7bd25ffa2f0ac/73_201_3397_2038/master/3397.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b47262c29d6b564882e349c9cfff67c","title":"brexit uk accuses eu of trying to impose backstop to the backstop politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenI’ve summarised the main points from Theresa May’s opening statement already. (See 4.36pm.) But, as is often the case with these statements, some of the most interesting material came in the questions that were thrown at her, and in what she said in response. Here are the highlights from those responses.We are working to get a good deal with the European Union. If it were the case that at the end of the negotiation process actually it was a no deal, that both sides agreed that no deal was there, than actually that would come back to this House, and then we would see what position this House would take in the circumstances of the time.It was not clear what May meant by her answer, but in her Conservative party conference speech she told Brexiters that if they did not back her plan, they could end up with no Brexit, and so it is in her interests to talk up the prospect of a second referendum taking place. However it is very hard to see how a referendum could take place without the government allowing time for the legislation setting one up - and, given everything else she has said on this, it is difficult to imagine a government led by her actually doing this.I do not believe that we should be extending article 50.But May did not categorically rule it out. (I have taken out a heading in an earlier post saying she was unequivocal about this.)Will she confirm today ... that a proposed backstop that would see Northern Ireland carved off in the EU customs union and parts of the single market, separated through a border in the Irish Sea from the UK’s own internal market, could never be accepted by her.When the UK leaves the European Union, it will be the UK that leave the European Union. We will be leaving the European Union together.She also explained that this was why she could not accept the EU’s “backstop to the backstop”. Afterwards Dodds seemed to welcome her clarification.That’s all from me for tonight.Theresa May will speak to French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday evening ahead of the European Council meeting, Downing Street has confirmed. As the Press Association reports, Macron told a press conference in Paris that he would discuss Brexit with the prime minister ahead of Wednesday’s two-day summit. Her official spokesman confirmed they were to speak by telephone, and said she had also recently spoken with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch premier Mark Rutte. He added:She has had, as she does ahead of any European council summit, conversations with some European leaders in recent days and she will be having more in the days to come.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said today that Brexit is looking “a bit more difficult”, Reuters reports.Here is some Twitter comment on May’s statement.From the ’s Jessica ElgotFrom the Spectator’s Katy BallsThese are from the BBC’s Adam Fleming in Brussels.I will be posting reaction and a summary soon.This is from the Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds.The Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle asks May to back the principle of a “third referendum”. People normally refer to a second one, but he is taking the 1975 one as the first, and the 2016 one as the second.May says she has made her views known already.In a blog on May’s statement the New Statesman’s Stephen Bush says there is an inherent contradiction in what May is saying about the Irish backstop (see 4.36pm) that makes a no deal Brexit more likely. Here’s an excerpt.May acknowledged that the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland require an “insurance policy” as far as the border goes, but then proposed a series of measures that would hole that insurance policy below the waterline: by giving a future British government a variety of ways to extricate itself from the process. Of course, the point of the backstop is to guarantee that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland remains unchanged come what may: by definition if it contains ways that the United Kingdom can exit unilaterally, that no longer applies.Labour’s Toby Perkins says there are almost no MPs in the Commons who back May’s Chequers plan.May says there was a very real debate during the referendum. She believes delivering on that vote is a matter of faith in politicians.Alberto Costa, a Conservative, asks May to repeat the commitment she made in her Downing Street statement after Salzburg to guarantee the rights of EU nationals living in the UK in the event of there being no deal.May says she is happy to repeat that commitment.Here is the full text of May’s statement.Martin Whitfield, the Labour MP, asks May to rule out an indefinite backstop with a notice period.May says she will not agree to an indefinite backstop. She reads out again what she said on this in her opening statement. (See 4.36pm.)Charlie Elphicke, the suspended Tory now sitting as an independent, asks if the UK will have to pay more than the £39bn agreed if it effectively stays in the customs union after December 2020.May says Elphicke is referring to the UK-wide backstop, not to the transition. But she says she hopes that will not prove necessary.Labour’s Geraint Davies says the Tories have broken the promise in their 2015 manifesto to stay in the single market. So shouldn’t there be a people’s vote.May says she has answered this already."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c49d054419c7139c5a287929403c4c5c54af40/0_32_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c86b84460a676b12ed9e249bf7473ab","title":"earth science in our lives photography competition winners 2018","story":"The Geological Society of London has announced the results of its 2018 Earth Science Week photography competition.

According to audience-monitoring charity Audience Agency, younger people are in such short supply at the theatre that the typical crowd’s average age is 52 years old. This lot, it seems, are the exceptions.The group are taking a week-long theatre course that’s part of ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative, which works in partnership with the Prince’s Trust, to give people aged 16–25 not in education or employment a leg-up. The initiative includes starter courses in all sorts of digitally-focused creative industries that you might expect the younger generation to opt for instead of fusty old theatre, so what’s the allure of this most analogue of mediums?“It’s an evolving art form, which fascinates me,” says 21-year-old Freddie Apperly. “What’s considered the norm of theatrical practices today, could be old school and prehistoric in 20 years’ time.” Considering the proliferation of immersive theatre, and the cross-pollination of mediums evident in entertainment such as Secret Cinema and escape rooms, it’s hard to disagree with him.For Laurie Weston, 22, a grounding in theatre is the ideal way to pick up transferable skills. “It’s a great way to learn collaboration and teamwork,” he says. “You’ve got actors who bounce off each other, then you’ve also got people who design the set, sound and lighting who all have to work closely together to get the cues right.”To other young people, the very fact that theatre isn’t a primarily digital medium is all part of the appeal. “Curiosity drove me because I just wanted to know how it works,” says 18-year-old Harry Bell, who’s keen to get backstage to find out more about sound and lighting. “I went to see Chicago with school – now, I can’t remember a thing about Chicago, but I just remember thinking: ‘How are they getting those actors’ voices from there to my ears?’ I wanted to know how it worked, the acoustics of the theatre, I wanted to understand that.”As well as a reputation for appealing to older generations, theatre also carries an image of inaccessibility and elitism at a grassroots level. And while today’s would-be thesps are well aware of the barriers to entry, it seems these are not enough to put them off. For 20-year-old Danni Manley, it just means being more selective about the doors you try to shove your foot in. “I went to apply for drama schools, but you have to pay to audition and I couldn’t afford them all, so I only did two out of three,” she says. “It’s quite annoying. It doesn’t put me off, it just makes it harder.”Bell, for one, is taken by a medium that offers an alternative to the polished, nipped and tucked output of most digital media consumed through a screen. “With theatre, you can’t really fix anything in post,” he says. “You have to get it right, there and then. That’s definitely something I want to do, without a doubt in my mind.”To find out more about ŠKODA’s Driver’s Seat Initiative visit skodadsi"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcea54fddc362db29806267451127267b580c543/0_127_8167_4900/master/8167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399ff83ffcd61f37e8bff8e7ca41db77","title":"stephen hendry yips snooker interview","story":"“It was a mixture of embarrassment, anger, frustration, sadness, everything,” Stephen Hendry says as he remembers how his dominance of snooker unravelled into, in his mind, a shambling wreck of a game. When the end came, in the quarter-finals of the 2012 world championships, Hendry was so besieged by psychological demons “there was nothing positive left”.Hendry’s favourite sportsmen are Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Nick Faldo and AP McCoy and he was once as imperious as they had been. He holds the record for the most world titles, with all seven being won in the 1990s, and he was world No 1 for eight successive seasons. But the great champions feel it most when vulnerability takes over.“It started about 12 years before the end,” Hendry says of his slow decline. “Of course it’s psychological and, when you strike a cue ball, you’re supposed to accelerate through the ball. But as you tighten up you end up decelerating. By 2012 my game was shot. You’re sitting on your chair watching players leagues below you play shots you can’t. That destroyed me.”In his new book, which provides graphic insight into this implosion, Hendry accepts that people compare his condition to a golfer’s ‘yips’. He scrunches up his face. “That trivialises it. I hate the word because it’s much more than that.”It resulted in humiliation for Hendry. He had to qualify for his final world championship by playing at the Institute of Sport in Sheffield instead of his beloved Crucible. “It felt degrading. That’s no disrespect to other players but I had owned the Crucible for a decade with seven wins and two finals.”Hendry ground his way through qualifying and in the first round against Stuart Bingham at the Crucible he sank a 147 maximum. Hendry had already decided to retire and become an ambassador for 8-ball pool in China. “I got to the Crucible having flown to China and back, with one day there to meet my new employers. Somehow the 147 came about. It was amazing because, of the 36 shots, only six were played properly. My game had debilitated so far it was mostly shots I wasn’t hitting properly. I’d given every shot a pint of blood to get it in the pocket. The outsider was probably saying, ‘That’s amazing.’ Inside, it felt horrible.”He beat John Higgins in the second round but, 3-0 down to Stephen Maguire in the quarters, it was over. “Clearing up in the fourth frame, I knew if I didn’t get perfectly on the blue I’d leave myself this pink. So consequently, on the brown, you’re thinking about two shots later and ‘I can’t play it.’ I was finished.”He admired the way in which Woods, at his most swaggering, rarely looked surprised or elated when winning. “I really empathise with that. When you get a trophy why go jumping and crying? Winning’s a great feeling but everything else is an anticlimax. I really had to force a smile because winning was my job.”In his book Hendry details the way in which his manager, Ian Doyle, controlled him. Doyle even made Hendry break up with his girlfriend, Mandy, because he believed the young Scot should be consumed by snooker. Later, when he had finally married Mandy, Hendry horrified Doyle by mixing with other players. But Hendry believes now that losing his Ice Man image undermined him.“Without a doubt. In the 90s I never socialised with other players. That changed. I wanted to spend more time in the players’ lounge. I became friendly with Mark Williams. There’s no doubt it affected my invincibility. Ronnie O’Sullivan is still the best player in the world on his day now and he doesn’t mix with the players. You need that coldness. But I missed out as a teenager and thought: ‘I want to enjoy being with people and going out for dinner.’ It was to my detriment as a competitive animal.”During his 26-year career Hendry straddled different eras and faced a range of compelling players from Alex Higgins to O’Sullivan. He describes how drink once ran through the game. “Jimmy White and the others would have half a lager while playing. Bill Werbeniuk had to start drinking four hours before a match. He had this condition where he either took beta blockers, which were banned, or alcohol to calm his heart rate. If he had a match at 10 in the morning, he got up at six to start drinking beer. Alex obviously liked to drink. Sometimes we practised and he used the table to hold himself up. But he still played unbelievable snooker.”Higgins was initially kind to Hendry but “it turned to resentment. He directed it at Steve Davis and then me because Alex believed he made snooker. In a way he was right. But when he wasn’t as good as us he couldn’t cope.”Hendry was still disappointed when many younger players failed to travel with him to Belfast for Higgins’s funeral in 2010. He feels even deeper affection for White, his boyhood hero, whom he beat in four of his seven world championship final victories.He smiles with nostalgia rather than in judgment. “Kenny Dalglish said: ‘Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.’ Jimmy was an amazing loser. I’m sure inside he was devastated but he never showed it. If I’d had lost that final, I would be inconsolable.”Hendry was still a teenager when Davis demolished him in every frame of a six-game exhibition. “I hated it, losing to Steve night after night but I would do the same in his position. I’d be willing to kill the young upstart every night.”Davis did not compliment Hendry when the Scot finally beat him – and Hendry shared that mentality. “I’d practised with John Higgins for years and when he became world champion I couldn’t congratulate him. A normal person says: ‘Well done.’ I couldn’t. It didn’t matter if it was my best friend, my brother, I didn’t want anyone else to win. It still hurts me, watching people win at the Crucible. Steve let it go years ago. That’s why he played longer than me. He treated it as a day out. I could never do that.”Hendry and O’Sullivan have fallen out occasionally but now “we get on”. Mates is probably too strong a word because Ronnie is complex. There are times you’ll be his best friend and times he’ll virtually not say hello to you.”There is, instead, respect and rivalry. “Ronnie’s the best player I’ve ever seen and people forget I actually played him. I was obviously on my way down and he gave me some hammerings.”Hendry responds emphatically when asked what would happen if he and O’Sullivan met each other at their very peak. “I believe I would win. If we had a four-session match, where things change, I would back myself every time. I was stronger mentally. But he’s more talented than me, making shots left-handed and sinking a 147 in 4½ minutes. My fastest maximum would be over nine minutes.”Flying to China 15 times a year, to promote Chinese pool, and working as a UK snooker pundit, Hendry admits that, “compared to the 1990s life now is dull. Back then you were the world’s best player. Nothing could touch you. I’ve not got a bad life now but I have days where I think: ‘What is there to look forward to? What’s the buzz?’”He takes solace in his belief that, as arguably the greatest snooker player in history, his world championship record of victories remains safe. “I can’t see anyone beating it. O’Sullivan’s got five. He can do it if he keeps playing. But there are four others playing at that level. At his absolute best Ronnie wins. But he’s getting to that age where he’s not doing it often. He’ll talk all sorts of bullshit, saying he doesn’t care about the record. But deep down he wants to beat me while, of course, I want to hold on to the record.”Hendry sounds, briefly, like a perennial winner again. But he is too likeable now not to give in to honesty as, considering his involvement in a new senior circuit, he admits his game is still ruined. “I’ve played it a few times and in practice I’m fine because no one’s watching. But once it starts I’m totally embarrassed by my shots. It’s horrible.”The 49-year-old former world champion laughs ruefully. He then shakes his head when asked if he will ever free himself of these demons. “There’re probably people out there who think they can cure me but it’s a mental thing. At exhibitions I have a couple of drinks before I play to relax. It works sometimes but that’s not a way out. I have to live with it now.”Stephen Hendry’s Me and the Table is available from bookshop"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac35e8c73279572a79d57051c8947c7bac691324/0_112_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13ac260de69e7f70cad48cb39b2650cd","title":"andrew lloyd webber wall of fame london palladium cliff richard","story":"Installation by the stage door honours stars including Bruce Forsyth, Cilla Black and Cliff RichardAndrew Lloyd Webber has unveiled a “wall of fame” installation on the exterior of the London Palladium, the venue that became internationally famous for hosting variety performances, including a long-running Sunday night show broadcast on ITV.Lloyd Webber was joined by four of the stars whose portraits feature on the “wall of fame”: Jimmy Tarbuck, Tommy Steele, Des O’Connor and Cliff Richard. “Three of my boyhood heroes,” joked Tarbuck, turning to his company: “Mother loved the three of you.”The stainless steel installation, situated to the side of the stage door in Great Marlborough Street, was designed by Lee Simmons and commissioned as part of the renovations to the building’s Grade II-listed facade. A committee comprising Lloyd Webber, TV veteran Michael Grade, lyricist Don Black and agent Laurie Mansfield chose the first artists to be honoured. The criteria stipulate that, to be included, artists must have performed in more than two major seasons at the Palladium. Bruce Forsyth, Judy Garland, Cilla Black, Tom Jones, Sammy Davis Jr and Vera Lynn are among those featured on the wall, which includes several blank spaces to accommodate the stars of the future.Lloyd Webber said the Palladium was the first theatre in London that he visited as a child. Recalling his outing to see Norman Wisdom play Aladdin, he described the theatre as “the most extraordinary place anywhere that I’d ever been”.The Palladium, designed by Frank Matcham, opened on Boxing Day in 1910. Lloyd Webber acquired it in 2000 as one of 10 venues he bought from Stoll Moss Theatre Group for £87.5m. It has since hosted a revival of his musical Cats and revived its long dormant panto tradition.

It’s Google’s fourth completely private undersea cable, following two short-distance tests, named Alpha and Beta, and the long-distance Curie cable – named after the famed physicist Marie Curie – that links the US west coast to Chile. That cable, which will come online in 2019, will make Google the first major non-telecom company to build a private intercontinental cable.

In this case, building the cable privately allows it to ensure that its landing points are as close as possible to its Belgian and North Virginian data centres.“The role of submarine cables is often overlooked, despite their central role at the heart of our digital world,” said Stéphane Richard, the chairman and CEO of Orange. “I am extremely proud to announce this collaboration with Google to build a new, cutting-edge cable between the USA and France.”Orange said the partnership will leave it “in a stronger position to support the development of new uses for its consumer and enterprise customers in Europe and America”.Including consortium-led projects, Google has another seven cables coming online over the next two years, connecting locales such as Hong Kong, Guam, Australia, Ireland, Denmark and California."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5001abb1afeb1bbc486382d678bffe582140340c/0_0_500_749/master/500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2829a107eee584863d440a3e8ece646d","title":"happy 60th birthday blue peter former guest peter purves john noakes valerie singleton","story":"As a young girl, Zoe Williams sang carols on the show as a man threw fake snow in her face. She recalls her favourite moments, from the out-of-control Brownie bonfire – to Anthea Turner’s cardboard Thunderbirds islandBlue Peter was created exactly 60 years ago by a man with a name like a limerick, John Hunter Blair. Despite its high formality – presenters buttoned up like teachers, voices like newscasters but more cheerful – the show had a radical format. It took a novel view of children, regarding them as an audience with their own tastes and interests, rather than as interim humans to be quieted while you waited for them to see sense.The one constant across the decades has been viewer participation, with its rather broad invitation to send in literally anything interesting – a poem perhaps, or a fascinating rock. Or even yourself: for to be invited into the studio for any purpose was, and perhaps remains, the most exciting thing that could happen to a child. And that’s what happened to me in 1983.My primary school was chosen to be one of the providers of carollers at Christmas – except it wasn’t Christmas when we went along, and it wasn’t snowing. Filming took place in November and there was a guy standing in the wings throwing fake snow at us as we stood there singing and feeling baking hot under our bobble hats. It was still exhilarating, even though it carried within it the seeds of disillusionment, since setting foot in a studio – vast, grimy, grey doors, men with tools constantly shouting for silence – kills the magic for ever.You may lose your enchantment but, in return, you gain admission to the inner sanctum. We all got to crowd around Goldie to say hello, which gave me a lifelong prejudice against golden retrievers, so characterless and unreactive (but maybe that’s a good thing if your job means meeting a lot of kids). And we all got a silver Blue Peter badge that I’m just going to pretend I still have. The sense of belonging was very deeply planted: not that the show belongs to me, but that I belong to it.Peter Duncan was my era’s frontman, joining in 1980, along with the unremarkable but peculiarly memorable Sarah Greene. He spoke to me over the phone for this piece, with a BBC press woman in on the call. “Well, us minor celebrities do need protecting,” he started and I thought: “You’re not minor to me.” He saw Blue Peter as driven by principle: “A kind of honesty. The young person could tune in and believe in the presenters and believe in the subjects that were being discussed.”At first this seems like a given, something all children’s TV should be putting into practice. After all, what kind of snake goes on TV to lie to children? But then Duncan connects this thought to its antithesis: “Everybody’s selling something and that has such a powerful influence over young people’s lives. The world treats them as fresh product. What an organisation like the Beeb should be doing is enhancing the experience of being alive. If I were them, I would take Blue Peter and model it in a way to counter that exploitation – and turn it into a world brand for children, a place where they’re not marketed to.”The Blue Peter of today, if anything, has become more overtly pro-social, beyond the periodic charity appeals, with environmentalism at its heart and mountains of green badges to give out. But commercialism isn’t just the raw act of selling: it has an attention-grabbing visual language, a frenetic pace, a flattening out of complexity that non-commercial TV feels bound to mimic. So when you see today’s presenters, Lindsey Russell and Radzi Chinyanganya, doing crafts, they’re not so different from the YouTube crafters that today’s nine-to-12 age bracket is so fascinated by – except they’re less sweary, of course, less devil-may-care, and in sad consequence a lot less interesting.Whereas if you think about the golden years of Blue Peter crafting – the decade in which “Here’s one I made earlier” became a catchphrase that made everyone laugh not so much in mirth as in comradeship – it had an almost explicitly anti-consumerist agenda. Why go out and buy Christmas decorations when you can fashion a star yourself with two coat-hangers and some tinsel from last year, and bring the exciting risk of fire into your home for free?The most popular craft event ever, with 100,000 viewers writing in for the instruction sheet, was Anthea Turner making Tracy Island in 1993, an incredibly complex rendering of the Thunderbirds base involving a tray, a load of cardboard, and even more silver foil. You can actually watch this now on YouTube, speeded up to take 30 seconds, but it’s much more rewarding to Google the original instructions, all 11 mind-boggling pages of them. Few things better encapsulate the early-upcycling, trash-foraging, brand-name-avoiding brilliance of the show. Instruction 13 reads: “Glue the building to the cheese box lid.” (The one that says Philadelphia on it.)Over the years, the presenter units broke up and reconstituted, so you could place yourself solidly in John Noakes’s era but have no recollection of Peter Purves, his original straight man. Purves was always miffed about this framing, by the way. “People seem to remember me as the quiet one who didn’t take risks, but that’s unfair,” he broke his silence to observe 10 years ago. He had a brief fling with co-presenter Valerie Singleton. I pass this information on for no reason, and certainly not because I intend to list all the scandals of the show.Blue Peter has nostalgia in its DNA, as any watercooler television does that is aimed at people going through growing up. Konnie Huq, the longest-serving female presenter, having appeared from 1997 to 2008, told me: “All the time, all the time, people come up to me and say, ‘I grew up with you.’”Blue Peter reminiscence is a strangely constant touchpoint. A 1980s audience will be at least as familiar with the elephant incident of 1969 as they are with their own defining cultural moments. And that incident has been mischaracterised, incidentally: the funniest bit about Lulu the elephant was not that she took a dump, because all animals do that, nor even that she stood on John Noakes’s toe, because so many people must have wanted to, but that she capered about recklessly – and for one intoxicating moment, it felt like anything could have happened.The BBC is digitising its archive, putting out a broad call for everyone’s favourite moment. Let’s be honest: not every one was golden. There was a lot of planting “time capsules” and then digging up soggy bits of paper with pretend awe. But I would definitely watch the 1970 episode, when it was the Brownies’ turn to do the carols, standing around a far-too-vigorous bonfire with a load of firefighters trying unsuccessfully to stay out of shot. I would watch Tony Hart doing anything, for ever, while Noakes, with his lack of inhibition or impulse-control, was constantly surprising, not least the time he fell off a tightrope and landed on his nuts.Tuesday’s show – spoiler alert – is a special birthday episode that will see Ed Sheeran bestowed with a gold Blue Peter badge, along with a reprise for Richard Bacon, who was fired in 1998 after admitting he had used cocaine. Incidentally, I tried to interview Bacon for this piece, but he was busy attending Princess Eugenie’s wedding.And while we’re at it: Sheeran, yes, he can have that gold badge, awarded for extraordinary courage or expertise, but did you know the Queen also has one? And what is she really expert at, besides being a queen? Blue Peter never got the memo about the end of the age of deference: it still approaches the royals – along with any institution, from the Scouts to the navy to the National Trust – with a ponderous humility that must be a little confusing to a modern child.But it was never invented to keep up with the times. It was a place where people did things that weren’t allowed. They took foolhardy risks, cut things up, made a mess, fell over. Its quest is timeless."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/97e2e082b0a65d9a65606d8cbc0991c5439dd9f0/369_0_3259_1955/master/3259.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b831c8761deb7d864115ef0639c6dfe6","title":"german ruling parties angela mekel ride out bavaria election humiliation","story":"No resignations despite disastrous result for two of Merkel’s coalition partnersAngela Merkel has admitted her government shares responsibility for Sunday’s disastrous regional election result in Bavaria, blaming it partly on an erosion of confidence in politics on a national level.“A lot of trust has been lost,” the German chancellor said at a business conference on Monday, a day after her Bavarian allies in the Christian Social Union (CSU) were handed their worst result since 1954 in the prosperous southern state.She said the result had shown that even a thriving economy and high employment were not enough to win over voters. As a consequence, her biggest takeaway from Sunday’s trouncing was that she “must better ensure that this trust is there and also make the results of our work visible,” she said.Germany’s ruling parties were trying and ride out the fallout from the vote on Monday, despite calls for members of Angela Merkel’s government to resign over the debacle.The humiliating result for Merkel’s two partners is a serious blow for her shaky coalition, yet by Monday morning no heads had rolled despite calls from within the CSU for the party’s leader, Horst Seehofer, to resign.“I’m also not going to discuss my position today,” said a defiant Seehofer, speaking after a meeting of the CSU leadership which unanimously backed the Bavarian premier, Markus Söder, to continue in his position.Seehofer has been roundly blamed in the party for the result, which has been seen as punishment for sowing ision within the coalition over migration policy.“A leadership debate cannot be avoided,” Peter Ramsauer, a former CSU deputy leader, told German media on Monday. He said the CSU had received a “disastrous result” that “shouldn’t be relativised”.Calls for resignations also came from within Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union (CDU). “It probably can’t work without personnel consequences,” the CDU premier of Schleswig-Holstein, Daniel Günther, told Die Welt. “However, I don’t think much of making iniduals responsible. The entire CSU leadership has made mistakes in the past years … no one can be excluded.”Speaking after exit polls on Sunday night, Söder called it a “difficult day” for the CSU but said his party had a clear mandate to form a government. He is now expected to hurriedly form a coalition to govern the state with the centre-right Free Voters, excluding the Greens despite their record-high showing.All eyes will now turn to another regional vote, in Hesse at the end of the month, where both the CDU and SPD are languishing in the polls. The coalition partners will hope they can delay the final reckoning for the Bavarian disaster until then, giving them just under a fortnight to turn their fortunes around."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13b0aff5252c94bb170a319cf80f812e162964e4/0_273_4096_2459/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53cf018f9af26a524bb78f5ac4a35c1f","title":"invest in farming to stop youth migrating to cities urges un","story":"Strengthening rural economy in developing nations should be priority for those concerned with international migration, report saysStrengthening the development of the rural economy in developing countries should be a priority for those concerned with international migration, a new UN report says.Agriculture, the main focus of rural development, receives inadequate resources and attention, the report says. Modernising agriculture in poor areas could yield substantial benefits, it says, raising productivity and providing the pull needed to keep young people on the land instead of migrating to large cities.The report says jobs in what it calls “agricultural value chains” can provide opportunities for rural people close to where they already live, which is attractive to many who do not want to have to move.But while international aid donors often target development in poor countries as a way of stemming migration, some forms of development can lead to more international migration, as people get enough money to cover their migration costs but not enough to encourage them to stay. In contrast, improving agriculture and the infrastructure and services – health, education and social – in rural areas can reduce migration to cities.The State of Food and Agriculture 2018 report, from the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), focuses on migration, agriculture and rural development. Its authors found that while migration fuels economic growth in many cases, it can also have negative impacts and sometimes is a symptom of failures to invest in and foster agricultural and food resources.“Rural migration is closely linked not only with agriculture and rural development, but also with the overall development of societies,” said José Graziano da Silva, director general of the FAO, in a foreword to the report.“It has accompanied the gradual process whereby labour is transferred from agriculture to more productive sectors in manufacturing and services that are often located in urban areas, thus contributing to rising incomes and economic, social and human development.“In many high-income countries this process has reached the point where agriculture and rural areas are economically viable only to the extent that immigrant labour is available.”People who have already moved within their own country are much more likely to become international migrants, according to the report’s data.Farming can be perilous in developing countries, subject to shocks and crises from natural disasters or manmade problems. Too little is being done to shield families from these shocks and enable them to survive through lean times, the report says.In addition, rural areas host large numbers of displaced populations during protracted crises, which according to the report leads to “further challenges and potentially negative effects”.But there are ways to alleviate such burdens through policies focusing on providing economic opportunities for displaced migrants and encouraging their social integration.The report stresses that policies should not attempt to stem migration but to maximise its potential and minimise the negative effects, with the objective of making it a choice rather than a necessity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe2dd10f0058af3d990f75991f6b712cb1680bd/1926_480_1475_885/master/1475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=89400eb4c9eabc9a2258d715a2b041f0","title":"vincent kompanys father elected as first black mayor in belgium","story":"Footballer describes the election of his father, who came to Belgium as a refugee from the DRC, as historic The father of Vincent Kompany, the captain of Manchester City and a star of the Belgian national football team, has been elected as Belgium’s first black mayor, in what has been described as a “historic” moment for the country.The election of Pierre Kompany, 71, a mechanical engineer born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, as the country’s first sub-Saharan-born bourgmestre was celebrated by his son in a video message in which he spoke three languages.Kompany fils, 32, who was born in the Brussels suburb of Uccle, and his younger brother, François, who is also a professional footballer in the Belgian leagues, spoke of their pride in French, Dutch and English in the clip. “Just for the guys abroad: he is the first black mayor in Brussels,” he said. “It has never happened before. It’s historic. We are all happy. Congratulations to my dad.”The footballer added in a short written statement: “History! We are so proud of you dad. Come from DR Congo as a refugee in 1975. Now you have won the trust of your commune by becoming the first black mayor elected in Belgium! It was long but it is progress. Congratulations!”Racism in Belgium has been the subject of debate in recent months. The newspaper Le Soir used its entire front page last month to call for an end to bigotry after the country’s only black presenter on francophone television, Cécile Djunga, gave an emotional account of her first year as the main weather presenter on the public service broadcaster RTBF.“If you want a good laugh, I’ve got a good one for you today,” she had told her followers in a Facebook post viewed over 2m times, before recounting the tale of a woman who had called in days earlier to complain that the presenter was “too black and all people could see were my clothes”.He said: “We worked hard during this campaign, but I did not think it would be enough to become mayor. We have addressed people from all races and communities. That is why our score is so high.”Kompany, who is already a local councillor and an MP in the Brussels parliament, added that he wanted an “intergenerational community in which young people and the elderly go hand in hand with each other”.“This mayoralty is proof that people appreciate what I do,” he added.Philippe Lamberts, the Belgian MEP who leads the Greens in the European parliament said he believed the election was a sign that his country was changing.“It is symbolically important because it is a fact that Belgium has not done a very good job in integrating people of different origins. It is quite obvious when you look at the UK in comparison.“But I would also say that the fact that the two leaders of the greens in Brussels are women of Turkish and Moroccan origin is a sign that things are changing.”In an interview in 2014, Vincent Kompany had spoken of being the target of racist abuse when he first started in the game. “Our team had lads with African, Turkish and Italian origins,” he said. “Whenever we played matches outside Brussels we got dog’s abuse from our opponents’ parents.“Boys of 11 or 12 were being called ‘dirty niggers’. They also claimed the African lads were older than the ages in their passports, while the referees did nothing. Racism and inequality make me rebel.”The footballer, who speaks five languages, also told of other difficulties in his childhood. “My parents split up when I was 14,” he said. “I couldn’t understand why and it hurt. Luckily, I knew other kids with orced parents, so I didn’t feel alone and I took refuge in football. My father lost his job, I was thrown out of school and had to repeat a year and lost my place in the Belgium youth team.”His father, who was standing on a non-partisan “pro-Ganshoren” ticket, was taking part in local elections in which the main winners were the Greens and the far left and the far right. The Mouvement Réformateur, a party of centre-right liberals of which the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, is a member, appeared to be a main loser in Brussels ahead of the national elections next May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317534a7154f368e76fc8ba281a8cdcc577607/0_258_7693_4616/master/7693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8afca7a081434f71a1b0b65888926564","title":"the sand diggers of mali in pictures","story":"A building boom in the capital, Bamako, has sparked a surge in demand for bricks made from high-quality sand dug by hand from the bed of the Niger River.

Don’t you just love them? Barely a week goes past without some people losing the run of themselves at the sight of the next big thing that promises to make them thinner or more beautiful or happier. But how does a food turn into a fad? And is there any merit in any of them? Pricewatch went in search of some answers.They look like doughnuts and flake like croissants and for a brief spell five years ago the world – or at least that part of the world that was wealthy enough to care about such things – went nuts for cronuts. New York city pastry chef Dominique Ansel was the man who invented the tasty morsel and, within days of him rolling it out in his Big Apple bakery in May 2013, hundreds of people were queuing outside the bakery (proving we are not the only ones who should hang our heads in shame when it comes to mindless queuing). Within two months they were here – thanks to the Marker Hotel’s excellent executive chef Gareth Mullins. They can still be bought here – and they are as nice as they were at the outset – but the world quickly moved on and you could probably get through a whole year without hearing the word cronut mentioned once, except for now obviously.“When you mix high-quality coffee beans with the right fats, you get an amazing drink that stomps on hunger and cravings, banishes brain fog and helps you lose weight, build muscle, and increase focus and performance,” so said Dave Asprey, the man who decided putting coffee and butter together was a good idea. As his notion of adding butter to coffee gained traction, he told the world that he ate 4,500 calories a day and had not exercised in more than two years but still his “world-class anti-ageing physician” put him in “the lowest percentile” for all manner of illnesses. Medics were sceptical of his claims and so was Pricewatch having tried it on more than one occasion and not turned into svelte Adonis. While the butter coffee hasn’t gone away, like the cronut it has stopped making headlines.Have you ever wondered how kale got cool? How was it that something that was a cheap staple of Irish mammies for hundreds of years suddenly started appearing on menus in exotic locations all over the world with a sometimes ludicrous price attached to it? Well, according to a story we have seen reproduced multiple times, it wasn’t an accident. The American Kale Association (yes, that IS a thing) was sought out by super-cool New York PR woman Oberon Sinclair who worked her magic on its product and suddenly kale was the next big thing.\u0026nbspIt first appeared on the menu of New York’s hip restaurant The Fat Radish – which happened to be a Sinclair client too – in 2010. Then Beyonce wore the word on a T-shirt and Gwyneth Paltrow made kale crisps on the Ellen de Generes Show. By 2012 Time Magazine was declaring kale one of the top food trends of the year. Today no self-respecting hipster cafe will countenance a menu without at least some kale on it.There was time – and it wasn’t that long ago – when you couldn’t swing a cat without hitting a cupcake. They were on every street corner and at every wedding, going away do and birthday party in this part of the world. Sex and the City is to blame. In an episode broadcast on May 10th, 1998, Carrie and Miranda spent just over a minute sitting outside the Magnolia Bakery on Bleecker Street eating vanilla cupcakes. They spent that minute talking – on the off chance that you can’t remember – about Carrie’s crush on Aidan and Miranda’s thing with Steve. But the watching world cared less about what was coming out of their mouths and a whole lot more about what was going into them.Within hours of the broadcast, people were queuing up to be like Carrie (and to a lesser degree Miranda) and apparently happy to spend $4 on a single cupcake. Quickly the cupcake craze spread across the world and we were all at it. But not any more. There are no queues outside cupcake shops today and people no longer bring cupcakes to work to lift colleagues’ spirits.Instead people bring doughnuts. There are dozens of doughnut shops across the State, and Portland and Instagram are to blame. The Hipster capital of the US is where the trend for the tarted-up doughnut first emerged seven years ago and Instagram is the social media platform that made Homer Simpson’s favourite treats cool because, it turns out, the sugary greasy lumps are actually very photogenic. In fact, there are now over 10 million separate photographs of doughnuts on the social media platform. It’s hard to imagine what the puritanical Dutch who first introduced the doughnut to New Amsterdam – as it was then known – under the less than appetising name olykoeks (or oily cakes) would make of it all.If you have ever asked yourself why we can’t have nice things you need look no further than the breakfast roll. In the late 1990s we got a lovely thing – freshly baked French baguettes – and we almost instantly stuffed it with rashers, sausages, eggs, hash browns, butter and ketchup turning it into a waist-widening heart attack to go. There was a time – a time before the economic unpleasantness of a decade ago – when queues formed outside of convenience stores and petrol station forecourts every morning. The queues were made up of builders and hungover students and office workers looking to get some stodgy artery-clogging grease into themselves as fast as possible. There were even number one songs written about it while celebrated economists created characters based around the breakfast roll.To find out where it came from we looked through The  archive. The phenomena first appeared in print in this paper in a piece about female drunkenness in 2000. A decade ago, sociologist Dr Perry Share, of Sligo Institute of Technology, published a study of the jumbo breakfast roll in which he said it was “perhaps the ultimate symbol of our contemporary Celtic Tigerland”. He traced the breakfast roll back to Victorian England when roadside vendors would sell soft rolls containing ham, sausage or egg to the workers heading to the factories. It took off in Ireland when Cuisine de France and fancier fuel forecourts became a thing.In 2015 sales of courgettes soared as people tried out their new spiralising machines and retailers raced to cash in on a new fad. Courgetti became a thing and influential food writers, including well-regarded millennial bloggers Hemsley \u0026amp Hemsley, told us we could eat long thin strings of courgette with Bolognese or pesto instead of pasta. Suddenly spiralising machines were everywhere as frantic people looked to get in on a trend. We can’t be certain but the number of spiralising machines now gathering dust in kitchen cabinets across Ireland must be in the hundreds of thousands.The first mention of spiralising in this paper was a mere four years ago in a piece written by Róisín Ingle. “Life is just better when you can, at a whim, whip out a courgette and turn it into stunning looking spirals of green goodness that look not unlike spaghetti. And then you start calling it courghetti and you aren’t even embarrassed,” she wrote. We checked in with her last week see if she was still spiralising. “No,” she admitted. “I did for a while and I loved it, I really did but I don’t even know where it is any more. I think I might have broken it.” She is not alone.For thousands of years – going all the way back to the Incas – the people of Peru, Chile and Bolivia happily grew and ate quinoa and they had plenty of it to go around. It started being exported to the US only in the 1980s. Fast forward 20 years to when it was discovered by foodies who decreed the ancient seed to be a better option than wheat, couscous or rice. Suddenly the newly classified superfood (a ridiculous word if ever there was one) was everywhere.It is probably more healthy than many other options and it tastes grand but the heightened global demand has put pressure on many South American farmers to keep up with demand.In 2010 few people in Ireland – save for those who have spent time in the barbecuing parts of the US – had even heard of pulled pork but within five years it was virtually everywhere. High-end restaurants and low-rent delis were all selling versions of the slow cooked mushy pork mess. It actually comes from a western part of North Carolina and is typically made using the shoulder of a pig cooked slowly over barbecue coals until it is soft enough to be “pulled” into shreds and doused in barbecue sauce. That is not how most Irish food outlets prepared pulled pork which made its very existence here questionable. While you might still be able to get a pulled pork sandwich in some places in Ireland today it is nowhere near as faddy as it was even two years ago.A decade ago getting a burrito in Dublin would have proved beyond most people. There was a place in the Epicurean Food Hall which has since – sadly – become a Dealz and that was mostly it. Today there are more than 30 such burrito bars across the city and the size of the queues outside any one of the many Boojum’s that have opened in recent years suggest there is a whole lot of life in the fad yet. It is not hard to see the appeal. The food is lovely, moderately healthy and reasonably priced and it is a decent alternative to more traditional fast food options. The little donkeys can be messy to eat mind you.If you tried to open a hipster restaurant without putting this on your menu you’d be laughed out of it. And heaven forbid you’d call your avocado anything other than smashed. “Mashed avocado? Yuk . . . Smashed avo? Amazing.” The brunch favourite was invented in Australia and started to get cool in the 1990s when Sydney chef and restaurateur and brunch king pin Bill Granger added lime, salt and chilli flakes to the mix. The notion then travelled to the US and there was no holding it back once Instagram came along in 2010.Gwyneth Paltrow helped to popularise it in her cookbook It’s All Good. Typically avocado on toast costs around a tenner in an Irish restaurant today but you can buy an avocado – sorry, an avo – in a supermarket for not much more than a euro while the lime juice, chilli, salt and bread will cost around the same again. Money for jam, it is.They just keep rearing their ugly, pointless and utterly useless heads. All detox diets are nonsense. Foods do not help you detox. Your organs do. If you ever see anything that promises to detoxify you simple walk away you will be doing yourself a favour.By accident, Pricewatch found itself in a super cool new restaurant in Dublin last week that ticked all the hipster boxes – there was smashed avo, overnight oats, spiralised things, kale, cauliflower and all the rest. But our eye was caught by one thing in particular. Charcoal lemonade. Is that a thing now, we wondered. Turns out it is.It is a brand new – to us – fad and the charcoal is said to brighten skin and teeth and cleanse organs. We spent €4 on a small cup of the stuff. It was black and lemony and perfectly pleasant. But did we feel cleansed or bright? No, no we did not."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"\u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot say anything.

Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

File photograph: Dave MeehanPresident Michael D Higgins’s campaign has asked opponent Seán Gallagher not to send letters regarding the election to Áras an Uachtaráin, “for obvious reasons”.The formal request was dispatched after Mr Gallagher sent a letter to the President on Sunday night outlining his disappointment in his conduct during the build-up this month’s election.In particular he criticised President Higgins for declining to participate in a live debate on Monday night.“I note there are no public engagements in your diary for Monday that preclude you from participating in the Claire Byrne Live debate and your decision, as stated by you, is a political one in the context of this campaign,” Mr Gallagher wrote in a letter that was shared on social media.“I am disappointed by your decision and believe it is insulting to the people of Ireland and shows contempt for the integrity of our electoral process.“In the event you reflect on your position, I have left a space in my schedule to participate in the Claire Byrne Live debate.”Mr Gallagher had also ruled himself out of the debate on the grounds of not participating unless all candidates did so.In a formal, written response on Monday afternoon, the President’s campaign director Claire Power took issue with Mr Gallagher’s correspondence which they received “late on Sunday night”.“May I request that any further correspondence in relation to any aspect of the election campaign is directed to the Michael D Higgins Campaign Office, not Áras an Uachtaráin, for obvious reasons,” Ms Power wrote.“Let me confirm that President Michael D Higgins will fulfil the debate engagements that he announced publicly on October 2nd.“Can I say that I was surprised to receive your missive last night before the airing of one particular debate. As noted above President Higgins publicly indicated his commitment to debates 12 days ago.”Earlier, a spokesman for the campaign said the President had tried to strike a balance between his official commitments and media appearances.To date, the spokesman said, he had done about a dozen media interviews and one radio debate, with two further television debates to come.Mr Gallagher had said he would still participate in the first television debate of the campaign if President Michael D Higgins would join him.An invitation to all six candidates to participate in the programme remains open right up to live transmission, but only four have accepted: Joan Freeman Liadh Ní Riada Gavin Duffy and Peter Casey.Earlier, speaking on RTÉ’s Morning Ireland, Mr Duffy defended fox hunting, but said he would not have a problem with banning it if a more humane approach to controlling the fox population could be found.He said he was concerned about the over-poisoning of the countryside.Mr Duffy said the reason he was being asked about hunting was because he had defended the Co Meath Ward Union stag hunt, but said that no one raised the issue with President Higgins, even though he was the person who had issued the licence to them (when he was minister for arts, culture and the gaeltacht in 1997.)If the majority of people want hunting banned, the Government would have to move legislation, Mr Duffy said. “If someone has a more humane approach, I have no difficulty with that,” he said.When asked who was his favourite poet, Mr Duffy said it was Emily Dickinson. When asked who his favourite Irish poet was, he said Seamus Heaney. He described the line of questioning as strange.“Why is there the presumption that because I am a businessman that I am a philistine?” he asked.“I am a great supporter of the arts. I love the opera.“Don’t just judge me because I am a business person. I am a parent who wants to create a better society for my children.”Business people should not be dismissed, he said, as our social services system is funded by taxes.He said he wants a society that is open, inclusive, just, fair and compassionate.Mr Duffy acknowledged that the President has no executive powers, but could set the mood and adapt, “to change the conversation”.He said that “daylight robbery” is happening in the corporate world with multinationals manufacturing in the poorest parts of the world selling their products in the richest part and then paying their taxes in the “most accommodating” part.“We are going to have to have a conversation about funding models,” he said.Read more news, analysis and comment from the race to the \u0026Aacuteras"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3664181.1539622236!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ryanair apologises to staff after claims of sleeping in crew room","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPortuguese union official Fernando Gantra said the airline’s European operations in Dublin were contacted late on Saturday night about arranging accommodation for the crews. Ryanair has apologised to staff after claims they were forced to sleep overnight in a crew room after being stranded at Malaga Airport. Four Ryanair crews, 24 people in total, spent the night in the room as it was the only one available because of storms in Portugal. A photograph purporting to show six airline staff sleeping on the floor of the crew room was posted on the Facebook page Ryanair Must Change. The incident occurred on Saturday as Storm Leslie hit Portugal meaning that many flights had to be erted to Spain. A statement from Ryanair indicated that this picture is “clearly staged” and no crew slept on the floor. “Due to storms in Porto (13 Oct) a number of flights erted to Malaga and as this was a Spanish national holiday, hotels were fully booked. The crew spent a short period of time in the crew room before being moved to a VIP lounge, and returned to Porto the next day (none of the crew operated flights).”However, Portuguese union official Fernando Gandra – who is a former cabin crew member with Ryanair – said the airline’s European operations in Dublin were contacted late on Saturday night about arranging accommodation for the crews.Mr Gandra said the photograph illustrates the conditions provided by Ryanair for crews’ rest on Saturday nightSunday morning. He said the allegation that the photograph was staged was “completely irrevelant”. “I’m not going to comment on whether it was staged or not. Only the people who were there can make that statement,” he said. He added that what is relevant is the fact that 24 Ryanair crew had only eight chairs between them to sleep on Saturday night. “The only place they had available was the floor . . . The point is that Ryanair did not give their crews any place to rest.” He added that 800 Ryanair passengers also spent the night in the terminal with nowhere to sleep or eat. He also stated that all the other airlines affected by the storm in Portugal treated their passengers and crew properly. “Ryanair is the exception, not the rule,” he said.The photograph was shared on Twitter by former Ryanair pilot Jim Atkinson who tweeted: “This is a Ryanair 737 crew based in Portugal, stranded in Malaga, Spain a couple of nights ago due to storms. They are sleeping on the floor of the Ryanair crew room. RYR is earning €1.25 billion this year but will not put stranded crews in a hotel for the night. @peterbellew?” Peter Bellew is Ryanair’s chief operations officer. He responded: “Unfortunately all hotels were completely booked out in Malaga. The storm created huge damage in Portugal. Later after this the crew moved to VIP lounge. Apologies to the crew we could not find accommodation.”Mr Atkinson then posted a couple of incredulous messages from Ryanair staff on a pilots’ WhatsApp group. “Off season? No hotels?!?! There are thousands of hotels along the gold cost (sic). All hotels sold out that probably cost less than 35 euro a night and gave a discount for taking the no breakfast tariff!” Mr Atkinson said the experience of the Ryanair staff at Malaga Airport is a scenario “which is all too familiar for me having flown for Ryanair. Their mistreatment of staff is legendary, and being forced to recognise unions in the past year has only embittered Ryanair (Michael O’Leary) further”. Mr Atkinson worked as a Ryanair pilot from 2006 to 2014. He has been a stern critic of the airline. He said the staff shortages last summer which caused thousands of flights to be grounded were the result of pilots leaving because of working conditions. The claim has been denied by Ryanair. The duty manager at Lesma, Ryanair’s groundhandlers at Malaga, who was tasked with finding alternative accommodation told the Ryanair crews there was nothing available. Mr Gantra said: “It is not known if he had the authority to pay for these rooms on Rynair’s account andor if he was under budget restrictions which would impede locating rooms.” He said all the crews were flown back the following morning to Porto. When they asked the European operations headquarters in Dublin if they could have soft drinks and sandwiches courtesy of the airline, they were told that they could not. A spokesman for Forsa, which represents Irish pilots, said the photograph raised “very serious” issues about the treatment of Ryanair staff. He added: “It’s clearly unacceptable that flight crew aren’t properly accommodated in circumstances like these. Every member of the crew plays an important role in flight safety. In this instance, the facilities were inadequate to say the least. It’s undignified for the crew and compromises their health, safety and wellbeing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3661517.1539356993!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit explained why does the border matter and what is the backstop","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t A defaced ‘Welcome to Northern Ireland’ sign is displayed on the Border in Derry. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGettyThe 499-kilometre border running from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle will become the only land border between the UK and the European Union after Brexit. The 1998 Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) brought peace to Northern Ireland and removed the need for checks along the Border. It also established North-South regulations and institutions that helped support the peace process. The Border is currently invisible and neither side wants the return of infrastructure or the creation of a hard border.It is a frontier monitored and protected by customs officials, border inspectors, police or military. The fear is that the return of customs officials or border inspectors would be so unacceptable to people who travel freely across an open border that it would lead to anger and, potentially, violence. That could in turn lead to a police or military presence along the Border to protect check points. Customs and security posts along the Border were regular targets of republican paramilitaries during the 30-year Troubles.Different customs rules, regulations and standards will apply in Northern Ireland and the Republic if the UK is leaving the EU so the different rules could have to be enforced at a border.Neither party to the negotiations to both the withdrawal agreement and any future trade agreement post-Brexit wants to see the return of a hard border but they cannot agree a plan on how to achieve this.The EU and UK agreed in a political deal in December 2017 that a “backstop” was required in the withdrawal agreement that would guarantee an invisible border in the event of no other solution to achieve this being found in a Brexit deal, either in a specific solution for Northern Ireland or in a broader EU-UK trade deal. In March 2018 the two sides agreed that there had to be a legal text - not just a political declaration - around how this option would work in practice should no better option be found.It is an insurance policy written into the withdrawal agreement, or Brexit treaty, guaranteeing no harder border on the island of Ireland. It would only be used as a last resort or the default option if the EU and UK could not reach an overarching free trade deal that would make trade so frictionless that there would be no border between the EU and the UK, including on the frontier between Northern Ireland and the Republic.Brussels believes a hard border can be avoided and the Belfast Agreement upheld if Northern Ireland remains fully aligned with the EU’s customs union and parts of the single market after Brexit. This would mean matching the rules north and south of the Border for customs, energy, environmental regulations and laws covering agriculture and fisheries. Northern Ireland would also stick to EU rules covering state aid and would fall under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in applying those rules.It has not offered one yet. It does not want a hard border but has not said how it would achieve this by way of a backstop while still proceeding with its plan to leave the EU single market and customs union.No. Theresa May has said that no British prime minister could agree to different rules applying to different parts of the UK that would separate Northern Ireland constitutionally and economically from the rest of the UK.Yes, the Democratic Unionist Party, the largest part in Northern Ireland whose 10 MPs at Westminster prop up May’s minority Conservative government, and hardline Brexit supporters within her party. Both have said that Northern Ireland cannot be treated any differently from the rest of the UK after it leaves the EU in March 2019 and is opposed to any checks between Ireland and Britain and what they see as a border in the Irish Sea.It remains to be seen. In early October 2018, the British government appeared to float the idea of maintaining alignment for the whole of the UK with EU customs rules and that Northern Ireland would specifically remain aligned with EU rules on goods for a period beyond the transition period to December 2020 when current rules continue to apply. Both options would, May says, avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. The DUP, however, has repeated its insistence that there should be no checks between Ireland and Britain, which this option would inevitably entail. The party’s leader Arlene Foster has warned that its “red line” - that there could be no Brexit deal that would ide Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom - was “blood red”. The EU has said that the Chequers plan is unworkable as its own negotiators try to “de-dramatise” its own backstop to make it more politically acceptable to the UK government and the DUP.The UK government does not like the idea of a permanent backstop that would keep Northern Ireland tied to the EU customs union and parts of the single market indefinitely, preferring a time-limited backstop instead. This is because of Conservative fears that it could result in the UK overall being tied to the backstop indefinitely and hamper the UK’s future plans to agree trade deals with other countries. The EU believes that any backstop for Northern Ireland should be permanent. This was why both sides failed to agree a deal in crunch negotiations over the weekend ahead of the October summit of EU leaders. The EU said that it would be willing to consider a temporary backstop but that if no trade deal avoiding a hard border has been agreed by the time-limited backstop expires, then the Northern Ireland-only backstop would kick in. The UK rejected this.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/13/TELEMMGLPICT000177610545_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq8W44mZEW0zcVUHYed3romhKi2sT3vi7ux2-RDZwC4QA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"inside school promises better future girls escaping boko harams","story":"Aisha Bukar, deputy head of the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, Nigeria  Had she not panicked at the final moment, Aisha Aminu\u0027s last act would have been to kill herself and as many others as possible.Kidnapped last year by Boko Haram, the 15-year-old was conscripted into its army of child suicide bombers, with orders to blow herself up in a busy marketplace. But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said. He asked if we could get his children into school, which we did, and now that he\u0027s been freed from prison, he\u0027s gone back to school too.The names of some interviewees have been changed.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityJeff Bezos\u0026#39 rocket company wants to send \u0026#39millions\u0026#39 to live in spaceComment: German car firms were meant to make sure we got a good Brexit deal.

He added: “Our goal is to achieve a comprehensive restructuring as efficiently as possible, working closely with our creditors and other debtholders, and be better positioned to execute on our strategy and key priorities.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.Other apps with messaging functionality, including Snapchat and Facebook-owned Instagram, already allow users to unsend\u0026nbspmessages on their platforms.A Facebook spokesperson was not immediately available for comment but the firm told TechCrunch that it is working on developing the feature.Facebook internally tests products and features before they ship to the public so we can ensure the quality of the experience, the spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was expected to make upwards of $20m.The film, which has been heavily touted as a possible Oscars contender, faced stiff competition from two films that debuted last weekend: Tom Hardy’s supervillain smash Venom and the Lady Gaga-starring A Star is Born. Both films managed to retain large audience numbers, taking $35.7m and\u0026nbsp$28m respectively.Venom has shrugged off widely negative reviews to take\u0026nbsp$142m over 10 days in the US, while A Star Is Born – a firm awards favourite – has taken\u0026nbsp$94m over the same duration of time. For a directorial debut with a budget of $40m, the latter film’s success has been lauded by analysts.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Best films on Netflix Show all 28Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Netflix\u0027s recommendation algorithm is pretty sophisticated these days, to the point where it can probably determine not only what you want to watch next, but what you\u0027ll eat for breakfast 13 years on Wednesday and the thread count of your sheets. 328 The Wolf of Wall Street(2011.

Dir. the Safdie brothers, stars Robert Pattinson, Jennifer Jason Leigh)A Star is Born likely stole audiences attention away from First Man thanks to its\u0026nbsphigher profile cast (Gaga and\u0026nbspBradley Cooper compared to Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy) and ever-so-slightly better word-of-mouth, landing an “A” Cinemascore. There was also Chazelle’s\u0026nbspcontroversial decision to omit showing the American flag being planted into the moon, which caused a backlash from certain commentators, including\u0026nbspRepublican senator Marco Rubio.\u0026nbspThe controversy began after Gosling said, during a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, that he believed the astronaut’s moonwalk “was widely regarded not as an American, but as a human achievement”.\u0026nbspThe truth behind First Man’s most talked about scene“He was reminding everyone that he was just the tip of the iceberg—and that’s not just to be humble, that’s also true,” he said.\u0026nbsp”So I don’t think that Neil viewed himself as an American hero. From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.”The statement has been widely discussed online, and\u0026nbspalthough the American flag does appear on the moon in the movie, the damage seems to have been done. A spokesperson for the studio behind the $70m-costing First Man, Universal, has\u0026nbspsaid the box office results are not disappointing and pointed out that well-reviewed awards films often have long legs in cinemas.\u0026nbsp“This weekend’s results are\u0026nbspjust a starting point,”\u0026nbspUniversal’s distribution president Jim Orr told Variety.\u0026nbsp”Quality adult dramas released in this time period produce very healthy multiples. This is very much a marathon, not a sprint.”\u0026nbspOther new releases over the weekend in the States include Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and Bad Times at the El Royale, which made $16.2m\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp$7.2m, respectively. Next weekend looks to be another bumper box office bonanza as Halloween opens\u0026nbspanalysts are expecting the horror to make as much as $60m.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Andrew Grice\u0026nbspasks whether the dominance of big tech is now imperilling our democratic system and considers what can be done about itClick to followThe IndependentAllegations of state-sponsored interference in foreign elections have changed the gameWhen Theresa May called a surprise election last year Labour rushed out a manifesto which proved remarkably popular. There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a “digital licence fee” funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces “greater hostility from\u0026nbspthe mainstream media than we’ve probably ever had before”, inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas – not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\u0026nbsp“public service journalism”, funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.But Corbyn’s proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum £500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined £61,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its £7m spending limit by channelling £675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.I’m leaving Facebook – and it’s not because of Cambridge AnalyticaIn the same month, the cross-party Digital,\u0026nbspCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a “clear legal liability” for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.For the past 36 years, I’ve had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media\u0026nbspthe last 20 of them while working for The Independent. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the “is there anything you’d like to say today, prime minister?” style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. “Maintain the mystique,” one veteran political editor told me.It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary – then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher – briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10 such briefings had to be attributed to “Whitehall sources”. The archaic system would eventually change, with The Independent among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always thereThe lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist’s job to find out what’s going on people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn’s team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think journalists have long memories and won’t believe them next time if they get caught.The inevitable “poacher versus gamekeeper” relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster – and it’s changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: “Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to… the Conservative Party as well!”What’s shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The iding line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations – which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year – decided to shout louder to grab people’s attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels – first Sky, then a BBC offering – meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 247 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters’ agenda.Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There’s no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union – and underreporting about the benefits of membership – played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum and in the result.By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, The Daily  was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs’ expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians – though it’s also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. The Sun’s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, “will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” The Sun claimed to have “won it” when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.Scarred by Kinnock’s treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: “I’m not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.” In Blair’s view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: “It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.”The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour – there would be a “rapid rebuttal” or even “pre-buttal” when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as “you’ll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this” they complained behind reporters’ backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.\u0026nbspThey doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.Blair’s “hug them close” strategy worked, at least in opposition. The Sun, the country’s biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair’s communications director, said “no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people”:\u0026nbspGordon Brown, the chancellor John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and Murdoch.Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair’s demise and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.As papers like The Sun tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the “feral beasts” of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out The Independent for criticism when his real target was the Daily Mail he was still too frightened of its power to say so.David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair’s trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.\u0026nbspCameron, who called Blair “the master”, faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day “grid” of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn’t work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.May’s disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time – refreshingly – it didn’t work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated “MSM” in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour’s machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about “digital democracy” during Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn’t imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the “fake news media” and journalists who are “the enemy of the people”.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known – no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted “dark” ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can’t cope!”The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever inventedThe tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local levePoliticians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband’s communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, Ctrl Alt Delete, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age “has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media”. He says: “The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.”What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system of\u0026nbspelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.Created with Sketch.11 useful Facebook features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Clean up your News FeedMost of us are Facebook friends with some people we don’t actually care about, and there are several ways to keep their updates off your News Feed.

They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority. But with growing evidence that our democracy is under threat, the task is urgent.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The worst thing we have to worry about is repetitive strain syndrome and drinking too much coffee. But there is a heroic hardcore who are willing to put themselves in the way of harm to tell the story.Writing about certain presidents and princes can be bad for your health. In Michael Scott Moore’s case, it was pirates. He was doing research into pirates, so like any decent reporter worth his salt he thought he should go and interview one. What happened next you can read about in his new book, The Desert and the Sea. The clue is in the subtitle: 977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast.What image springs to mind when you think of pirates? Johnny Depp? An eye-patch? A cutlass? For me, it’s more an adjective – “swashbuckling”. Criminals of the high seas, of course, but romantic daredevils, skilled swordsmen, daring nomadic outsiders, surely. Michael Scott Moore has finally put paid to any lingering remnants of the myth by way of being kidnapped by them and held hostage for nearly three years, driven to the brink of madness, malaria and suicide by “a stupid and self-aggrandising pirate society, a suicidal culture in which gunshots rang in the street and gunmen were winners”.UK investigates reports of looting of sunken WW2 shipsMoore was a surfer – and author of Sweetness and Blood, a history of American expansionism after the Second World War, seen through the turquoise lens of surfing –\u0026nbspwho naturally felt a certain rapport with the men who make their living off the sea. And he felt that piracy was not exactly unknown in American history. “North America,” Moore writes, “had evolved from an underdeveloped haven for pirates to an antipirate world power within three generations.”Hobyo (Courtesy of Michael Scott Moore)I saw him before he left for Somalia – hale and hearty – and I went to see him again recently, in a cafe in West Village, New York, several years later, after he got back, now 49, looking like a war veteran, wounded, skinnier, traumatised, but a survivor. Older and wiser. He had planned to write a book about Somali pirates that would be pure reportage, “but,” he says, “it became more personal from the moment I got kidnapped”.\u0026nbspWhen you’re held hostage your entire life up to that moment keeps replaying itself in your head. His father, Bert Moore, was an aerospace engineer and alcoholic who committed suicide when Michael was aged 12. His mother told him it was a heart attack. He only found out what really happened 30 years later when he asked for a copy of the death certificate that read: “Gunshot\u0026nbspto\u0026nbspleft chest”. He had been kicked out of the family home in the suburbs of Los Angeles by Mrs Moore. After a year of trying to get sober he shot himself. Mother and son went to live in Redondo Beach, where he started surfing.abc)When his first marriage fell apart, Mike left his old southern Californian life behind and set up in Berlin. Somehow he ended up writing about pirate activities for Spiegel Online International and attended the trial of 10 pirates in Hamburg, in 2011. It was the first trial of pirates on German soil for 400 years. They had been arrested after a gun battle with Dutch commandos while trying to hijack a German ship.“I was as full of pirate romance as the next American kid” says Moore. He knew that\u0026nbspPirates of the Caribbean was pure Hollywood. But still he wanted to find out what they were really like. Moore had been to the Horn of Africa before –\u0026nbspon a counter-piracy vessel, a Turkish warship.But in January 2012, supported by a couple of magazines and a grant from the Pulitzer Centre\u0026nbspon Crisis Reporting, he set off again, without a warship this time. To be on the safe side he had tried to get kidnap insurance and been turned down. But he wasn’t naive. He knew he was in “a country where no one could save me if things went wrong”. He had security. “Good security”, as he describes it. The problem was that at the crucial moment they “disappeared”. They sold him out. He was paying them well, but the pirates were paying them more. And they were part of the same clan. “That particular clan was supposed to be hosting and protecting me,” he says with an ironic grin.He interviewed a pirate called Mustaf in a flyblown restaurant in Hobyo where he had to pay $620 for lunch. He left a filmmaker colleague at the airport and was being driven back into town along “Pirate Road” when his car was stopped by a dozen men bristling with automatic weapons. He was beaten, his glasses were broken, and he was bundled into the pirate vehicle of choice, a Toyota Land Cruiser.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Israeli soldiers hurl tear gas grenades during clashes following Israeli order to shut down the al-Lubbanal-Sawiyeh school near the west bank city of Nablus, 15 October 2018.

A gunman opened fire at a video game tournament killing multiple people and then fatally shooting himself in a rampage that wounded several othersOne of the pirates had the cheek to say to him, as if it was all his fault, “You have made a mistake.”\u0026nbspIt is a phrase that haunts him even to this day. For a long while in captivity, he felt the pirates were right about that: “I was a tall, white man hoping to make friends with pirates. Crazy.”\u0026nbspBeing a writer meant that he was worth something. “I have seen you on the internet,” said one of his captors. “You are famous.”\u0026nbspHe denied it. Then they fished out a picture of him that had appeared in the New York Times. I had even contributed in a small way to adding to the price on his head by writing an enthusiastic review of his surfing book in that newspaper. The asking price was $20m. If only I’d slated his book it might have brought the price down by a few million. His friends soon learned he had been kidnapped but we were warned not to write anything. Every time his name was mentioned on the BBC his price went up again.He was regularly beaten, and threatened with torture, or being handed over to al-Shabaab, but one of the worst things about being held in captivity is not having anything to read. One of the highlights of his first few months was piecing together fragments of The Gulf News\u0026nbspwhich had been wrapping up samosas. Taken to a ship a mile offshore, the Naham 3 – a highjacked fishing vessel – he was given a Bible by one of his fellow hostages. A lapsed Catholic, he read it twice from cover to cover, having to squint all the while, but finding consolation in “the gritty survival ethic” of the Old Testament. He decided he was not so keen on crucifixion as such.There were a lot of guards on the ship, and a fair few sharks in the water too. And without glasses he could barely make out where he was going. But in the end he leapt off the ship in a bid for freedom. He didn’t make it and spent the next three\u0026nbspweeks chained up in solitary confinement. I read a story online about how he had been shot while trying to escape. This turned out to be a myth put about by the pirates themselves, with a notion of speeding up delivery of the ransom.Around this time Moore devoutly wished he had become an astronaut – or anything – rather than a writer. As a kid, his bedroom had been decorated with astronaut wallpaper, peppered with rockets and moons and stars. Now marooned on board a very terrestrial ship, he was tormented by dreams and rumours of a rescue that never came. But there was still one option available to him. He could try and shoot his way out. It would be the heroic thing to do. But it would also be stupid. The guards had a habit of leaving their Kalashnikovs lying about. There was zero chance of getting away but he could go out in a blaze of glory and bullets, and maybe take a pirate or two down with him. “I was angry enough to pick up a Kalashnikov,” he says.Rolly Tambara, who were held in captivity together (Seychelles Nation)The thing that stopped him was the memory of his father’s suicide. His logic was that he didn’t want his mother to have to bear witness to both the men in her life self-destructing. His mother becomes one of the heroes of the book. German in origin, Marlis was still playing tennis and golf, and was due to have lunch at a Mexican restaurant when five men in suits (unheard of in Redondo Beach) turned up at her door. Schooled by the FBI, she had to conduct ransom negotiations herself over the phone, driving the price down from $20m\u0026nbspto $8m, then down to $5m, and finally $1.5m. In the end she recruited a mercenary to deliver $700,000, which she\u0026nbspmanaged to cobble together from different sources, friends, family and Der Spiegel.“I’m still angry,” Michael says, “about losing more than two years of my life.” But he had to rein in his anger if he wanted to live. When he explained he needed a doctor for his broken wrist the trigger-happy guard said to him, “You mean it was broken in this operation.” He was tempted to reply, “No motherf***er, I’m in the habit of walking around Somalia with a broken wrist.” “Yes” is how he chooses – rather carefully – to phrase it.He developed friendships with the other hostages – Chinese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, Filipinos –and he came around to liking some of the guards. But he was never tempted by Stockholm syndrome: “I went through a long period of wanting to kill them.” Notably one guy by the name of Ali.Werne)Sometimes your reading can save your life. In Moore’s case it was Epictetus, the great stoic philosopher. Stoicism says that you can’t do a lot about your fate, but you can control your attitude towards it. Epictetus asks the question, what do you do if your servant drops your favourite vase and it smashes into a thousand pieces? Do you lash out and whip the servant, or do you say – which is what he recommends – “the vase has been restored”. Moore grits his teeth and develops a sense of humour about his predicament. “Not that I laughed every day.”\u0026nbspWhen he was staring down the barrel of a gun, quite literally, he learned to sit and accept the prospect of a sudden death. “I had to train my mind for actual non-existence.”As well as ancient Greek philosophers, a collection of Tom and Jerry cartoons definitely helps. As does news, on a short-wave radio, of the World Cup in Brazil in 2014, when Germany thrashed Brazil 7-1 in the semi-final.\u0026nbspThere is an ironic twist in Moore’s story, when most of the people who tormented him for so long are annihilated, in a way he could never have anticipated, but which reflects what he writes about the rise of “factionalism and violent opportunism”. One further irony:\u0026nbspwhen he gets free he even has one of his former captors becoming a Facebook “friend”.Disney removes bride auction scene on ‘Pirates of the Caribbean’ ride‘Porch pirates’ steal 4-year-old boy’s supply of life-saving medicineMaybe he could have made it as an astronaut, but he is the most persistent and unstoppable of writers. He simply stole a pen and paper from the pirates and wrote about his experiences, like a Solzhenitsyn of the Somali gulag. But these samizdats never see the light of day. When his guards read their own names they confiscate his notebooks, again and again. Finally he realises his only way out is fiction. He sets his novel in southern California, not in Somalia. About a quixotic innocent who is kidnapped by bad guys. It was partly allegory, to remind him of what happened, but now it’s in danger of becoming his next book.For Michael Scott Moore, writing is therapy, a way of retaining sanity. “To put painful events into a certain order, I had to find a way through it. The easiest thing was to set down what happened.”I asked him what he missed most during his 977 days. “I’m not sure there was any one thing. Beer? Fresh fruit? Above all my family and friends. Everything about my old life, good and bad,” he said. “I was just grateful to be alive in the end.”There is almost a note of sadness or nostalgia in his voice when he says that the traditional Somali pirate is now virtually extinct. “The business model has evolved. They’ve shifted into arms and human trafficking. Piracy has become too dangerous.”Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’, and\u0026nbspteaches at the University of Cambridge‘The Desert and the Sea:\u0026nbsp977 Days Captive on the Somali Pirate Coast’, by Michael Scott Moore, is published by Harper CollinsShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But now\u0026nbspOnePlus wants to be truly famousClick to followThe Independent TechCertain phrases tend to follow OnePlus around. Chief among them is that it’s “the best phone you’ve never heard of”, and it’s representative of the rest. Everyone who’s used a OnePlus phone loves it, but the trouble is that group is relatively small.Now the company is hoping that it can jump into the mainstream, taking on the more famous Android phones like Samsung’s flagships and finally putting those “iPhone killer” headlines to the test.It intends to do so in a variety of different ways. But the latest is a major announcement that it will finally be much easier to buy: it has signed new partnerships with the UK\u0027s biggest carriers and shops, so that people will be able to buy it if they\u0027re on EE or Vodafone, or pick one up at John Lewis.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

And it is all part of the company\u0027s plan to finally turn the huge amount of hype around its phones into a similarly huge number of sales.But the new carrier announcements are also actually an extension of the work the company has already done in building its brand and encouraging people to recommend its phones, the company says. And it is adamant it will not come at the cost of the things that have made the phones so beloved, such as the engagement with its community that decides everything including what the phones look like and what features are added to them.OnePlus 6T: Release date announced for super-charged AndroidWe’re a digital brand first, and that means word of mouth is very important – it’s the number one way new users hear about us, Carl Pei, co-founder and head of brand of OnePlus, tells The Independent\u0026nbspin an exclusive interview. You may think that this is counter-intuitive, but partners like EE and Vodafone are actually an extension of our online strategy.Our users advocate us to their friends and family, and having high-street visibility means that now people can try our device in-store. The brand endorsement and support that these prestigious carriers and retailers have given us can also be taken as a compliment.Pei\u0026nbspsays that the new shot at the mainstream won\u0027t change the way the products are designed and made. It will only expand the number of people who are able to contribute towards new ideas and feed back on old ones, he says, allowing OnePlus to keep that approach even while it expands the number of people who are a part of it.As we grow, we’ll get more feedback and pressure about our design choices –\u0026nbspwe only add features which can improve the experience, not because they’re in fashion, he says.\u0026nbspIt’s important to understand what people really need.The UK OnePlus forum\u0026nbspis already one of the most engaged of any country in the world, with 1.5 million active users. More than 1,000 Britons turned up to see the reveal of the\u0026nbspOnePlus\u0026nbsp6, its latest phone, and it would go on to sell more than a million of those devices.OnePlus 5 smartphone at a OnePlus pop-up store at the Bikini Berlin shopping mall on June 21, 2017 in Berlin, Germany (Sean GallupGetty Images)OnePlus has inspired fanatical devotion in its customers, who queue up for the phones and flock to the launch events. Some of that devotion was inspired precisely because the phones have been so complicated to buy: at the beginning, they could only be got through an invitation system that meant users felt they had been allowed access to club, and that exclusivity encouraged loyalty.But Pei\u0026nbspis clear that OnePlus doesn\u0027t intend to give up on that customer – or fan –\u0026nbsprelationship, even if there are many more customers that are a part of it.We’ve always been very focused on our users and we’ll have to work hard to ensure current users feel valued, and new users are welcomed. It’s easy for brands to forget where they’ve come from – we’ve learned a lot from others in the industry, both in success and failure, he says.We’re committed to keeping our core and staying grounded, while expanding our business. The ultimate driver of people wanting to support you is having a great product, and that’s followed by having great service. The product attracts you at first, but it’s long-term service which will keep you loyal. Too many businesses are focused on bringing in new users.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Users can go on holiday to France and still have full access to the\u0026nbspNetflix films and Spotify\u0026nbspmusic they get at home, for instance.But a tranche of newly-released official\u0026nbspdocuments about the anticipated impact of a no-deal Brexit includes a paper that suggests the portability\u0026nbsparrangement that exists with the bloc would “cease to apply”.Created with Sketch.

But when they do so they will most likely see the library of the country they are in, as happens if Britons travel outside of the European Union now.“UK Netflix subscribers are able to access Netflix everywhere in the world Netflix is available and will continue to do so once the UK leaves the EU,” a Netflix spokesperson said. The company said that “local catalogues vary due to licensing and local tastes”, but pointed out its original shows are available everywhere.The new papers also make clear that the same regulations would apply to geo-blocking regulation. That ensures that people can buy from online services across the continent, without being punished for doing so from another country.“Following repeal of the Geo-Blocking Regulation in the UK, traders from the UK, EU and third countries would not be prohibited from discriminating between EU customers and UK customers,” the papers say.“For instance a UK trader would be able to offer different terms to a UK customer compared to a French customer.”Companies based in the UK and selling products and services in the EU\u0026nbspwill still have to comply with the regulation, to ensure that they don’t discriminate between people in different countries within Europe.The new geo-blocking rules go into effect in December 2018, meaning that they will apply to UK citizens for about\u0026nbspthree months before a possible no-deal Brexit in March 2019.The paper covering ‘Geo-blocking of online content if there’s no Brexit deal’ and another covering portability of content\u0026nbspis one of a range of papers released in the latest set of documents from the UK government. They also include new documents showing Britain could no longer benefit from deals that represent a significant portion of UK trade and that train journeys into and out of the EU could be disrupted.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Europe correspondent Jon Stone explores\u0026nbspthe latest dip on\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspBrussels\u0026nbsproller coasterClick to followIndy PoliticsWith the European Council summit looming, the Irish border is still a sticking pointWhat just happened? All weekend, news trickling out of Brexit talks became more and more positive. By Sunday lunchtime EU diplomats were certain a deal had been agreed. Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, headed out to Brussels to confirm it all – or so we thought.Then the Brexit roller coaster hit yet another big dipper: after a shorter-than expected meeting between Raab and Michel Barnier, it was all off again, and we were, in the words of one official “back to square one”.Anyone following these talks will have become accustomed to twists and turns, but with this week’s European Council summit looming – the “moment of truth” –\u0026nbsp the stakes are higher than ever. The Irish border, and the so-called “backstop” is the sticking point.A deal of sorts appears to have been agreed: The Independent understands that an agreement at a technical level – between officials – was struck. But agreement at a political level is a different question entirely.\u0026nbspTalks are shrouded in secrecy, and leaks from them are prone to spin. But as far as we can tell EU appears to have agreed to the UK plan that would, with some caveats, keep the whole UK inside the customs union to prevent any borders around Northern Ireland – either between it and Great Britain, or it and Northern Ireland.This had been proposed by the UK to placate the DUP – who want no difference in treatment between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and who say they would sink any deal that did. Most people believe they’re single-minded enough to carry through on their threat.But sources say Brussels is sceptical that this plan would work – and so are insisting on what has been dubbed “the backstop to the backstop”. The thinking here goes that if the UK’s political instability means that if trade talks collapse and the UK has second thoughts about being tied to the EU customs union, the original EU plan to prevent a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland would step up.The prime minister is probably cursing herself for calling last year’s electionBut this was unacceptable to the British government, who don’t think they could get even this past the DUP.There is a fundamental tension for the UK government which restricts their freedom to compromise in talks: lean towards a customs union for the whole UK to placate the DUP, and Tory Eurosceptics get angry because they want to be outside the customs union. But lean too hard the other way, and make the backstop more specific to Northern Ireland, and the DUP withdraw their votes.With a razor-thin majority in the Commons the government can’t really afford to lose either. Ultimately it is now parliament, and what the government can get through, that is the biggest obstacle to signing a deal.\u0026nbspSo what happens next? There are no more talks between officials until the European Council summit later this week, where leaders will discuss their response. The negotiations teams – who both speak very highly of each other – clearly believe they have gone as far as they can within the instructions they have been given by their respectively political leaderships.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

Some speculate that Theresa May could simply wait: let the threat of a no deal loom ever larger and increase pressure on MPs to back the technical accord. Others fear that this is wishful thinking and that a no deal may now be more likely than not. \u0026nbspEither way, with the composition of the House of Commons the main obstacle to a deal, the prime minister is probably cursing herself for calling last year’s election, blowing her majority, and putting the DUP in the driving seat.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Bullying and harassment have no place in the House of Commons\u0026nbspand the Parliamentary Digital Service.\u0026nbspWe fully accept the need for change and, as a leadership team, are determined to learn lessons from the report. We apologise for past failings and are committed to changing our culture for the better.\u0026nbspAs Dame Laura recognises, this will not be achieved overnight. We have already begun the process.\u0026nbspThere was an additional meeting of the Commons Executive Board earlier today and the House of Commons Commission will meet on Monday 22 October specifically to consider the report’s findings and identify next steps.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWe are grateful to Dame Laura and to everyone who contributed to the Inquiry. This report will help ensure that positive change takes place.Valerie Vaz, shadow Commons leader, said some of the accounts in Dame Laura Cox report were truly shocking.\u0026nbspShe said: “Sexual harassment and bullying must not be tolerated in any workplace. Some of the accounts in this report are truly shocking.\u0026nbsp“The House of Commons has recently passed an independent complaints process to deal with cases of bullying, sexual harassment and victimisation under the supervision of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.\u0026nbspShe added: We will continue to work on a cross-party basis to tackle this and ensure new procedures are as robust and effective as possible in order to protect everyone working in and visiting the House of Commons.”An interesting development in the Commons - the government has pulled key business linked to a crackdown on knife and acid sales.Theresa May will speak to French president Emmanuel Macron on Monday evening ahead of the European Council meeting, Downing Street has confirmed.Mr Macron told a press conference in Paris that he would discuss Brexit with the Prime Minister ahead of Wednesday\u0027s two-day summit.Her official spokesman confirmed they were to speak by telephone, and said she had also recently spoken with German chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch premier Mark Rutte.He added: She has had, as she does ahead of any European Council summit, conversations with some European leaders in recent days and she will be having more in the days to come.Quite significant. The Tory MP, Dominic Grieve, has said he will only support the government in a vote if the option for a second referendum was included - considering how opposed the PM is to such a vote, we should now put Grieve in the certain-to-vote against box on the final deal.Jeremy Corbyn is guilty of a shameless U-turn and a betrayal of the British people who voted Leave, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has told the Commons.Referencing the Labour leader\u0027s call for the UK to stay in the customs union, Mr Johnson asked the Prime Minister to confirm the UK would take back control in December 2021.Theresa May confirmed that was her expectation, adding one of the issues still under discussion was how we can ensure we do reflect the temporary nature of the backstop, which she went on to add should not be necessary.Tory MP Anna Soubry says what we now see is complete chaos, and asks the PM to take Brexit back to the people to vote on in a fresh referendum.\u0026nbspMay says that Parliament gave people the decision to decide its future, and it\u0027s important for the faith in democracy, that the result is respected. The People\u0027s Vote happened in 2016, and it will be respected, the PM adds.Theresa May - responding to Corbyn - says we never hear from the Labour Party exactly what deal they want.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCorbyn says Britain deserves better than the blindfold Brexit the government is pursuing. Labour has set out our six tests, he adds.\u0026nbspWe want a deal that allows us to strengthen rights and standards... Labour will not give the government a blank cheque.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn responds by saying: This really is beginning to feel like Groundhog day - less than 6 months to go, and what have we got to show for it?\u0026nbspThe Chequers plan appears to be dead in the water - even her own conference speech couldn\u0027t mention it, he adds.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAs we reach a critical point in this nation\u0027s history - we need a PM that will for once make the right decision and put the country before her party ... for too long this country has been held hostage to those in her party who want to lower rights and standards...\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe PM says she wants to look the British people in the eye and tell them the backstop is only a temporary solution. She says it must be the case the backstop must not need to come into force, it should be temporary, and we must be able to make sure we cannot be kept in the backstop indefinitely.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMay says that she continues to believe a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and that it is in reach.Please allow a moment for our liveblog to loadThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But it might well be the only option which is not completely impossible at this stage.“It should be acceptable to the EU. It avoids the worst economic damage that Brexit will wreak. It resolves the Irish border issue. And it comes closest to reconciling the different views of Leavers and Remainers.”Brexit talks: What on earth just happened?May to make Brexit statement after Brussels talks hit impasse- liveShe accused the government of “threatening us with fire, to make us choose the frying pan”, and argued any deal Ms May presents will probably be vague about the future relationship with the EU and damaging to the UK’s interests.“For MPs to support a bad or blindfold Brexit – a cobbled together withdrawal agreement and a vague statement about our future relationship – would in my view be a real dereliction of duty,” Ms Sturgeon said.She added: “As the crucial vote looms closer, it is also time for inidual members of the House of Commons to consider what compromises they see as justified – and which are not – if they are to serve their constituents and the wider public interest.“If they do that, I believe that a common sense outcome could yet be found.”The first minister reiterated her support for a new Brexit referendum if a sensible plan cannot be agreed, an option The Independent is backing through its Final Say campaign.Scotland voted by 62 to 38 per cent\u0026nbspin favour of remaining in the EU in 2016, and the SNP government has been vocal in its opposition to the prime minister’s exit strategy.The SNP has also argued Brexit strengthens the case for Scottish independence, heaping pressure on Conservatives north of the border.Ruth Davidson, the Scots Tory leader, hinted she would\u0026nbspresign if\u0026nbspNorthern Ireland\u0026nbspwas given special trading terms with the EU in a Brexit deal, against a background of the SNP arguing\u0026nbspfor Scotland to remain in the single market even if the rest of the UK leaves.Ms Davidson said\u0026nbspshe “could not support” such an agreement, in a joint letter to the prime minister\u0026nbspalso signed by\u0026nbspDavid Mundell, the Scottish secretary.Scottish Conservative constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said Ms Sturgeon’s speech was merely “drumming up the prospects for Scottish independence”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

While the AfD haven’t gone away, Sunday’s Bavarian elections show that the story is more complicated.The main way conservatives across Europe have reacted to the rise of right-wing populism has been to steal its clothes. If this is what voters want, then they can have it, the centre right has said. And they can get it from us.Britain is the best successful example of this strategy, where Theresa May’s Tories have eaten Ukip by embracing Brexit, lambasting “citizens of nowhere” and swelling their poll share to one they have not enjoyed for decades.Brexit talks: What on earth just happened?But Bavaria is now the best example of where this approach has gone wrong. For months before the election the CSU, the regional conservative allies of Angela Merkel who have dominated politics in the state since 1949, banged on about immigration. They faced down the chancellor and forced changes in refugee policy at a national level. The goal was to show voters there was no need to vote AfD if they wanted to be mean to foreigners.When polling day came on Sunday, the CSU lost a good chunk of voters to the AfD, as expected. But it lost more, according to a polling analysis by Der Spiegel, to the Greens – swathes of its one-time supporters apparently horrified at the party’s increasingly xenophobic tenor.The Greens have been unambiguously pro-refugee and are on the rise across Germany, especially so in Bavaria. They took second place and denied the CSU a majority for only the second time since 1949 – in elections fought under a proportional system.The environmentalists, who are less radical than their UK-based counterparts but nonetheless left of centre, are now flying high in the national polls, with an increasing number of surveys showing them taking second place.They have done this before, a few years ago, when a row over nuclear power was making headlines in Germany. Merkel neutered them simply by adopting their policies and pledging to close down nuclear plants. The pragmatic chancellor may have less room for manoeuvre this time, however – with pressures both to her left and right on immigration.AfD says Islam is not welcomeThere are other strands to the story, too. The social democrats, who are in coalition with Merkel’s conservatives at a federal level, lost voters to basically everyone, sinking for fourth place. Once a force to be reckoned with, they are now in serious need of a rethink and recovery if they are to even survive. They yet show little sign of having the energy to reinvent themselves.Their story is common across Europe, from France to the Netherlands from Greece to Italy where once-powerful centre-left social democratic parties are being eviscerated. Germany’s SPD has taken a particular beating from having twice now signed up to work with the conservatives, with little to show for it. When the government does things wrong they get blamed, when it does things right, they get little credit.Whether the Greens will stay on the up is not certain. German politics for the last decade has been a bit of a carousel, with minor parties getting some time in the sun between general elections as voters search around for an alternative before losing interest. The Greens, the Left, even the Pirate Party, have all at various points had temporary surges – but the only force that has sustained increased support so far has been the far right.But what does look certain is that Germany’s conservative establishment is not immune from the rot that has been afflicting its social democratic one. The centre right in European countries – who across the continent have weathered challenges to their dominance with far more resilience than their left-of-centre counterparts– will be watching with an interested fear.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

Brexit news: Half of cabinet in threat to quit over BrexitBut critics within Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos party say the conditions are too restrictive and were designed to ensure Mrs May could never satisfy them.Caroline Flint, a former Government minister, said she would vote for a reasonable deal because leaving without an agreement doesn\u0027t serve the country\u0027s interests of Labour\u0027s interests.She said: I believe if there is a reasonable deal that stops us crashing out with no deal, we shouldn\u0026rsquot rule it out.The problem is, we are now - those of us who want to get a deal - are sometimes stuck between a rock and a hard place between hardline Brexiteers who think we can waltz off without a deal and some hardline Remainers who, for their own reasons, don\u0027t want a deal because they want to overturn the referendum results.Caroline Flint would support Theresa May to avoid a no-deal Brexit (Image: )Theresa May is facing turmoil within her own party (Image: )Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell and Stoke-on-Trent North MP Ruth Smeeth also indicated they could support the Prime Minister.Around 15 Labour MPs are thought to have decided to back Mrs May while some estimate as many as 30 could do the same.But it is understood that Conservative whips and senior politicians have yet to extend a formal offer or ask for talks with Labour MPs to secure their support, indicating they are not yet relying on Labour votes to get the deal through Parliament.Downing Street has insisted the Prime Minister remains confident of getting a Brexit deal, despite the failure to bridge differences over the future of the Irish border ahead of this week\u0027s crunch summit.

I can say that no further negotiations are planned ahead of the European Council.The PM\u0027s official spokesman said that real progress had been made on a number of issues and the Government was determined to press on with talks.Brexit talks have ground to a halt (Image: )But he said that the EU continued to insist on the possibility of a carve-out for Northern Ireland which could see a customs border down the Irish Sea - something Mrs May has already said would be unacceptable to any British Prime Minister.Britain is offering a temporary backstop arrangement under which the whole UK would remain in the EU customs area unless an open border in Ireland was secured by a broader trade agreement.

The proceeds are collected by the UK taxman and sent to Brussels.Ending tariffs will reduce shop and pub prices, improve living standards and will help non-EU suppliers, currently discouraged by tariffs, quotas and the extensive paraphernalia of EU protectionism.Mr Martin said some iniduals, businesses and business organisations have mistakenly or misleadingly repeated the myth that food prices will rise without a Brexit deal.He added: In fact, the only way prices can rise post Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs.The EU will have no say in the matter, provided that the government does not sign away the UK\u0027s rights in a \u0027deal\u0027 in the meantime.

In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away.

Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace.”Cutting it will make holidays cheaper for families who have been hit by pricier trips because of the weaker Pound.On long haul flights, there is a £ tax on an economy ticket. This is a huge leap from  when it was just £.There is no environmental justication, it is simply used to fill the Treasury’s coffers. Slashing it will also boost businesses hoping to sell products outside of the EU. It will show Brexit Britain is an outward-looking, global nation.We hope you’re listening, Mr Hammond.“It would make saving for hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to.The Chancellor this March launched a review into APD in Northern Ireland as promised in the confidence and supply deal Theresa May struck with the DUP after last year’s Election disaster.Belfast Airport claims that nearly a million passengers have switched to Dublin in the past year, where the tax was axed in  by Ireland’s then transport minister, current Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Ms Patel and Mr Wilson said a cut would prove Northern Ireland was “open for business” as well as other regional UK airports.The total contribution from APD for the Treasury has ballooned from £ million in  to £. billion – a rise of  per cent.But campaigners claim there is little evidence the money is being used to tackle environmental issues.Frontier Economics last month claimed more than  new airline routes may be added at UK airportsthe Government abolished APD altogether.The think tank claimed an extra  routes would become viable, including eight new destinations from Aberdeen, nine from Belfast and seven from Southampton.James Roberts, political director of the Taxpayers Alliance, said: “Air Passenger Duty manages to fly under most people’s radar, but it has to be one of the most pointless taxes out there.“There’s no real environmental justication – it’s just a straight up levy on both family holidays and air trade links.”The summer holidays are a distant memory and families across the country will be starting to save up for next year’s trip. Yet a big chunk of that cost doesn’t pay for your holiday - it goes straight into the government’s coffers.Buying a ticket for a long-haul flight out of the UK will set you back at least £ in air passenger duty, a tax levied on all adult flyers from UK airports. So for a family of four flying in economy class, you’d have to fork out £, on top of whatever the airline is charging as their fare and airport charges.This is quite the increase from when two rates of either £ or £ was introduced in .Research released last year by A Fair Tax On Flying, which campaigns for a reduction in air passenger duty, shows that this tax makes up  per cent of the average cost of a European short-haul ticket.Looking around, you quickly realise our tax on flying is giving Brits a raw deal. The UK has the highest short and long-haul aviation tax anywhere in Europe. Countries nearby, like Ireland, have abolished their air taxes after seeing the bad effects it had for their economies. Northern Ireland gets hit particularly bad, as holidaymakers head to Dublin to dodge the unnecessary costs.Flying does have consequences, like emissions and noise for people who live right near airports, but the £. billion it raises pays for those many times over.Cutting air passenger duty is exactly the kind of policy that Brexit Britain should embrace. It would make saving for those hard-earned holidays easier, and it would also make the UK a more attractive place to come to. It would be a massive boon for Northern Ireland. Tourists and exporters would see that the country is open for business.Committing to cut air passenger duty in half would be a great message and save flyers millions. That’s why MPs from dferent parties are supporting this campaign from the TaxPayers’ Alliance and A Fair Tax On Flying. The Chancellor should commit to this in next week’s budget and make saving for holidays that bit easier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Treasury Minister Robert Jenrick has threatened to ban fundraising sites like JustGiving from slapping the five per cent fee on Gt Aid.Peter Lewis, head of the Institute of Fundraising said: “We welcome today’s announcement from JustGiving.“We are pleased to see JustGiving continuing to develop its model and responding proactively to enable donors’ money to go even further, especially at times of major incidents.JustGiving boss Jerry Needel said: “We are very proud to announce that from today, people using JustGiving can crowdfund for free.”He added: “Following feedback from our amazing community of fundraisers, we are also announcing that JustGiving will now be free to use following major incidents including acts of terrorism, catastrophes or natural disasters.“We know people want to help those affected as quickly as possible after these events and we want to do everything we can to support that.”“We are excited about the signicant changes we are making and look forward to continuing our work supporting thousands of charities and millions of iniduals raising funds for the causes that matter to them the most.”Labour MP Neil Coyle, who has lobbied the government to ban sites from charging fees on donations, demanded JustGiving pay back the half a million pounds it took from Grenfell and terror attack funds last year.He said: It is reassuring that no company will again profit when disasters or terrorists strike in our country.But JustGiving must acknowledge the damage theyve done by picking the pockets of all the people affected by Grenfell or last years terror atrocities. Its payback timethey want to rebuild trust completely.John Coventry from the GoFundMe site, which doesnt charge a penny for fundraising, said: The vast majority of campaigns on JustGiving are people raising money for charity, and the companys whopping % fees will still apply to all those running marathons and doing their sponsored walks.When it comes to gt aid - JustGiving will keep pocketing % of taxpayers cash under the cover of a consultation. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest.

Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide. Mrs May made a career out of being the strong and silent type.Many of her MPs worry she is actually weak, vacillating and inarticulate.We are becoming accustomed to ruthless “wet jobs” by authoritarian tyrannies such as Russia, North Korea and the People’s Republic of China, many of them “friends” of Jeremy Corbyn.But Saudi Arabia has always revelled in public and private bloodshed. When it comes to terrorism, all roads lead back to Riyadh.A respectable MP, who does not joke about such matters, tells me the Saudi Embassy in London once had a torture chamber in the basement.I wonderit still does Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We must secure a time-limit agreement for the temporary Customs Union — remaining in it by the next election would stop us from striking any meaningful trade deals outside the EU.Meanwhile, Tories threatening mutiny should consider what will happenthey try to oust the PM. It will spark a bloody leadership battle that will strengthen Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour.It could also lead to a General Election in which the Tories will likely be punished by an unforgiving public, irritated at being dragged to the polls yet again.This week the PM must present her solution to the Irish border and reiterate her commitment for a No Deal Brexit, in which our £billion cheque would be taken off the table.And the Tory party needs to stand firmly behind her — for now. Too much is at stakethey implode.BRITAIN has the steepest air tax in Europe.So it is right that politicians are calling on Philip Hammond to slash air passenger duty in the budget. Cutting it will make holidays cheaper for families who have been hit by pricier trips because of the weaker Pound.On long haul flights, there is a £ tax on an economy ticket. This is a huge leap from  when it was just £.There is no environmental justication, it is simply used to fill the Treasury’s coffers. Slashing it will also boost businesses hoping to sell products outside of the EU.It will show Brexit Britain is an outward-looking, global nation.We hope you’re listening, Mr Hammond.JEREMY Kyle was inspired to see a doctor after reading a Sun article about testicular cancer.Before that, the TV favourite had been hesitant to seek advice after he found a lump.One in  blokes will have testicular cancer in their letime.

Friends of Liam Fox have briefed newspapers that he is also concerned, given that his job - securing trade deals globally - depends on the UK leaving the EU customs union.Mrs May has survived multiple resignations, but with her backbenchers already in revolt, further cabinet walkouts over Brexit could prompt a failure of confidence in her leadership.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey\"\" data-targeting-\"\" data-tag\"\" data-component-name\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label\"Advertisement\" id\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance\"\""},{"url":null,"title":"brexit deal statement theresa may","story":"NewsTheresa May mauled in Brexit statement by her own Tory MPs as UK talks with EU hit deadlockTories including Boris Johnson challenged the embattled Prime Minister to her face as last-ditch bids to get a deal with the EU lay in ruinsShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video boris-johnson-challenges-theresa-over-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Theresa May was mauled today by her own Tory MPs in a torturous House of Commons statement after Brexit talks hit deadlock.The embattled Prime Minister addressed Parliament for almost two hours as a last-ditch bid to get a deal lay in ruins - just  hours before she meets  EU leaders for a crucial summit. Mrs May was due to speak to French President Emmanuel Macron tonight as UK sources admitted they had a signicant problem - and she was warned No Deal Brexit is probably inevitable. The Tory leader was supposed to reach a deal at this weeks moment of truth summit, allowing her to move to a final crossing the Ts summit in November. But last night Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab made a major unplanned trip to Brussels, only to stride away dramatically rejecting the EUs offer.  Today Mrs May insisted she was standing up to the EU and progress was being made. But Tory Brexiteers smelt a crucial climbdown - and hounded her over it. Crucially, the PM all but confirmed she is refusing to set a firm end date on her backstopplan to keep EU customs rules across the UK. This plan would avoid damaging border checks in Northern Ireland. But init would ban the UK from striking trade deals - enraging Tories. The backstop is supposed to end in December  - but Mrs May repeatedly refused to set that date in stone today.That was despite demands from several Tory MPs including Boris Johnson and Iain Duncan Smith, as well as Jeremy Corbyn and Brexit Committee chairman Hilary Benn. Mrs May insisted we are not going to be trapped permanently, adding: I want to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution. But she later admitted: It is there for the time until the future relationship can come into place. One Tory MP, Simon Clarke, declared devastatingly: She has failed to reassure the House. Labour MP Alex Sobel added: She has put the country into Hotel Calornia, that we can check out any time but never leave. MPs burst out laughing in the first words of Mrs Mays statement when she said Brexit talks were in their final stages. Later MPs chortled for a second time when Mrs May said two problems remain - and one MP was heard to quip Boris!  Meanwhile Mrs May confirmed the EU is now seeking a backstop to the backstop - a backup plan to their backup plan - while talks continue over her plan for an all-UK customs union. The backup backup is needed because the backup cant be negotiated in time in the next few weeks, Mrs May said. But Mrs May said the backup backup was unacceptable in its current form because it would install border checks between Northern Ireland and Britain. We cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom, the Prime Minister declared.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn fumed: This really is beginning to feel like Groundhog Day.Another nothing has changed moment from this shambles of a government.  Mr Corbyn demanded to know how long the backup plan might last - one year, two years, five years, more  Britain deserves better than this. He added: The blindfold Brexit they’re cooking up is a bridge to nowhere and a dangerous leap into the dark. Talks between the EU and UK are still in deadlock over the issue of the Northern Ireland border.Mrs Mays DUP allies oppose any checks between Northern Ireland and Britain. But her own Tory MPs oppose any hint that the backup plan wont have a firm end date.Last night Downing Street pointedly refused to say Mrs May was hoping for a deal at Wednesdays EU leaders summit. They only said she is expecting progress.  And today Mrs Mays spokesman refused to be drawn on whether there is enough progress to win a special Brexit summit in November.Meanwhile the Prime Minister faces a two-pronged Tory pizza plot to topple her - with Cabinet ministers threatening to quit on one hand, and MPs prepared to trigger a leadership battle on the other.Preparations for quitting without a deal on  March  are now poised to spring into action within weeks. Top civil servants have warned contingency plans must start being put into effect by the end of the month - whatever the situation, the Times reports. Otherwise they face not being ready with stockpiles of medicine and extra customs and border checks in time for  March . Evena deal is reached between the UK and EU, it then has to pass a vote in the UK Parliament.  And Tory Brexiteers and the DUP have vowed to defeat any sign of compromise. Theresa May relies on her  DUP allies to prop her up because she has no majority.Today DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson told the Belfast News Letter: Given the way in which the EU has behaved and the corner theyve put Theresa May into, theres no deal which I can see at present which will command a majority in the House of Commons.So it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario.SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon also said today it appears unlikely a deal will be reached in time. If so, she said, the need to change course becomes all the more necessary as no responsible government should contemplate No Deal.The Scottish First Minister said it would be better to stay in the EU single market, extend the date of Brexit or even back a second EU referendum than be railroaded into a reckless blindfold Brexit.But former foreign secretary Mr Johnson said: In deciding to remain in the customs union,is guilty of a shameless U-turn and a betrayal of millions of people who voted Leave. Irelands ambassador to the UK, Adrian ONeill, warned the BBC: Time is running out, there is no doubt about that. In all member states, preparation for all eventualities are ramping up quite signicantly. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt admitted talks were going through a dficult period but that there was always going to be a moment like this. - October :  EU leaders meet Theresa May in Brussels for a moment of truth summit. It looks like a full deal wont be struck. But crucially, they will decide whether theres enough progress to call another summit in November. End of October : No Deal preparations have to begin in the UK government no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time.  October : The Budget. It will spell out no deal preparations and be a test of loyalty for the DUP, who are supposed to vote with the government but could rebel. Mid-November : The UK is hoping for a final Brexit summit where she it seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. This is danger moment one, where Theresa Mays Cabinet ministers could resign or trigger a leadership coup. End of November : MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will be in deep, deep troubleshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - will end.  Arriving in Brussels for a meeting of the EU Foreign Affairs Council he said a deal was still possiblethere was goodwill on all sides. But Brexiteer Cabinet ministers were tonight plotting over pizza how to kill off Theresa Mays plan - while reports suggest she has  no confidence letters against her, four short of triggering a leadership battle. Tory MP Nadine Dorries suggested installing Cabinet quitter David Davis - who has called for a Cabinet insurrection - as interim leader. And former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson demanded Mrs May chuck her plans, adding: The EU is treating this country with naked contempt.

The national interest is largely forgotten with Brexit a battleground for Tory rivals, bloodlust opponents agonising over what’s best for them rather than the country. When the post of Prime Minister’s the goal of wavering Ministers calculating whether it’s better to back or sack May, the jobs of millions who voted to Leave and Remain are collateral damage for Tories obsessed with their own futures. I’ve never witnessed a Government disintegrate with the poisonous animosity of May’s collapsing regime. The reigns of Thatcher, Major, Blair, Brown and particularly Cameron finished in acrimony – an iron law of politics the tenure of all PMs end in failure. Yet this Conservative uncivil war’s unmatched in bile, squabbling Tories too busy scoring points against each other to champion Britain in negotiations with  united European neighbours.  At such a crucial juncture for the country, revolting Conservative MPs coming close to submitting the  letters triggering a self-indulgent leadership contest is proof Brexit is all about them, not you. Plastic patriots, right-wing nationalists blindly waving flags to hide their cluelessness, call the shots in a misgoverning party’s increasing Ukipisation that is symbolised by the membership of a purple Colonel Blimp former MEP, offensive reactionary Godfrey Bloom. So Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey fret over staying or going, boosting or ruining their chances of the Premiership. Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid fuss over supporting or opposing May’s Brexit plan for the same reasons.  And David Davis and Boris Johnson compete to be the most aggressive quitter. Whatever Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, another with his eye on the personal prize, agrees with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier is irrelevantMay loses the Tory Party, never mind Parliament. She is left relying on Labour rebels in a salvage operation, just as Ted Heath depended on John Smith to take us into Europe in . The best deal remains Britain’s continued EU membership. The tragedy is too many MPs are scared to tell the truth.

The Prime Minister faced embarrassing scenes in the opening words of her major statement to the House of Commons. Later MPs burst out laughing for a second time when Mrs May said two problems remain - and one MP was heard to quip Boris! Mrs May addressed MPs as last-ditch bids to get a deal with the EU failed just  hours before she meets  fellow leaders in Brussels. The PM was mauled by her own Tory MPs as she all but confirmed she is refusing to set a firm end date on her backstop - backup - plan to keep EU customs rules across the UK.  She repeatedly refused to confirm she would set an end date when questioned by MPs including Jeremy Corbyn, Boris Johnson and Brexit Committee chairman Hilary Benn. This proposal has enraged Tory Brexiteers who believe it will allow the EU to keep Britain tied into Brussels rules with no escape. Mrs May today said we are not going to be trapped permanently, adding: I want to be able to look the British people in the eye and say this backstop is a temporary solution. And she told Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith she would expect that to end by December ”.  But she again failed to guarantee an end date - risking a Tory rebellion. Meanwhile Mrs May confirmed the EU is now seeking a backstop to the backstop - a backup plan to their backup plan - while talks continue over what she wants to achieve. The backup backup is needed because the backup cant be negotiated in time in the next few weeks, Mrs May said. She added, however, that this backup backup will drive a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.And that policy was rejected last night when Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab made a failed last-minute dash to Brussels.We cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom, the Prime Minister declared. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn fumed: This really is beginning to feel like Groundhog Day.Another nothing has changed moment from this shambles of a government. Mr Corbyn demanded to know how long the backup plan might last - one year, two years, five years, more  Britain deserves better than this. He added: The blindfold Brexit they’re cooking up is a bridge to nowhere and a dangerous leap into the dark. And he urged her to for once make the right decision and put her country before her party. But a red-faced Mrs May accused him of trying to “frustrate the people’s vote and frustrate Brexit”.The furious Prime Minister declared: We never hear from the Labour Party what deal it is they want!"},{"url":null,"title":"tory brexiteer makes astonishing false","story":"NewsTory Brexiteer makes astonishing  claim about Brexit with just weeks to go to seal a dealAndrew Bridgen hasnt quite got his head around the big sticking point in Theresa Mays negotiationsShareCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video mp-andrew-bridgen-makes-astonishing-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A leading Tory Brexiteer has made an astonishing  claim about Brexit , just weeks before Britain’s deadline for fixing a deal.Andrew Bridgen, a long-time member of the European Research Group - a hard Brexit-backing group of Tory MPs - displayed a phenomenal lack of understanding about the Irish border problem in a radio interview. He claimed everyone in England is entitled to an Irish passport, which is both baffling and untrue. Speaking to BBC  Live’s Stephen Nolan, he claimed: “Well, thats the common travel area as well, isnt it  We do have the right to go over to Ireland, dont we  As an English person, I do have the right to go over to Ireland and I believe that I can ask for a passport. Cant I .”  And he suggested that on that basis, that solving the Irish border issue would be absolutely no problem at all. Under the Northern Ireland agreement, Northern Irish citizens can choose between a UK or an Irish passport. But that does not apply to the UK as a whole. But even after it was explained to him that his alarming assertion was untrue, he doubled down on his claim: “Theres a reciprocal agreement where I can go to Ireland and ask for an Irish passport and someone from Ireland can come to the UK and ask for a British passport. “We have that system. Thats the system we have, isnt it  Brexit talks have stumbled over how to prevent theof a hard border between the British province of Northern Ireland and EU-member Ireland after Britain leaves in its biggest sht in policy for more than  years. May, who has said repeatedly that she could not countenance the breakup of the United Kingdom, is struggling to find a way to satisfy the demands of not only the EU, but of her Conservative Party and her partners in parliament, Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party DUP .There has been little success in narrowing the gap between those competing demands, and Irelands Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said any deal would now take a bit more time than many people had hoped.

As time runs out, plans are now being put into action while the nations politicians try to escape their deadlock over a Brexit deal. If theres no arrangement in time, well lose  international trade deals in a blink, shed access to EU criminal databases and have to stockpile food and medicine at the stroke of pm. The government has issued  technical notices on the practical effects of No Deal - everything from driving licences to cats.  A lot of the effects are on business. UK farmers face a nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. Fishermen could be blocked from EU waters. And manufacturers fear their supply chains drying up. But thats not what whove written this guide for. More than enough has been written about business. Instead we have looked through the facts to establish  ways No Deal Brexit will affect you, the reader - and your everyday le. Of course, these are worst case scenarios. Theyre not exhaustive. They may never happen.  No Deal will happenBritain cant find a compromise between all these issues that keeps everyone happy enough before  March . It will mean falling back on World Trade Organisation trade tarfs - increase the price of imports and exports - and could leave legal black holes where EU law stood before. The UK government has been ramping up preparations for no deal since the beginning of summer .For more on how those negotiations are going click here. At the moment, British citizens can enter Schengen area countries with a valid passport eventhey only have a day left before they expire. But in a no deal Brexit, after  March  you may not be able to travel to these countriesyou have less than six months left on your passport. The government is advising travellers - children AND adults - to renew any passports that will have less than six months remaining validity at the time of their trip. If your passport does not meet these criteria, you may be denied entry to any of the Schengen area countries, and you should renew your passport before you travel, a government note warns. It goes on to say people with expiring passports should renew them soon because the passport office can get busy. The following are members of the Schengen Agreement: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.  There would be a huge surge in red tape for pet owners who want to take their beloved animals abroad.Currently dogs , cats and ferrets can travel anywhere in the EU as long as they have a pet passport.The main requirement is that three weeks before the first visit, owners must go to the vet to have their pet vaccinated against rabies and microchipped. But in the worst case no-deal Brexit, pet owners would have to visit a vet at least four months before visiting the EU. This means pet owners intending to travel to the EU on  March  would need to discuss requirements with their vet before the end of November , government papers warn.  The animal would have to have a rabies vaccination followed by a blood test at least  days before travel, to prove the vaccination worked. Once that was completed, the pet owner would have to visit a vet to obtain a health certicate. But this cannot be done more than  days before the date the holiday starts. This is the worst case scenario. In another form of No Deal Brexit, the UK could be made a listed third country. This would increase red tape but not as much, with a visit to the vet only needed three weeks before travel.  Flights could be grounded in a worse case No Deal Brexit. British airlines hoping to fly planes between the EU and UK would have to win permission from each separate country, the government admits. European firms wanting to carry passengers between Britain and the continent would have to seek authority from the UK. UK airlines would also lose the automatic right to fly planes between two EU destinations, such as Milan and Paris. The government says it envisages granting permission to EU airlines and getting permission to fly in the EU. But Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said there was a risk that flights would be groundedgoodwill fails. He told MPs: “It’s not implausible, it’s not impossible. It could happen deliberately, it could happen by mistake. It depends on how friendly or unfriendly the accompanying music is while all this goes on.” . You should get insurance and flexible tickets for Eurostar disruption Eurostar services could be suspended in a no deal Brexit.The government has told international train passengers - including the Eurostar - to make sure they have insurance and ticket terms and conditions that are sufficient to cover possible disruption. That implies passengers should buy FLEXIBLE tickets - not the fixed cheap ones that are popular for their low cost. The UK will need bilateral deals with France, Belgium and the Netherlands to ensure international trains keep running. Without such a deal, Britain has proposed recognising EU operator licences until March  to ensure services can continue. But this isnt guaranteed, and UK operators would have to reapply with the EU. Former Transport Secretary Andrew Adonis claimed the notice seems to be saying that the vital train link between Britain and Europe could be severed. . You might have to go through airport security twice  Air passengers changing flights in the EU may have to undergo two security screenings under a no-deal exit. Travellers boarding a plane in the UK to fly to a European airport, before changing flights for an onward destination, would be screened in Britain as they are now. But they might have to have a second check in the EU before getting their connecting flight. “Currently passengers flying from the UK and transferring at an EU airport for an onward flight do not have to be re-screened at that EU airport, because the UK applies, and exceeds, the EU baseline aviation security measures,” says a Department for Transport briefing note. “If there is no deal, and the EU decides not to recognise the UK aviation security system, then passengers and their luggage will have to be re-screened when changing flights in EU hub airports.” . You could be barred from using Netflix and Spoty on holiday  Britons could be barred from accessing their accounts for Netflix, Spoty and other online entertainment while travelling to EU statestheres a no-deal Brexit. Under the EU-wide portability regulation, which took force in April, citizens can access accounts set up and based in one country while visiting other member states. But a government technical notice said: The portability regulation will cease to apply to UK nationals when they travel to the EU. This means online content service providers will not be required or able to offer cross-border access to UK consumers under the EU Regulation. UK consumers may see restrictions to their online content services when they temporarily visit the EU. . Youll find it harder to drive in the EU  Currently a UK driving licence is the only thing visitors need to get behind the wheel on the continent. But under a no-deal Brexit, you may need an International Driving Permit. The pound. documents would be sold at , post offices from February. Currently theyre sold at fewer than . The number of permits issued would have to soar from , a year to million. Meanwhile you will also be forced to apply for a green card to prove you have the right car insurance. The certicates are free of charge and available from insurance companies. But the government warns firms may increase administration fees in order to cope with the extra bureaucracy. Those who forget their green cards would be forced to buy expensive frontier insurance in the country they are visiting. . Your mobile phone roaming charges may be hiked  Mobile phone roaming charges could be hiked - less than two years after they were slashed across the EU. Costs were cut in June , meaning there is no extra fee for using a British device on the continent for calls, texts and data. Operators would not be bound by the agreementthe UK crashes out without a deal. The biggest companies, servicing % of customers - Three, EE, O and Vodafone - have no plans to reimpose roaming charges after Brexit. But in terms of the entire mobile market, surcharge-free roaming when you travel to the EU could no longer be guaranteed, the government has warned. . If you live in Northern Ireland, you face electricity blackouts  Northern Ireland will be forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. A worst-case No Deal Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic - leaving it without any legal basis. This would make both markets less efficient, with potential effects for producers and consumers on both sides of the border, the government warns. And it may be necessary to seek additional [legal] powers to preserve security of supply. To stop the lights going out, Northern Ireland would have to take more electricity from British power stations through an interconnector running under the Irish Sea. But Northern Irelands Transmission System Operator may need to rely on fall-back arrangements to ensure power keeps flowing, the government warns. That is why, eventheres a no deal, the government will take all possible measures to keep the all-island market running. There has been talk of barges in the Irish Sea.Dustin Benton of Green Alliance warned: Any emergency action to keep the lights on, both in Northern Ireland and across the rest of the UK, would likely be highly polluting and expensive.. You could be stranded on your package holiday  Package holidaymakers could be left stranded with no legal protectionthe firm they booked with goes bust. Currently Brits have insolvency protectionthey book with a package holiday provider thats based anywhere in the EU. But in a No Deal Brexit, that protection would only applythe firms are targeting the UK market. That means those booking with, say, a cheaper Spanish firm online that has no UK presence could be unprotected. Eventhe UK government could act, in practice it will be much harder to take enforcement action against foreign firms because other countries will no longer recognise UK courts. . Youll lose rights to take action over dangerous products  Government documents reveal the same problem - UK courts not being recognised - will strip Brits of their consumer rights for EU goods bought online. Alex Neill of consumer group Which  warned: A no-deal Brexit would massively weaken peoples rights to take action when they purchase faulty or dangerous products from outside the UK. The Governments advice that we all become experts in international consumer law is hopelessly unrealistic. Securing a good deal with the EU is vital to ensure that Brexit doesnt result in a bonfire of consumer rights and protections.” . Your cigarette packets will change Graphic warnings on cigarette packets will be replaced by Australian versions in a no-deal Brexit.And in some ways they are even more gruesome than the ones we have now. The grim pictures show a foot ridden with peripheral vascular disease, a clogged artery, a bleeding brain and high-resolution teeth stained black. The photos will be changed in a No Deal Brexit because the European Commission owns theon ones we currently use. That means the UK would be unable to use them after  March . . If youre going through a family breakdown, you could be trapped in limbo  Families who are midway through orce or child custody cases involving another EU country could find themselves trapped in limbo. If there’s a no deal Brexit, the UK will cease to be part of co-operation between EU family courts on  March . Instead the UK will fall back on legal conventions drawn up in The Hague. But these are complicated and do not cover every area of the law. The government has advised families with ongoing cases to seek legal advicethey will not finish by Brexit Day. A government technical note says: Broadly speaking, cases ongoing on exit day will continue to proceed under the current rules. However, we cannot guarantee that EU courts will follow the same principle, nor that EU courts will accept or recognise any judgments stemming from these cases.” . Your cheap holiday bus to the continent faces being cancelled  The government warns UK coach operators may be unable to access the EU at all. Currently, the EU is part of the “Interbus Agreement”, which allows for coach operators to run occasional and regular services in other countries. The plan is for Britain to rejoin the agreement as a third country member. The new agreement will only apply to occasional services - so coach holidays and tours can continue. But regular services would not be permitted. The documents urge UK operators to rewrite their terms and conditions to allow them to subcontract some or all of their journeys to EU-based operators. The document also warns new checks at EU borders are could cause delays at ports. But the government promises “contingency arrangements to manage the flow of traffic.” - October :  EU leaders meet Theresa May in Brussels for a moment of truth summit. It looks like a full deal wont be struck. But crucially, they will decide whether theres enough progress to call another summit in November. End of October : No Deal preparations have to begin in the UK government no matter what, because otherwise they wont be ready on time.  October : The Budget. It will spell out no deal preparations and be a test of loyalty for the DUP, who are supposed to vote with the government but could rebel. Mid-November : The UK is hoping for a final Brexit summit where she it seal not just a deal, but a political declaration on future trade. This is danger moment one, where Theresa Mays Cabinet ministers could resign or trigger a leadership coup. End of November : MPs hold a vote on any deal in Parliament. This is danger moment two for Theresa May, who will be in deep, deep troubleshe loses the vote. She claims the UK will leave with No Deal anywayshe loses. But Labour say she should be forced back to the negotiating table call a general election or even trigger a second EU referendum.  March : Brexit Day. If theres a deal, this will be a total anticlimax because a transition will be in place. If theres No Deal, planes could be grounded, ports jammed up and customs checks thrown into chaos at pm.  December : If theres a deal, this is when the transition period - which continues pretty much all the EU rules we have now - will end. Tory ministers could hand corporate giants a massive tax cut in a No Deal Brexit , a top Cabinet figure revealed in October.Dominic Raab said the government will “pull every lever weve got” to ease business “disruption”the UK leaves the EU with no agreement in March . The Brexit Secretary even left open a radical idea of slashing corporation tax from % to % - which would firms a huge tax break while millions of working families struggle. He spoke on the fringes of the Tory conference hours after Chancellor Philip Hammond said he was reserving “fiscal firepower” to “support the economy” in No Deal Brexit. A leaked warning revealed NHS chiefs fear RUNNING OUT of drugs in a chaotic No Deal Brexit .NHS Providers, the body for inidual hospital trusts, sounded the alert in a private memo to Tory ministers and the head of the NHS. The bodys chief executive Chris Hopson declared there is a lack of communication nationally about the consequences of leaving the EU without a deal. Without national planning and coordination, there could be both stockpiles and shortages of medicines and medical devices, he wrote.  As a result, Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patientstheres no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lesaving drugsports are blocked, meaning they cant be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: Were working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  Currently, popular ingredients in cold medicines can usually be traded within the EU without a licence. In a no deal, a licence will be required to trade these so-called precursors. Sowe leave without a deal, firms who want to trade such chemicals with the EU will have to register with the Home Office, which can cost between pound and pound,. They will also need an import export license, which costs pound. Critics say this could push up prices for consumers in the shops. Similarly, cosmetics firms will be slapped with more red tape to prove their products are safe for human health. Currently they can use one legal “nominated person” to certy a product for the whole EU market. Butthere’s a no deal Brexit, UK checks won’t be recognised in the EU - and EU checks wont be recognised in the UK. That means two sets of checks. Labour MP Owen Smith claimed drug giants will look to pass on the costs. . Your local supermarket giant faces having to stockpile food  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiledwe crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling.Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added: This is notjustabout stockpiling. Presumably it’s MS stockpiling.. You could be affected by civil unrest  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - and the firm is planning for such an outcome.Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening.A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, eventhose scenarios are very unlikely. The government has been actively hiring experts on civil emergencies to deal with leaving the EU. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government recruited three pound,-a-year workers to do the disaster job. The job description warned any takers must ensure public authorities are ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover from civil emergencies of all types. A major motorway is being closed overnight for more than a month in the run-up to Christmas so it can be turned into a lorry park in case of a no-deal Brexit .Highways England began preparations in October for the M in Kent to be used as a holding area for lorriesthere is gridlock at ports like Dover. But the plan was not disclosed to local councillors or MPs until just hours before work began. Tom Tugendhat, Tory MP for Tonbridge and Malling, was furious. He said his community was kept in the dark about the M work after receiving assurances that nothing was planned. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Tugendhat said: Its come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members.  Caviar imports will be snarled up or stop completely in a No Deal Brexit. Sturgeon eggs join snowdrops, orchids and reptiles in endangered species that would need import and export permits to cross an EU border. Youd only be allowed to bring in g of caviar for personal use. A tragedy.

A -year-old man was left in an induced coma after being savaged by the animal in a flat in Haddington, East Lothian, on October , reports the Daily Record . A pal of the woman who lives at the address and owns the bulldog said it was named after the slain US musician. And they described the pet as an “absolute angel”.  It comes as rumours swirled around the town that the injured man had been held down during the attack. His testicles and penis were understood to have been bitten off.

News of Meghans pregnancy was made public just hours after the couple landed in Sydney to begin their royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Fans of the royal family were overjoyed at the happy news, which came just days after the UK celebrated Princess Eugenies wedding . However, some people couldnt help but draw a connection with the timing of the babys arrival and another massive change going on in the UK at the moment. Self-confessed cynics on Twitter thought the timing of the news couldnt possibly be a coincidence - because the baby would arrive at around the same time the UK will leave the European Union.  The baby news and wide media coverage would be a welcome distraction from what is likely to be Britain crashing out without a deal. Jason Wells even tweeted to Theresa May saying: Ahh bless! A new Royal baby conveniently arriving around the time of Brexit . Bet its just a crazy coincidence! Congrats! Another wrote: Call me a raving cynic, but isnt it funny that when a crucial point in the Brexit negotiations is reached theres another royal baby announcement  The news came the same morning it was revealed Theresa May will be forced to make an urgent statement after Brexit talks with the EU hit a deadlock. This morning the DUP, her key allies, declared a no-deal Brexit is probably inevitable. Still, the news of Meghans pregnancy was welcomed by many on social media.  One wrote on Twitter: Lovely news to awake up .. a little one on the way for Harry  Meghan. Dont understand the ugliness that such beautul news brings. A loving couple adding a child to their loving family seems like a beautul thing .. whoever that couple is! Only much happiness for all! Another said: With so much discord and sadness in the world, its so lovely to hear some good news. A new baby is a reminder of hope. Congratulations Harry and Meghan. Others were happy for the couple but still deeply suspicious about the timing, writing: Brilliant timing again - the new royalbabywill be born in the spring. So thatll be about the time of Brexit and the peoples minds and media will be distracted. Coincidence  Some jokingly suggested the loved-up couple should name their baby Brexit. Harry and Meghan have made no secret of the fact they wanted to start a family.  The prince said in : “I’d love to have kids right now.” He added in his engagement interview: “One step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.” Meghan also confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, saying: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” Kensington Palace announced that Harry and Meghan are expecting their child on Twitter this morning.

Jane Gretton, who has a -year-old daughter at the school, said: I am absolutely appalled by these voting slips, it is more like something out of an American school and to me it is just another form of bullying. To be asking questions like who has the best bum at that age is just ridiculous. They are young people andthere are children at the school who have hang ups over their body or their personality, then it could affect their mental heath in the fuutre. I thought schools were meant to be stopping this sort of thing. It is ridiculous and inappropriate.  Having said all this, I think Highfields is a fantastic school. I have had two children who were there right up to A-level and are doing really well because of what they learnt at the school. These awards are not right though and I hope they are stopped. Award categories included most likely to become Prime Minister, sportiest, funniest, friendliest and those most likely to become a millionaire or be late to their own wedding Parents have fumed though as the awards also include best bum, flirtiest, most lovable rogue, teachers pet and best looking.

Research has found that only . percent of drivers are claiming to have modications on their vehicle, suggesting drivers simply may not be declaring any added extras. GoCompare are warning motorists to double check what the factory standard is for your cars model, and let insurers know of any changes made.  Matt Oliver, spokesperson for GoCompare car insurance, said: “While modications may ring bells of the bygone boy racer, it’s worth remembering that insurers don’t just class body kits, exhaust systems or suspension changes as vehicle modications. “The average used car buyer could find there are modications they’re simply not aware of. Typically, modications are anything which isn’t standard on a car, which could include alloy wheels, a satellite navigation system or even tinted windows – so it’s always worth checking what the factory standard is for your model of car to avoid landing in hot water when it comes to making a claim. “Under two percent of drivers are claiming to have car modications, but we estimate this figure to be much greater, which leaves potentially millions of drivers open to invalidating their insurance and having their claims rejected.  Mr Oliver added: “Dferent insurers have dferent views on what constitutes a modication – so it’s always wise to tell your insurer of changes or additions you make to your vehicle at the time of making them. “Otherwise you could find yourself in the situation of having a claim rejected and possibly your car insurance declared void - that could affect your ability to be insured full stop, and not only for car insurance. “Shop around and look for the best deal that suits you and your car, andin doubt, check the service history for any modication and speak to your insurance provider.” "},{"url":null,"title":"three men way chop mans","story":"NewsThree men on their way to chop off a mans b***s arrested by police carrying a kne, hammer and a scalpelZackery Podmore, , Chandler Gallimore,  and Jordan Burton, , were overheard plotting their castration plans by a young woman who tipped off policeShareCommentsByTom DavidsonOnline Reporter:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsChandler Gallimoreand Zachery Podmorearriving at Hanley Crown Court \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThree men who planned to chop off a mans testicles were arrested by police and found in possession of a kne, hammer and scalpel.

They were surrounded by their bridesmaids and page boys in two snaps, which inevitably had people asking the big question: how do you get eight young children to smile at a camera simultaneously  It looks like it might have proven quite dficult.

But when her son got undressed in the evening, she was shocked by the marks on his body and went to school the next morning demanding answers. Mrs Grayson told CNN: We were getting ready for bed, and when I pulled his shirt off, I saw cuts and bruises on his body. That didnt look like marks of someone helping him get up.

In a statement, Lisa Deffendall, a spokeswoman for the school district, said: There is absolutely no tolerance for the conduct of the employee in this incident, and while we cannot discuss specics, we do want to reassure our families that we take any situations of this nature very seriously.  Our training is very explicit that physical restraint is a last resort only to be used when a student is a danger to themselves or others. The training also shows employees the proper ways to hold or transport students. In this case, neither of those standards were met.

From jacket potatoes to beans on toast, a sprinkling of cheese is the ideal finishing touch to plenty of Brits typical meals. It will therefore come as a complete shock to you that youve probably been doing it wrong for this entire time. If, like most people, the way you grate is by standing the grater upright and scraping the cheese along the blades in a downward motion over a bowl - then this genius method will change everything.  It turns out that lying the grater on its side and scraping the hunk of cheese horizontally is actually a much smarter way of doing it. All of the cheese collects inside the grater for you to then sprinkle as desired, so its a much tidier process with less random strands falling off and making a big old mess. It also gives you more control over the cheese and makes grazing your fingers less likely. Ideal.A Twitter user spotted the clever hack in a video by Tastemade UK for a mac and cheese recipe and wrote: OK, I was today years old when I found out THIS is how a cheese grater is used !  I feel a fool. The social media user is not the only one whose world was shook by the revelation. The post received over , likes and , comments from people whose minds have been blown.

A second Twitter user agreed: Literally cheese grating will never be the same again.  Another said they are mind blown and someone  commented that it all makes sense now. Some people dispute the smart trick, saying grating is much easier when you have gravity on your side while others expressed concern about the grater damaging the worktops.

But not content with raping her, Mekuli, , demanded his victim wipe down the windows to get rid of his fingerprints. Mekuli had broken into the property through the window and presumably wanted to remove any evidence of his presence. The teenager from Hamilton on New Zealands North Island has been sentenced to an eight year stretch behind bars.  He appeared in Hamilton District Court last Friday where he faced charges for rape, threatening to kill, sexual violation, attempted kidnapping, burglary and assault on a child.The -year-old victim told the NZ Herald she was really disappointed with the sentence as its hard to live a normal le following the ordeal.She said: He almost killed me and he almost killed my daughter. I still cant believe that it happened in my own place. How can this happen in New Zealand  Mekuli, then , broke into his victims home via a window which had been left open on the morning of April . He stole cash and made his way into the bedroom where the victim was sleeping with her daughter.  He jumped onto the bed and strangled the mother and daughter despite their screams and resistance. Details of the horric and y attack were revealed in court. Mekuli pulled the woman into the hallway and forced her to remove her clothes. He raped the woman three times, punched her in the face and ordered her to perform oral sex while her daughter was forced to watch.He also performed oral sex on her, Stuff reported.At the end of the horric violation, the woman was punched in the face a second time and forced to wipe down the windowsills to remove Mekulis fingerprints. The victims managed to escape to a neighbours house after the teenager demanded he be driven away from the crime scene. Police were called and Mekuli was tracked down six days later.  The court heard the teenager had been smoking methamphetamine in the two days before the incident. Judge Louis Bidois told the court the victims le had been totally destroyed by the ordeal. Crown prosecutor Louella Dunn said the victim lost confidence and struggled to go about normal activities of le including sleeping, exercising and socialising. Ms Dunn sought a minimum of  years in jail claiming the community needed to be protected. She said: There is a risk of re-offending. There is a risk to the public. Defence counsel Sacha Nepe argued for a lower sentence as the teenager endured a tough childhood involving domestic violence and drug use. Mekuli, who showed no remorse for his victim, was sentenced to eight years in jail as the judge allowed a % discount for a guilty plea and his youth.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run.

His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::.

There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour.

It means the state-of-the-art school is well on track for opening its doors to pupils and staff in October . Built in the grounds of the existing academy, the new school is keenly anticipated as it’s set to not only transform learning and teaching, but will also signicantly enhance facilities for the local community. The new building will have space for up to  young people, with modern classrooms, massive games hall, two all-weather pitches, games courts and a host of other exciting facilities which are sure to impress pupils, staff and the wider public. Kier Construction is building the school, which is being delivered by South Ayrshire Council in partnership with hub South West. The project is part of a poundmillion programme of works delivered across South Ayrshire with the aim of boosting education standards through targeted investment in schools and communities. Councillor Peter Henderson, the council’s resources and performance portfolio holder, said: “Our new, extended and refurbished schools are completely transforming learning across South Ayrshire and the new Queen Margaret Academy is shaping up to do more of the same. We’re committed to creating modern learning environments that not only inspire children and young people, but provide an important hub and network for the local community. “We want those attending our schools to achieve their full potential when they move on from school and our focus on providing the best education possible, with the best facilities, means we are on our way to achieving this ambition. “Our schools always play a key role in local le so we’re ensuring that their excellent sports facilities can be accessed by the wider public. We also ensure there are areas of our schools that can be used by community groups and the new Queen Margaret Academy will be no dferent.” Michael McBrearty, chief executive of delivery partner, hub South West Scotland, said: “The new school will be a fantastic contemporary and innovative learning environment that will create an abundance of opportunities and benefits to the entire community.” Brian McQuade, managing director of Kier Construction Scotland  north-east England, said: “Up to  people have been on site during peak periods of activity and to date we have created one apprenticeship, seven work placements and three student summer intern placements. This has provided young local talent the opportunity to gain valuable experience working on a state-of-the-art building and a unique insight into the built environment and the erse range of roles available.” Oonagh Browne headteacher at Queen Margaret Academy said: “It’s exciting to see our new school taking shape. Parents, young people and staff were crucial in planning the facilities for our new school, so it’s very much their project and this only increases their anticipation”. The Bishop of Galloway, Right Reverend William Nolan said: “While the ground works were taking place little seemed to be happening on site but in recent months the structure of the building has sprung up, giving a sense of excitement and anticipation as we look forward to the completion next year of a centre of learning that will inspire our young people.” When the new school opens, the old building will be demolished and the site fully landscaped.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEducationSchoolsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"60k christmas lights up grabs","story":"Alexandra McCready switches on the lights with the help of the cast of the Ayr Gaiety pantomime Cinderella.\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA pound, Christmas lights fund is up for grabs in villages and towns needing an illumination boost. But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade. It was later learned that she had a high level of GHB in her blood – the date-rape drug. Strathclyde Union is among the nightclubs and bars that were prompted by the campaign and have gone on to order  lids on a trial basis as they work on ways to keep students as safe as possible on nights out.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Speaking to the Post, the chief inspector, declared: “Since I left school I had always wanted to join the police - with my traditional up bringing, I wanted to be part of the community. “As an operational officer, I have always worked in Ayrshire - when I first joined I started in the three towns, finished my probation and then moved to Millport as the local bobby. “It was an interesting but good experience - my family were young at the time - it was a Hamish MacBeth lestyle where I had the house that was built on to the police station. “What you learn at that point when you’re working yourself is in the winter you are working with your local community, but when you’re working throughout the summer time, you have the tourists - this is when the island community went from  upto , a day and you are still working yourself with the help of special constables. This is when you learn your people skills. I was there for three and a half years - you involve yourself with the community - it was just amazing. “It was a highlight for personal reasons, for family reasons, for friends you make for le and for the grounding it gives you in getting to know people. “I came back to Ayr in  as an operational police officer then I left the Division and worked in national security for a while which was really interesting. “It got to  and I wanted to come back to operational policing so I ed to Ayr as an operational inspector. “For the third time in my career, I’m back. To be a police officer, an inspector and now get the position of Area Commander in Ayr and to have lived, studied and met my we in Ayr, both personal and professional is just great. “The whole ethos of policing, for me, is community. “I am absolutely delighted to be Area Commander of South Ayrshire and I would like to thank Chief Inspector Gary I`Anson for everything that he has done for South Ayrshire and the key role that he has played over the last few years.” "},{"url":null,"title":"end motoring era ayr","story":"NewsEnd of a motoring era in AyrShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt’s the end of an era after a well-known motor garage closed its doors for the final time after eight decades in Ayr. Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"shops replace homes new ayr","story":"NewsShops to replace homes in new Ayr town centre regeneration plansPeople to have their say on radical proposalsShareBySarah Hilley:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShops are to be replaced with homes in Ayr town centreradical new plans get the go-ahead. Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

It was a lovely calm and sunny day, perfect for filming,I was halfway through the story when a group of local teenage lads approached. It seemed they were drinking and I anticipated them disrupting the filming.But I continued telling the story as it had been a perfect take up until that moment.The lads paused for a moment then all sat on the concrete walkway watching me and the film makers. They said nothing and seemed to be listening.I was able to complete my story uninterrupted.And as I walked away in the final shot I made eye contact with the lads and they respectfully waited until the filming had stopped before shouting, ldquoJohnny Moat forever! Then they got up and walked away.It was an unexpected and powerful moment for me.My assumptions about the lads had been utterly challenged as well.This was more than six years ago but I was reminded of it when I visited Johnny Moat this week with my wee boy Lewis.We were having our weekly storytelling walk in the Pans, a three-hour period between his nursery pick up and when I have to pick up his sister Skye from the Infant School.We just walk together visiting dferent places, and I tell him stories and he does the same.Most of his stories this day involved a T Rex or Raptor, which in his imagination wander about Prestonpans.So our respective tales were a bit dferent in content and style, but what is vital at this age is that he hears stories and is allowed to tell them freely.I told him the story of Johnny Moat and he said it looks like a whale.As we wandered from Johnny Moat up to Preston Tower, we stopped at what we call the lsquoStory Stonesrsquo.Here a small circle of stones sit underneath a cherry tree, with the tower looming behind. It is a perfect place to tell stories.Lewis gave me a new version of his T Rex tale here. I couldnrsquot understand all his story, but I got most of it.Then he said it was my turn so I told him a child-friendly version of the tale of the Green Lady. It made him want to go and look in the windows of the tower, which we did.The final story began at the old doorsquocot in the gardens by the tower. I explained it was a house for pigeons, but Lewis was having none of that.ldquoNo daddy, he said with a serious face, ldquoa lion lives there.ldquoReally  Can you tell me the story of the lion  I asked. And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming. This, I think, is an antidote to that depressive winter effect. Maybe thatrsquos why the geese honk so much.

This week the authority of our constitution is on the line.The issue of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland is one of the last remaining obstacles to achieving a orce deal with Brussels, with wrangling continuing over the nature of a ldquobackstop to keep the frontier opena wider UK-EU trade arrangement cannot resolve it.The European Unionrsquos version, which would see just Northern Ireland remain aligned with Brusselsrsquo rules, has been called unacceptable by Mrs May and is loathed by the DUP.The Sunday Times said at least nine ministers want Mrs May to change course when the Cabinet meets on Tuesday.Speculation about possible resignations has centred on Andrea Leadsom, Penny Mordaunt and Esther McVey, but the newspaper also indicated that Scottish Secretary David Mundell and Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson could quit because special arrangements for Northern Ireland could fuel the case for Scottish independence.Mrs Mayrsquos own position also appeared in jeopardy, with as many as  letters demanding a vote of no confidence reportedly submitted to the Conservative  Committee ndash just four short of the number required to trigger a ballot.The Northern Irish situation is politically problematic for Mrs May because her minority administration depends on the votes of the  DUP MPs.A leaked email reported in the Observer indicated Mrs Foster was ready to block a Brexit deal.According to a private email exchange between senior UK officials, seen by the newspaper, Mrs Foster gave her views during a dinner with the leader of Conservative MEPs, Ashley Fox.The leaked email said Mrs Foster described the EUrsquos chief Brexit negotiator Mr Barnier as ldquodficult and hostile and indicated ldquothe DUP were ready for a no-deal scenario, which she now believed was the likeliest one.Writing in the Belfaston Saturday, Mrs Foster said she appreciated the risks of a no-deal Brexit but ldquothe dangers of a bad deal are worse.She added: ldquoThe DUPrsquos actions this week are not as some have suggested about lsquoflexing musclersquo.ldquoThis is no game.ldquoAnyone engaging in this in a light-hearted way foolishly fails to grasp the gravity of the decisions we will make in the coming weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"watchdog-criticises-snp-government-over-proposed-freedom-of-information-reforms","story":"Ministers agreed to make changes after the watchdog issued a critical report into the way the Government dealt with FOI in relation to groups including journalists.Daren Fitzhenry, the SIC, has now expressed concern about an apparent lack of ldquoclarity in the continuing role of special advisers and ministers in the process.Scotlandrsquos FOI law, which came into force in , gives citizens a right to information held by public bodies, unless it is covered by an exemption.However, journalists from across the media last year signed an open letter complaining about the way the SNP Government handled their requests.They complained of delaying tactics and requests being blocked or refused for tenuous reasons.The reporters also claimed that their questions were being routinely handled by special advisers, who are political appointees, and screened for potential political damage.Fitzhenry launched a review into the claims and he found that Government policy reinforced concerns of a two tier system for journalists, MSPs and political researchers.He concluded there had been ldquounjustiable, signicant delays and disregard for the statutory timescales and noted the Government took longer to respond to journalistsrsquo requests than others.Fitzhenryrsquos report also stated that the Government policies and procedures were not ldquoclear enough about the role of special advisers in responding to FOI requests.Oppositions politicians claimed that the role of special advisers amounted to interference in the FOI system.However, the Governmentrsquos ldquodraft action plan makes clear that special advisers ndash otherwise known as spads ndash will stay have a role at the end of the process.ldquoCases identied as sensitive or exceptionally complex will, after clearance, be referred to SPADs and ministers for comment, the draft states.In his response to Government, Fitzhenry said he was ldquocontent with the ldquomajority of the proposed actions, but noted: ldquoI note that, for example, cases identied as sensitive or exceptionally complex will be referred to special advisers and Ministers for comment after clearance.

I crept downstairs one night in the early s and opened the door to the living room without my mum and dad knowing. A film was on TV ndash this was during the glory days of the BBCrsquos late night weekend Horror Double Bill.It was The Masque of the Red Death ndash which I now declare to be the greatest horror film ever made. It was wild, terrying, demented. A man in a gorilla suit was burned alive by a dwarf, Death walked the Earth, nobles partied within the walls of a castle as the plague raged outside. It blew my tiny mind and scared me witless, but I kept silent, hidden behind the sofa, as I knew it was taboo andmy parents realised I was there, theyrsquod send me to bed.On screen was an actor I would come to love ndash Vincent Price as the evil Prince Prospero. My parents only discovered I was there when the National Anthem started playing, and they turned on the lights and found me, goggle-eyed like some creepy imp in flannel pyjamas.Irsquove spent the rest of my le watching horror films ndash so as the witching season approaches, and the latest Halloween movie gets ready to open in cinemas, I thought Irsquod give you a guide to the secrets of the genre ndash and tell you what really makes a fright flick tick.THE WOODSIt doesnrsquot have to be the woods ndash though it often is ndash but location is as important to a horror movie as it is to Kirsty Allsopp and Phil Spencer. Think of Jonathan Harkerrsquos journey to Transylvania ndash a scene which opens countless Dracula films. The mountains, the inn, the forest, the wolves, the fog, the night ... the castle. A Dracula movie would be as naked without its classic location as the count without his cape.A great location doesnrsquot have to be some gothic throwback either. Look at An America Werewolf in London ndash it fetishises both the English countryside and the grungy grimy London of the early s ndash or the spaceship in Alien, which becomes a white, pared-back, claustrophobic hunting ground.The ballsiest horrors find the most unlikely location and just go for it ndash all great horror films take enormous risks with everything from script to casting and lightning to sound ndash so how about: a creepy ballet school for girls, soaked in vivid technicolour, in Dario Argentorsquos Suspiria a ski lt in Frozeninside a grave in Buried a railway carriage in Train to Busana punk rock venue in The Green Room, or a locked house in Donrsquot Breathe.None of these films would workthe director had chosen another setting ndash the setting is as important as the characters, the killings, and the creeps that the films wring from you.THE JUMPSHave you ever caught the Luton Bus  Or rather the Lewton Bus  If yoursquove watched the s movie Cat People by Val Lewton then yoursquoll know what I mean.In one scene we see our heroine being hunted by a killer we expect to turn into a panther at any moment. The tension builds and just when wersquore sure itrsquos all going to end in blood and fur, a bus screeches by making viewers leap from their seats. Therersquos no murder, no mayhem ndash but it is famously the scariest part of the film. If you donrsquot jump at least once in a horror movie, whatrsquos the point, most fans would say  We come to be scared.Bad directors use music to make you jump ndash a screeching violin is not a scare ndash or cliche, like Jason Voorhees ndash the killer in the Friday the th franchise ndash leaping up from the dead just when we think wersquore safe. Great film-makers like Lewton use your mind to make you jump, nothing .What a good jump scare depends on is sudden unexpected movement ndash tapping into that fear we have of something unexplained glimpsed from the corner of your eye. Look at the \"Sloth\" scene in Seen: the camera lingers over a shrivelled body which police have found tied to a bed. Suddenly, the \"corpse\" moves, struggling in its bonds. The entire set-up is overturned ndash a body we thought was dead, isnrsquot.The switch itself implies something ghastly: whatever is on the bed has been suffering for months in agony. In one split-second, David Fincher physically and emotional terrorises us.Perhaps, the greatest jump scare is in the much underrated The Exorcist III where a satanic killer is on the loose. One two-minute scene features a static long shot of a hospital hall. A nurse is making her rounds at night ndash her red cardigan the only colour on screen.Nothing  happens ndash but we know something has to happen, this is a horror movie. Just as the audience is lulled into a sense of calm, a shroud-draped man with a giant pair of medical shears ndash the kind used for amputations ndash charges at the nurse from behind.I remember audibly screaming in the cinema in  at this scene ... I loved it.THE MONSTERThere are three main types of baddie in horror films: the Monster, the Psycho, and the Thing. Letrsquos start with the monster.First of all, the Monster isnrsquot human and thatrsquos whatrsquos frightening. Whether itrsquos the shark in Jaws, whatever the hell is in the woods in The Blair Witch Project, the house in The Haunting of Hill House, giant ants in the s creature feature Them!, the xenomorph in Alien, or the demons from The Mist ndash these monsters are relentless. They will not stop ndash and we cannot fathom what drives them, beyond a desire to kill, yet they also possess a preternatural human-like intelligence.Monsters create unanswered questions ndash and ignorance means fear: Why is this shark out for revenge  What is running wild in the woods  Why wonrsquot the house stop shaking  Why are those ants the size of a Ford Focus  Why is that alien hugging my face  What are demons doing in a suburban supermarket The Monster works on the fear of the unknown, or the ugly ndash fear of the non-human. The Monster plays on those deep-seated fears we experience as children ndash the creature under the bed at night, or something beneath your feet when yoursquore swimming.THE PSYCHOThe Psycho, however, works on the opposite emotion ndash the fear of fellow humans, that behind our smiles and civilised cappuccinos lie salivating lunatics eager to kill.What better place to start with the Psycho, then, than with Hitchcockrsquos Norman Bates. The original Psycho was based on a real murderer ndash a necrophile, mother-killing, grave-robbing Wisconsin weirdo called Ed Gein .The roots of the Psycho always lie in reality ndash thatrsquos the fear factor. Could we one day meet such killers in real le  Might we already know a Hannibal Lecter, the urbane cannibal psychiatrist with a nose for good perfume and an eye for cheap shoes a Patrick Bateman, the boardroom American Psycho a Jack Torrance from The Shining ndash the intellectual family man about to snap and kill.THE THINGWhen it comes to the Thing, itrsquos all about the Uncanny Valley ndash the psychological theory that when something resembles a human being closely, but just not quite enough, it elicits a horrible feeling of dread.Think of Nosferatursquos spindly long-fingered decaying fiend, the creature in the attic in Rec, Frankensteinrsquos creation bolted together from scraps of corpses, any zombie, the demonic Cenobites from Hellraiser, the baby in Eraserhead, possessed Regan in The Exorcist, even Hal from : A Space Odyssey.These creatures almost look like us, or in Halrsquos case sound like us, but we know they are not us ndash and so they scare the daylights out of us.THE SALLYIt was once standard operating procedure in horror films that there would always be a survivor ndash usually a woman, known in the industry by the slightly sexist term \"The Last Girl\".I prefer to call this survivor character \"The Sally\" in homage to the female lead in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Sally Hardesty, played by s scream queen Marilyn Burns. Texas is loved and hated in equal measure. Horror fans hail it as the darkest and cleverest of the ultra-violent classic slasher films.PhDs have been written on Texas. Itrsquos even been interpreted as a comment on Watergate ndash the deranged hill billy cannibal serial killers do live in a big \"white house\" after all. People who donrsquot watch horror films, though, detest Texas as little more that snuff-inspired torture porn.Director Tobe Hooper put his Sally character through hell at the hands of Leatherface, grandpa and the rest of the slavering clan. When I first watched Texas during the s video nasty era, I felt physically broken afterwards ndash the violence, the terror, the bestial nature of what was happening on screen literally overwhelmed me.But Sally survived ndash and because Sally survived, good won the day. Horror films often rely on such simply fairy tale tricks ndash make me feel scared but then offer hope that what scared me will be defeated and the result is Pavlovian, punters come back for more.Sally led to Laurie Strode, the lead character in the original  Halloween. Now Laurie is dferent to Sally. Sally does a lot of running and screaming and crying ndash Laurie does a lot of running and hiding and trying to breath quietly in cupboards, but then something very important happens: Laurie turns on the killer, the villain Michael Myers.In fact, at one point, we think shersquos killed Myers, clad in his creepy William Shatner face mask . But, in a tradition that Halloween basically forged, the bogeyman lives to kill another day. Nevertheless, he was still vanquished, for the time being at least, by the female protagonist who remains standing.Sometimes, though, The Sally doesnrsquot survive ndash a development seen increasingly in films with a strong artistic bent. In the nihilistic masterpiece Funny Games, Michael Hanekersquos Pinteresque descent into hell, the end is one of deliberate despair ndash no-one will live, and the killers are coming for you next.THE SEXESUnsurprisingly, given that horror exploits our real fears, most villains are men. Horror movies draw very heavily on a primordial battle of the sexes theme: the brutal killer, often a mere personication of evil, versus the sparky, clever woman pushed to the limits of endurance.However, not all horror films conform to the genre. Some switch, and the female villain is far from unknown ndash but when you analyse why the woman is a killer, itrsquos for very dferent reasons to the men.Women donrsquot pick up chainsaws and go on mindless murder sprees ndash women killers tend to act out psychologically, and that can can often create the greatest of screen villains. For proof, enter Annie Wilkes from Misery, an obsessive fan with a fine line in moral rectitudeand a taste for torture.In recent decades, more women began to pop up who should have been put in a straitjacket from birth. Therersquos Lola Stone in The Loved Ones ndash a girl you donrsquot want to invite to a house party Tina, a murderous National Trust nerd, in Ben Wheatleyrsquos black comedy of modern manners Sightseers and Marie, the worst best friend a girl ever asked for in the French new wave horror Switchblade Romance.Carrie is probably the most nuanced female character in any horror film ndash she is both villain and victim. Abused by a religious maniac mother, bullied and sexually humiliated by her classmates, Sissy Spacek as Carrie becomes the revenge prototype of teen female anger.Increasingly, wersquore beginning to see men enter the role of the victim. Take the Belgian movie The Ordeal. Instead of a woman held captive by a male predator, it is a man who is imprisoned and tormented: a good way to bring home to the audience that often the gaze in horror films is on female suffering.THE MEANINGA great horror film has to say something ndash an awful horror film just drips blood all over the cinema seat and leaves you as unsatisfied as a ten pound box of popcorn. By \"saying something\", I donrsquot mean art house pretension ndash I mean that a horror movie must resonate with its times.Horror is the most mutable of genres, apart from comedy. People have fallen in love for the same reasons since time immemorial, people have sought revenge for the same reasons since time immemorial, but jokes change from one day to the next. Horror also changes, not because what scares us changesbut because for horror to work it must relate to you and the fears of the time in which you live.Yoursquoll not be scared by Little Red Riding Hood, but centuries ago it terried your ancestors. Whats needed to scare modern viewers is something that echoes in our real lives ndash think of all those s B movies rfing off the unseen menace of reds under the bed like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or Cronenbergrsquos body-horror movies, like The Fly, driven by the fear of technology there was even a spate of post-s hippie horrors in the wake of the Manson family killings like Last House on the Left.Probably the two best examples of horror movies tapping into modern fears come in the shape of Eden Lake, and Ils . Eden Lake uses fear of the dispossessed to get its hooks into viewers. It makes the viewer wonderthe poor, the uneducated, the forgotten will one day rise up and kill them.This is the horror of the housing estate. It is a brutal take on what happens when the suburban middle classes rub up against the \"underclass\".Ils ndash Them ndash is similar in tone but here it is children who are the terror. It prods at the hidden adult fear that children could quite easily killthey wished. Wersquove seen terrible crimes committed by bored, abused, forgotten children unfold in our papers and on the TV news ndash this film seems to say,you beat a dog long enough it will bite you back, no matter how weak it is.Irsquom not trying to convince anyone that horror is art ndash though as a fan of horror movies, I do think the genre is capable of high art when at its very best.In a strange way, what horror can do is make you feel alive because it makes you confront death. Thatrsquos probably what I realised in my four-year-old mind back in the early s when Vincent Price scared the pants off me in The Masque of the Red Death.As the old toast goes from The Bride of Frankenstein: \"To a new world of Gods and Monsters!\""},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-mops-up-after-storm-callum","story":"Scotland is mopping up after Storm Callum, which brought heavy rain and flooding to swathes of the country.A Met Office yellow \"be aware\" alert for the south west of the country, the Lothians, Borders and Strathclyde areas was lted at midnight. Saturdayrsquos deluge came after a day of wet weather on Friday.Forecasters warned yesterday that homes and businesses could be flooded, causing damage to some buildings, while there is a chance of power cuts and loss of other services to some places.ldquoFast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to le, warned The Met Office.Wales and northwest England was also at risk of floods, with up to  mm of rain falling in some areas.ldquoFurther strong winds may bring down leaves and branches, increasing the likelihood of flooding due to blocked drains or culverts, the Met Office said.The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyissued two flood warnings, for the Upper Tay and Ballinluig to Logierait in Tayside. Lower level flood alerts were also in place for Dumfries and Galloway and the Borders.Sepas duty flooding manager David Faichney said yesterday the band of rain following Storm Callum would bring downpours of more than mm.He said: ldquoRivers are likely to risehellipI think there will be a lot of surface water. At this time of year, with leaves coming off the trees, drains tend to get blocked up... Flooding of roads, that will happen locally.\"Traffic Scotland urged motorists to drive with caution yesterday due to surface water on the roads. Flooding was reporting on section of the M.One motorist told the Herald on Sunday he saw a car lose control on the M near Glasgow, and hit the central reservation.ldquoI was travelling south from Forfar, said Alan Morrison. ldquoThe A was treacherous, with visibility poor and many drivers did not have their lights on. I saw a white BMW hit the central reservation on the M, about a mile from the junction with the M. There was a lot of standing water on the roads, with pools of water gathering in some places.On the transport network, some rail services were hit by delays, with the weather affecting the route between Preston and Scotland.Strong winds also saw speed restrictions imposed on many routes - with reduced Virgin services between London Euston, Birmingham New Street, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, Network Rail said.One of the worst affected areas in the UK was the village of Aberdulais in Neath Port Talbot where residents were ordered to evacuate their homes due to rising river levels amid reports of the worst floods there for  years.Meanwhile in the town of Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons national park, where the River Usk burst its banks, some properties were also flooded, with up to ft of water.High winds brought by Storm Callum delayed the start of fracking at a site in Lancashire.Work was expected to get under way at Preston New Road, Little Plumpton, near Blackpool on Saturday after an environmental campaigner failed in a High Court bid to block operations.But energy firm Cuadrilla said fracking had been postponed until Monday as the region felt the effects of Storm Callum.Meanwhile, fresh landslips on Friday caused by Storm Callum as it swept the west of Scotland will keep the Rest and be Thankful closed over the weekend.Heavy rain and strong winds brought  tonnes of debris from the hillside on to the A in Argyll and Bute on Friday as operators tried to clear landslips from earlier in the week.The closure has caused a ersion for motorists. Bear Scotland said work is continuing to repair the debris fencing, clear the carriageway and reinstate drainage.North west manager Eddie Ross said: ldquoStorm Callum is continuing to bring more heavy rain to the area, limiting visibility and making conditions dficult for the teams to progress repairs and the clear-up of yesterdays additional landslides.ldquoDespite this, teams are working exceptionally hard to do all they can to make the area safe, however until then the road and the Old Military Road local ersion has to remain closed for safety reasons.ldquoWere aware of the impact this is having on the busy weekend and holiday traffic and were doing all we can to help ensure the ersion route via the A at Dalmally keeps moving by having further safety patrols on the route to help any motorists as required."},{"url":null,"title":"future-shock-we-owe-david-icke-and-elon-musk-an-apology-if-quantum-experiment-proves-we-are-living-in-the-matrix","story":"ldquoThe universe is an illusion, the goalkeeper-turned-Messiah told an unconvinced Terry Wogan during a now legendary TV interview in . Icke ndash who preferred to be called ldquoSon of the Godhead at the time ndash had failed to ingratiate himself to the bemused host, perhaps regretfully kicking off the chat by informing Wogan that the moon was a hollow alien spaceship.Personal eccentricities aside,it turns out Icke was correct about whatrsquos now dubbed the ldquoSimulation Argument, we all owe him an apology. The turquoise shellsuit and mullet remain utterly unforgivable, of course.Although this increasingly popular theory was first mooted by Greek philosopher Plato in BC then sweetened for popular consumption by The Matrix, itrsquos Oxford academic Nick Bostromrsquos recent paper supporting the concept that has lent it some heavyweight credibility.Respected US astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson gives it ldquobetter than - odds that the simulation hypothesis is correct. ldquoI wish I could summon a strong argument against it, but I can find none, is his unsettling conclusion. Impish billionaire futurist Elon Musk has also mused ndash to a chorus of groans from Tesla shareholders ndash that wersquore ldquomost likely in a simulation. It must be noted, however, that Musk was recently filmed smoking a rather large cannabis joint.If the Simulation Argument is indeed accurate, it means everything we understand as empirical, objective reality ndash the entire universe ndash may actually have only sprung into existence a millisecond ago. Like someone firing up their Xbox for a shot of Assassinrsquos Creed. Our memories saved data, surroundings a hologram and bodies simply avatars, programmed to perceive a notion of forward-movement we call ldquotime. This serves to anchor our ldquothoughts and allows us a concept of ldquofuture for an illusionary sense of ldquoself.But breathe, itrsquos not all bad news ndash the theory allows for one possibility that accepts yoursquore actually real. In fact, it suggests you are actually all that exists within this particular articial reality and that everything in the universe is simply the creation of your mind.This rather egotistical belief system is known as solipsism and sceptics who are  percent convinced of their own existence should note there are no definitive philosophical rebuttals to the theory. Itrsquos certainly a tragedy I canrsquot convince you of my own existence, even when my picture appears right next to these words. If you are indeed the one who is dreaming all this up, please note Irsquod appreciate a less ridiculous hairdo.Soit turns out the entire universe is just an infinitely isible virtual reality where molecules are pixels, itrsquos likely our lives are simply some computer game played by alien children. And I suspect those who controlled the avatars of Leonardo da Vinci, Shakespeare and Prince used cheat codes.Compute the mind of GodIF any of these unsettling musings truly reflect reality, then this simulationrsquos coding for irony is certainly in need of a debug this week.Researchers from the University of Basque in Spain are currently embarking upon a new venture to reveal the true nature of the universe ndash using, yes, a computer. They do say it takes a thief to catch a thief.Itrsquos actually doubly ironic that it is shiny new ldquoquantum computers that are being used to ldquorecreate the origin of Darwinian evolution.This is because events in quantum physics have a truly inexplicable and weird way of being influenced by observation ndash like a tree in the woods only falling when someone can see it. Some scientists believe such oddness at the molecular level of reality may be an actual quirkinside our simulation.These Spanish researchers, however, are clearly aware of the potential irony of asking a computer to essentially explain and understand itself. ldquoWe leave open the question whether the origin of le is genuinely quantum mechanical, confirmed one of the scientists involved, rather cryptically.Perhaps itrsquos no coincidence New Yorker magazine recently reported two unnamed tech billionaires have employed a number of scientists to work out how to break them out of the simulation using quantum computers.QUANTUM OF SOLACESo whatrsquos so special about these quantum computers compared to that shiny new Macbook you only use for surfing the net and assimilating into societys higher social tiers  Well, the truth is even those who construct quantum computers dont really understand the dference. But they believe the chasm is seismic.Todayrsquos mass market machines compute using an internal binary language of s and s, while quantum machines also have a third potential state that lies, well hellip somewhere in between. Because of this, their computational units ndash known as quibits ndash have the special ability to become \"entangled\" with other quibits. After entering such a relationship, quibits will then instantly reflect any changes in its lsquotwinrsquo.Why does this weird lsquomirroring matter  Well, many particle physicists believe itrsquos an action that actually takes place outside of what we perceive as spacetime. This is because distance seems to be no barrier to quibitsrsquo instant communication. And now, were slowly learning how to harness this ability in order to create machines of almost infinite computing power. Simply, your Macs s and s are very slow and the timeless dimension in-between is not. Forget that thing Richard Pryor created in Superman , wersquore talking machines as powerful as the Transformersrsquo home planet of Cybertron.LOOKING FOR LUCAIT may be the case that quantum machines donrsquot discover a simulation at the root of reality, but actually confirm that Darwinian evolution all boils down to the mysterious ancient leform known as LUCA .What makes this great granny of all things especially fascinating is that it had the chance of eternal le ndash but decided to die so we could live. Just like Jesus four billion years later.Most evolutionary biologists are convinced that everything that has ever existed originates from LUCA, and a genetic portrait was recently created by evolutionary biologists at the Heinrich Heine University in Duumlsseldorf. Apparently this oddity existed in deep sea vents on the magma-drenched, celestial baby Earth and was unlike anything  that has ever existed ndash a spindling conglomeration of tiny cells that spent hundreds of millions of years simply chilling in the sea doing nothing. Blind, deaf yet perhaps not so dumb.Itrsquos notable that gender or death did not exist on Earth until LUCA unzipped itself to kick off evolution, shuffling around its genetics using some mysterious early form of osmosis.Why this organism died to unleash its essential ingredients and create all le on this planet remains a deep, abiding mystery. Or perhaps LUCA was simply an alien virus in our simulation, programmed to self-destruct and seed this virtual Earth with avatars. If so, the creators of this particular illusion are playing a very long game indeed.AND FINALLY hellipEXPANDING further upon Oxford philosopher Nick Bostromrsquos recent Simulation Theory paper, whatrsquos particularly striking is its casual assumption of many long-lived alien civilisations existing out there.If these beings run computer simulations ndash and they will, says Bostrom ndash then articial realities must be abundant throughout the universe. The problem is, these alien programmers would ndash like us ndash have no idea whether theyrsquore part of a simulation themselves. Every universe may simply be a Russian doll trapped within the darkness of another ndash an artical multiverse.Yet,we are indeed living in the root level of reality, perhaps our universal common ancestor LUCA was still a computer virus of sorts ndash one that sacriced its original form to set evolution in motion, hoping to gain a multi-dimentional perspective of reality through the eyes of everything that has ever lived and died on Earth.From the birds in the sky to fungus in the fields, LUCA is likely hiding in plain sight, with infinite perceptions of reality at its disposal to understand and conquer its planet completely.And when its greatest achievement ndash humans ndash finally blast off to the stars, the entire universe awaits."},{"url":null,"title":"hunt-goes-on-for-man-who-subjected-young-student-to-terrifying-ordeal","story":"This summer, on a Glasgow path overgrown by trees, a man first circled a woman and tried to lure her into some woods. Then he exposed himself and began masturbating.His victim, deeply distressed, escaped. So ndash at least for now ndash has he.That is because, weeks after his crime, the man remains at large. Police Scotland say they have ldquono positive line of inquiry, their way of saying they are not pursuing any specic leads. Their investigation, carried out by specialist public protection detectives, ldquoremains open.Officers do not doubt, insiders stress, the credibility and good faith of the victim and their only witness, a then -year-old student. She, however, does doubt them. So much so that in last weekrsquos Herald on Sunday the woman, Caitie Mackay, waived her anonymity to express her hurt and frustration about both the crime and the way she felt it was handled by the police. Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.Caitie said she had identied a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why  Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning dficulties.She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgowrsquos biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. ldquoTrying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless, Caitie said. ldquoI feel aswhat happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter ndash and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes ndash put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.So much so that some of their dferences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.Police, specically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitiersquos complaint ndash which is one of public indecency rather than ldquoa sexual assault, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.They also say there is ldquoinsufficient evidence to link the man with learning dficulties to the case.And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow isionrsquos team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.Bell said: ldquoFollowing a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July , officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.ldquoThe inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the ision, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identy a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that ldquoofficers were unsuccessful. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed ndash within serious legal limitations on what he can say ndash the concerns the Mackays had over the man identied by Caitie as her attacker.He said: ldquoOn July , the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identied by the victim as being the inidual who had carried out the public indecency. ldquoInquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was ed home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspectrsquos condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has signicant learning dficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramications of his actions or conduct.The man is on Police Scotlandrsquos vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.Bell added: ldquoThe inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Dfering perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly , such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In -, there were  cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrying ordeal on July . That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others. If you were one of those women, or have any information about who the man might be, contact Police Scotland."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-to-unveil-common-sense-brexit-plans","story":"The publication, due out on Monday, will reinforce the case for continued membership of the single market and customs union, Scotlands First Minister said.It will also argue that the UK Governments \" choice\" between a \"bad, possibly blindfold\" Brexit deal and a no-deal scenario should not be accepted.The release of the paper will come as the First Minister gives a speech at the Royal Society of Artsin London on Monday.Speaking in advance of the address, Ms Sturgeon said: \"The UK is scheduled to leave the European Union less than six months from now -

Around  per cent of the population is apparently on board when it comes to a greener, cleaner lestyle. Therersquos another  per cent at the other end of the spectrum, meanwhile, that doesnrsquot believe climate change is real.Then therersquos the big, woolly middle ndash thatrsquos me again ndash that accepts the science and understands the theoretical importance of these warnings, even tries to be a bit greener, but automatically switches off the full reality. Hence the ability to file last weekrsquos report into the ldquoI really should get round to that at some point part of the brain that also contains saving for a pension, eating healthily and doing more exercise. Or the ldquoIrsquom sure scientists will sort it place.Climate change is a million times more important than these issues, of course, and I find it fascinating that most of us didnrsquot collapse into a heap of anguish when we discovered the findings of this latest report. Despite how far we have evolved psychologically over the centuries, our ability to ignore serious issues because we donrsquot like the solutions remains remarkably strong.Living less mobile and connected lives, drastically reducing or giving up the conveniences that define our age ndash the dirty, gas-guzzling cars, the power-hungry gadgets, the cheap air travel, meat-heavy foods that fill our diets, the non-recyclable plastic ndash seems awful and impossible, so we ignore the whole thing.Even those of us already suffering the consequences of environmental destruction ndash those with breathing dficulties, for example ndash struggle to change their own behaviour because our brains are pre-conditioned to focus primarily on the short-term, and probably for very good reason.Human psychology has not evolved to point where it can handle the enormity of a challenge on this scale, evenscience can provide many of the intellectual and theoretical solutions. In other words, our tiny minds doom us to failure.And I include politicians in this ldquoour. Governments clearly have a very signicant role in making us change our behaviourthere is to be any hope of averting disaster. But which party will have the guts to write what would have to the most brutal and authoritarian manesto in British history  How would mere politicians persuade us to vote for this extremely distasteful medicine, evensomewhere deep down we know it is necessary How the biggest exercise in political persuasion would succeed at a time when governments, the media, scientists and ldquoexperts are less trusted and more despised than at any other point in living memory, and there is global ision on every front, only adds to the mind-boggling enormity of the task.I am horribly aware that this column contains not one practical idea for taking this vital issue forward. Irsquom not going to pretend I have any answers on this one. But it is important to acknowledge the simple and, letrsquos face it, understandable reasons why so many of us remain apathetic.Wersquore programmed to be this way because it means we will get out of bed even when things are at their most desperate.Right, on that note Irsquom off to watch the Strictly results show."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8814272.jpg?type=article-full","title":"could-barlinnie-have-served-its-time","story":"Thousands have passed through the Victorian halls of HMP Barlinnie through the decades, sentenced to wile away their days for high crimes and misdemeanours alike.But now speculation is mounting that the prisons last days may be coming, with reports that three sites have been identied as the potential home of its successor.For years a move to close Barlinnie has been in the works, with the The Herald reporting far back as  that property consultants had been engaged with a brief to find a place to house of new super prison to replace Scotlands largest jail.Now it appears that the process is close to an endgame, with only a final decision from the Scottish Government required to unleash the public funds needed to begin the process.It has been reported that the new building, dubbed HMP Glasgow, would cost around pound million and be based either within the city limits or just outside.:Is hard time about to get harder  The reality of Scotlandrsquos prison smoking banShould this come to pass, the old th century wings of Barlinnie, built to house criminals from Glasgow, would be sold off to the highest bidder, and may well be transformed into social housing or designer flats for well-to-do citydwellers.A spokesman for the Scottish Prison Service said at the weekend: ldquoThe Government have a surplus land disposal policy. In the first instance, we would have to offer the land to other parts of government to use it for other purposes.ldquoBarlinnie is a Victorian prison and in need of replacement.ldquoWersquove enjoyed unprecedented levels of investment in our prison estate in the last decade, which has seen us tackle a number of major priorities.ldquoBarlinnie remains one. Its replacement is in the government infrastructure plan. Wersquove been active in looking at a number of potential sites to relocate the prison.Executions were once announced with a notice on the prisons doorSuch a switch would be a surreal twist in the history of Barlinnie, known to Glaswegians as the Big Hoose or the Bar-L.Opened in , it was envisaged as an enlightened effort to reform the brutal penal policy Victorians were familiar with.Many were put to work - with baking, basket-weaving, carpentry, shoemaking all jobs done by prisoners, as was breaking the sandstone at a nearby quarry for the further halls which would take the prison up to capacity.:Nurse at Barlinnie warns of lots of drugs errors and dangerous night-staff ratio#Now cracked and blackened with age, the stone walls of Barlinnie grew to house a notional , souls but would see the population swell to almost twice that as time went by.Stories abound about the dangerous overcrowding within, with prisoners crammed on top of each other in cells two metres wide by three and a half long designed for single occupancy.Today is is home to around , prisoners, and conditions have approved. In , after years of criticism and warnings over human rights, prison bosses were able to end the practice of slopping out, where inmates had to keep chamber pots in the cells overnight and empty them in the morning.The Special Unit helped rehabilitate some of the worst offendersBut Barlinnie retains dark secrets. While designed to rehabilitate wrongdoers, in  it became the last home some of its inhabitants would ever see when it became a place of execution.Between then and , when the publics attitude to capital punishment hardened, ten men were put to death in Barlinnies hanging shed, their bodied taken from the noose and placed on a mortuary slab in a chamber below.:The art that changed the men in Barlinnie#The last man to die in the hangmans noose was barely a man at all.

In  it became the site of Scotlands longest-running prison siege, when inmates took over the jail.A warden was paraded on the rooftop with a kne at his throat, as angry inmates demanded an end to what they said was the brutality of some staff members.Mr Mandela at the jailNelsom Mandela famously visited the prison in , and it was also home to Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing.Both of those men have passed on now, leaving their names to history.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.John PrebbleIn Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present. The man with the girl, he says, was the ldquoantithesis of a responsible adult.Highland Herald: Reporting The News From The North is published on Wednesday by Birlinn ."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-staying-in-customs-unionsingle-market-common-sense-approach","story":"The First Minister argued that the take-it-or-leave-it Brexit deal Theresa May was offering was not credible there were alternatives to her unworkable Chequers Plan.ldquoThey are threatening us with fire to try to make us choose the frying pan but MPs do not have to fall for that  choice. Indeed, I would argue that no self-respecting Parliament would fall for it, she declared.In a speech to the Royal Society of Arts, the social change think-tank, in London, Ms Sturgeon complained that the Conservative Government had shown ldquolittle inclination to pay heed to Scotland during the Brexit process.ldquoOne of the lessons from our experience of the last two years, which I suspect has not been lost on the Scottish people and which will be remembered in Scotland for a long time to come, is the stark contrast between the EUrsquos treatment of independent nations and the UKrsquos treatment of devolved nations.Claiming the UK had ldquodismissed and ignored Scotlandrsquos concerns, the FM noted: ldquoLooking at the UK and the EU, it is fair to say that only one has looked like a genuine partnership of equals and that has not been the UK.Ms Sturgeon stressed how her Government had made a ldquobig compromise by dropping its demand that Scotland remain in the EU and pledged it to exhausting all the ldquoopportunities for compromise, holding out hope that a sensible outcome could be achieved. However, she made clear Scotland staying in the customs union and single market was Edinburghrsquos ldquobottom line.She pointed out thatthere were a special carve-out on the single market for Northern Ireland, then Scotland should be next in line for a ldquodferentiated approach.The FM only fleetingly mentioned the option of a second independence referendum, saying howno compromise could be reached, then Scotland ldquomust have the option to choose a dferent course ie independence.In a question and answer session following her speech, she claimed the ldquocase for democratic independence since  has strengthened immeasurably, noting how in the referendum campaign it was argued a Yes vote would result in Scotland leaving the EU.ldquoThat brings into sharp focus the democratic deficit Scotland has experienced on many occasions, which on this issue it has felt particularly harshly, she said.The Nationalist leader dismissed the Prime Ministerrsquos compromise blueprint as ldquoimpracticable, undesirable and undeliverable, stressing that whatever proposalMPs might finally vote on, it would not be the Chequers Plan.She noted how the EU was bitterly opposed to Chequers becauseit would undermine the unity of the single market, dealing only with goods and not services. Plus, there was no Westminstermajority for it.Ms Sturgeon rebuffed Mrs Mayrsquos claim that it was the only option on the table this was so, the FM pointed out, because the PM refused to countenance any other.ldquoLetrsquos be clear, she declared, ldquoa head-in-the-sand approach wonrsquot make the Chequers ostrich fly.The SNP leaderinsisted that neither a fudged Brexit deal not a ldquoblindfold Brexit ie a vague political statement of intent about the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU, would do. A blindfold Brexit would ldquoreplace a no-deal Brexit with a no-detail Brexit, she said.ldquoVoting against a bad or a blindfold Brexit deal isnrsquot a vote for no-deal it would be a vote for a better deal, insisted Ms Sturgeon.The FM accused the Conservative Government of taking an ldquoextreme interpretation of the  referendum result, which, she argued, was not a mandate for a hard Brexit and that the ldquoobvious democratic compromise was for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union.Indeed, Ms Sturgeon went on to say that her preferred option ldquomight well be the only option which is not completely impossible.She explained: ldquoIt should be acceptable to the EU. It avoids the worst economic damage that Brexit will wreak. It resolves the Irish border issue and it comes closest to reconciling the dfering views of Leavers and Remainers. And while it is an outcome, which still looks some distance away, it is not unachievable.The FM called for a genuine attempt to find common ground, stressing how the Scottish Government had shown its willingness to compromise, ldquoit is time the UK Government did likewise.In response, aspokesman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said: \"We will have an ambitious course outside of the EU that enhances our prosperity and security and that genuinely works for everyone across the UK.\"We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU and look forward to continuing to engage with the EU Commission on our proposals.\"Adam Tomkins, theScottish Conservative Constitution spokesman,said there was \"nothing new\" in Ms Sturgeons speech, which had been made \"in the hope of drumming up the prospects for Scottish independence\".He added: \"If the SNP doesnt back a deal, it is automatically supporting a no-deal scenariosomething the Nationalists have admitted would be bad for Scotland.\"And, of course, they dont careoutcomes are bad for Scotland, so long as theyre good for the prospects of another independence referendum.\"Labours Ian Murray, who co-chairs Scottish Labour for the Single Market, said:ldquoThere is no such thing as a good Brexitand the First Minister is right to state that UK membership of the single market and the customs union is the least-worst option for our economy.ldquoGiven the problems with solving the border issue in Ireland, this is the only practical solution. It will also safeguard up to , jobs in Scotland.ldquoHowever, the SNP must not use the Brexit chaos to pursue its dream of breaking-up Britain. Nicola Sturgeons suggestion of a dferential deal for Scotland would move the Northern Irish problem to the border between Scotland and England. You cant solve one problem by creating another - but we know this is part of the SNPs drive for independence.ldquoVoters donrsquot want political game-playing from either the Tories or the SNP they want this Brexit disaster to be dealt with, added the Edinburgh MP."},{"url":null,"title":"activists-bypass-sturgeon-on-new-indyref2-campaign","story":"The cross-party Scottish Independence Conventionannounced a fundraising appeal on Monday for a fresh organisation aimed at driving support for a Yes vote over %.If the appeal is successful, the new body will provide ldquofront-foot media handling, strategic support, resources, messaging and the administrative capacity to help persuade No voters.It will also bypass SNP ministers to ldquodevelop strategy, undertake public opinion research, and develop ldquomessages and campaign materials for the movement.The move could potentially sow confusion over key issues such as the economy and currency, as the SNP leadership is firmly wedded to its controversial Growth Commission blueprint for independence.The announcement comes less than a week after the First Minister downplayed the prospect of a second independence referendum before the  Holyrood election.Although she said Brexit had strengthened the case for independence, she also said SNP members must wait ldquoimpatiently and show ldquopragmatism, perseverance and patience.However others at last weekrsquos SNP conference wanted a quicker pace, with SNP MP Angus MacNeil saying the best chance of independence was ldquohere and now.The proposed campaign vehicle is also a tacit repudiation of Yes Scotland, the main outfit used to promote a Yes vote at the  referendum.Ostensibly cross-party, in reality it was dominated by SNP money and personnel, leading to tensions with the Green and Socialist arms of the Yes movement.Yes Scotland Ltd remains a mothballed company under the control of an SNP lawyer.The Scottish Independence Conventionsaid funds raised through the Thisisit.scot website would be used to push support for a Yes vote ldquoconsistently beyond % in the polls.It said the new campaign vehicle would help coordinate grassroots activity and liaise with the media, including providing a ldquorebuttal service.Like Yes Scotland, which needed an pound, bail-out from the SNP in , the new organisation is supposed to raise funds and become financially ldquoself-sustaining.The SIC is an umbrella body made of pro-independence groups and parties, including the SNP, Scottish Greens, Scottish Socialists and the Radical Independence Campaign.SIC convenor Elaine C Smith said: ldquoThe dream of Independence for Scotland has been kept alive by all the ious groups who keep working, campaigning and marching.ldquoNow wersquod like to get an official campaign up and running to allow us to help organise further.ldquoAt almost every meeting or event I have attended over the past four years I have been bowled over by the self-organising and work that is going on across the country.ldquoHowever I am always asked about a central resource that can distribute and communicate whatrsquos going on with all the other groups.

The SNPs own Growth Commission admits that independence means years of cuts to public services.\"Pamela Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, added: ldquoThe nationalist movement will never stop campaigning for a second independence referendum, even though the majority of people in Scotland want to move on from the isions of the past.

Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK. It works to reduce baby deaths through promoting better maternity care and funding research. The charity offers training and comprehensive bereavement support, both nationally through its helpline –    or via email at helpline@sands.org.uk – and locally via some  regional support groups.Further information can be found at www.sands.org.uk."},{"url":null,"title":"jordan joins meldrum house","story":"A new general manager has been appointed at the award-winning Meldrum House Country Hotel and Golf Course.Jordan Charles, who trained as a lawyer at Stirling and Strathclyde Universities, joins the hotel from Telford Hotel and Golf Resort where he was deputy manager.The -year-old has worked in the hospitality industry since he was at school.After graduating, Charlesworked his way up the ranksthrough ious roles at Q Hotels and the newly rebranded RBH Hotel Group and he said he is delighted to be joining the prestigious Meldrum House for his first general manager’s role.CEO at Meldrum House, Andy Burgess commented “Jordan’s strong track record in the golf and spa hotel sector will stand him in good stead for this exciting and challenging position.“We’ve got a great team working at Meldrum House and Jordan is well placed to continue to grow the business.”In his new role, Charles will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the  bedroomed hotel and golf course which is set in -acres of Aberdeenshire countryside.Commenting on his new role Jordan said: “I am excited by the challenge ahead and look forward to leading one of Scotland’s finest luxury hotels.“I’ve been working in hotels in England for the last  and a half years and I’m looking forward to be heading back to Scotland and ensuring that the high standards at Meldrum House continue.”data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"A time to heal...Sands has offered bereavement care across the UK since it was founded  years ago by two bereaved mums who discovered there was no support available to them.\"  A time for bereaved Scottish parents to remember viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"ne charity marks 30 years","story":"A charity which supports adults with learning disabilities and additional support needs in Inverurie has kicked off a year of celebrations to mark its th anniversary.Aberdeen-headquartered Inspire started le as Partnership Housing in  then became Partnership before adopting its current name in .Service provision began in  when three people moved from Aberdeen’s Woodlands Hospital into their new home in the city’s Fonthill Terrace.Now more than  adults are supported thanks to a range of initiatives in Aberdeen City, Aberdeenshire, Moray and Angus.Locally, the charity supports  people at St James’s Court and operates Inspire Soaps, a day service where iniduals have the opportunity to make soaps, candles, arts and crafts.To mark the start of its th birthday celebrations, Inspire recently held a special birthday party for corporate supporters, long serving staff and local authority representatives in Inverurie.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future. Mr Moir agreed to take these up with his colleagues responsible for land ambulance provision. Hopefully this may enable greater resilience to be built into the service going forward.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, creating this blueprint for the town will help the council and community work together to achieve as much as we can.”The council is now working to help community groups to find external grant funding to bring forward their ideas.To read the full document and for updates visitwww.yourkirkwall and the Your Kirkwall Facebook and Twitter feeds.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

I see a bright future for the town, now things are starting to move forward,\" she said.This was echoed by long-serving Invergordon hairdresser Sharon Mitchell.

It also can help people buy a new-build home from a council or housing association.Ms Mitchell said: \"A LIFT scheme would be the best.

These were the northern end of the Cromlet site, opposite the rugby club and the farmland at Davidson Drive, surrounding the farm buildings.\"Both landowners were approached and the latter is under discussion.\"She added: \"Invergordon has so much to offer in terms of employment, both atthe base and industrial estates, as well as the cruise sector, which is growing, but people need a decent roof over their heads.\"By encouraging inward-migration and moving around within the town we also encourage the economics to grow, so more people means more people in the town shopping and more new shopping ideas popping up as there would be people to use them.\"In latter years, Invergordonrsquos population has settled around the  mark, whereas Alness has grown to just over .\"It is time this balanced-out and allowed both towns to be more equal in terms of shopping experiences.\"Monday  Oct  : PMBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact.

Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"11 greenwell gott ","story":"Offers over £,This exclusive development comprises thirteen houses grouped around a large communal park which provides a great play area for children being on a no-through road.

Added to this, a further four football pitches worth of the reserve land would be temporarily lost to the construction site to accommodate the construction activities and the associated diggers, cranes and other heavy machinery.\"But the effects of the road scheme on the reserves wildle will extend far beyond the extent of roadworks activities.\"The noise and activity associated with the A construction works, and the increased traffic flows and the imposing road structure once the road is completed, will cause many birds to keep their distance and not attempt to nest or feed within several hundred metres of the road site.\"Transport Scotland has bought land at Dellmore near Insh Marshes and proposes to convert some of this to wet grassland to accommodate the homeless wader bird species from Insh. While RSPB Scotland has welcomed this, the charity said it will be hard to convert this land for the waders, and maintain it as such over the long-term.The spokeswoman said: \"It is far from guaranteed it will provide suitable habitat, and evenit does, the new habitat will not be big enough or suitable to rehome all of the waders that would be made homeless. Neither will it address other harm to wildle.\"Karen Birkby, RSPB Scotlands site manager at Insh Marshes, said several suggestions made to Transport Scotland to minimise impact on the nature reserve have been ignored.Aviemore Community Council made similar claims last week that their concerns had fallen on stoney ground over plans to construction the dual carriageway on the village side of the current A as part of the Dalraddy-Slochd section. They said it will impact on the popular Milton Woods.Ms Birkby said: \"We have continually made the case for protecting the exceptional wildle of Insh Marshes, minimising harmful impacts, and maximising environmental benefits such as enhancing or providing suitable new habitat nearby.\"While we welcome the intention of converting some land at Dellmore to wet grassland, it is far from guaranteed that it will provide suitable habitat for all the wildle affected.\"We understand the need for the A dualling but believe that it can be built in a way which minimises its impact.\"We have suggested several ways in which Transport Scotland could do this but disappointingly, they are not proposing these measures in the latest plans, so there is a real risk that the road scheme will result in long-term harm to a iety of wildle.\"We encourage local people to view the proposals online or attend the public exhibition and raise their concerns before the deadline of October .\"The proposals for Crubenmore to Kincraig went on show yesterday in Newtonmore Village Hall.

Afterward, I travelled back home and got out the car and I don’t remember anything about the three weeks after that – but apparently I ‘died’ a couple of times, according to reports!“I was told that I dropped like a stone on the pavement outside my house, and my neighbour ran across to the community centre to get the defibrillator and used it on me. After that, the doctor and the air ambulance arrived.”Cherill spent three weeks in Raigmore Hospital in Inverness but was then admitted to hospital in Edinburgh where she went through open heart surgery and was fitted with a pacemaker. After three weeks out of the hospital, she was readmitted to Raigmore for a further two weeks but is now back home recovering.Having battled her way back from the brink, Cherill was informed that her husband Russell had died at home in Gairloch two weeks to the day of her suffering cardiac arrest. “It’s heart-breaking,” she said. “I think what happened to me must have been terrying for poor Russell.”Despite enduring such serious illness and personal tragedy, Cherill remains positive about the future and was quick to pay tribute to the role of LuckyBhere. She said: “I am so pleased to see a small organisation like LuckyBhere is doing so well. I wouldn’t be hereit wasn’t for the defibrillator at the community centre and someone being able to use it on me.”Three days after Cherill’s collapse, on Tuesday th June, -year-old father-of-three Ian MacLeod was out at Dores beach when he too suffered a cardiac arrest.“I’m a cub scout leader and was doing the register with another leader when I hit the dirt,” he said.“A couple of Spanish tourists who were on the beach at the time performed CPR on me and got the defib from the Dores Inn and kept on going until the ambulance arrived. It took  to  minutes to get me to Raigmore Hospital.”After being admitted on Tuesday evening, Ian was fitted with a ‘stent’the next day and was out of the hospital on Thursday to pick his children up from school.Having served in the forces and kept himself in good psychical the condition, Ian believed there was no rhyme nor reason for his illness: “I have never been overweight and I’m in decent shape, so it just shows you it could happen to anyone.”During his  years as a security guard in the Eastgate Shopping Centre in Inverness, Ian was on the other end of a defibrillator — having used one at work — and was keen to stress that when it comes to using the device there shouldn’t be anything to fear. “You can’t do any more harm to a person by using a defib, as they are in effect already dead. “I am forever grateful. All things considered, I could have died and there would be three kids left without a dad.”On Wednesday th June, in Port of Ness in Lewis, -year-old John Burgis wasn’t feeling his usual self and his we Carol soon became concerned about his wellbeing.“John hadn’t been  per cent the day before, which rang alarm bells for me,” she said. “He had been a bit breathless, and we went to the surgery. They took his blood pressure and said he was fine but — given he was  — to take it easy, so we came home# We went to bed about  o’clock.”“I don’t remember anything apart from waking up in the hospital,” said John. “Carol apparently found me making funny noises at about one o’clock in the morning and then realised I was unconscious.”Carol quickly called for an ambulance: “I dialled  and when I was on the phone he stopped breathing. Then I did what I was told to do – I got him off the bed and on to the floor and did CPR until the responder arrived.“Fiona, the responder alongside whom I had trained about  years earlier came from Cross with the defibrillator – it was lucky she was the one on call and didn’t live far away. She got the kit out straight away. I put the stickers on his chest, she shocked him, and he started breathing again.”John was admitted to hospital in Stornoway before being transferred by helicopter to Queen Elizabeth ICU in Glasgow. He was then admitted to the Golden Jubilee Hospital in Clydebank where he was fitted with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . He was back home just over a week later.“One reason for my quick recovery was that I actually went into hospital quite fit,” said John. “Even though I was unconscious, my body itself was in a fit state. We had regularly been going to the gym near our house here which has a scheme free for pensioners that is great – it encourages some of the old folk to go. We regularly go out on our bikes or walk up to the Butt of Lewis, so we do lead quite active lestyles.”Carol added: “It was our wedding anniversary recently which was very poignant as I could have been sitting here by myself – I wasn’t, and it’s all good.“We have a very strong faith and that has helped us accept what has happened and be extremely grateful that John is still here.”Dr. Steve Leslie, consultant cardiologist and clinical lead for heart failure at Raigmore Hospital, believes the work undertaken by LuckyBhere is “truly le-saving”.“Without defibrillation, a cardiac arrest is almost always fatal,” Dr. Leslie said. “For every  seconds in which defibrillation is delayed the chance of success is reduced by  per cent. This means that for defibrillation to be successful it needs to be delivered as soon as possible. CPR prior to defibrillation can buy time.#The approach taken by LuckyBhere to encourage communities not only to provide community-based defibrillators but also to engage with training is lesaving.”Established in , LuckyBhere was set-up by Skye resident Ross Cowie who suffered a cardiac arrest in  but was saved due to the presence nearby of an ambulance which had lesaving equipment.In view of his own experience, Ross decided to raise funds to purchase a defibrillator for the Skye Camanachd shinty clubhouse in Portree which was where he fell ill. What began as a small local gesture has since blossomed into a national charity – LuckyBhere and its team of volunteers have provided training to thousands of people in communities across theand breadth of Scotland, from Cullivoe Hall in Shetland to Burrowhead Holiday Village near the Mull of Galloway.Last year the charity linked up with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to provide ELS training — including how to operate a defibrillator — as part of the curriculum in all  primary and secondary schools across the Western Isles. In total, there are currently  public access defibrillators in the Western Isles from the Butt of Lewis to Barra, and more than  across Skye.Ross Cowie said: “We always said at LuckyBhere thatwe could help to save one le that would make all efforts worthwhile. Several people have survived but, for three to be saved in five days, is extraordinary.“Much of this success is due to the trainers who give their time freely to train thousands of people across Scotland in lesaving skills. Training takes only two hours and what better skill could be learned than the ability potentially to save someone’s le.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/IMG_20180804_190022_01.jpg","title":"mallaig and kyleakin prepare for championship","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLeague newcomers Mallaig face reigning champions Kyleakin in Broadford on Saturdaywith the  Skye and Lochalsh Football League Championship at stake.This season#s champions will be determined by virtue of a winner-takes-all, title-deciding playoff after both sides finished neck-a-neck on  points in the table # as goal dference isn#t factored in.Mallaig secured their place in tomorrow#s showdown after recording a fantastic - away victory against Sleat and Strath in the final game of the campaign in which their goalkeeper Mark Johnston pulled off a late penalty save to seal the victory.Kyleakin, meanwhile, took the spoils with a well-deserved - home win in their crunch match against fellow title contenders Portree Juniors thanks in part to a splendid showing by goalkeeper Craig Wilson.With the teams having scored  goals between them in the league this season # *including  in their three encounters so far, Saturday#s match-up promises to be a fitting finale to what has been a thrilling and unpredictable campaign.Having gone from - up to - down, the Blues rallied with goals from substitute Brett MacMillan, who drew his side level and then from Andy Cunningham who struck a late winner to seal the points.Mallaig led twice, first through Marc MacLean, and then Angus MacNaughton but were pegged by Graham Campbell#s side.Just as it appeared a vital three points would slip through the net, Jamie MacGregor# side struck a third in injury time as Ryan MacDonald set up Andy Cunningham for the winner.With only a win guaranteed to keep them in the hunt, Mallaig stepped up when the pressure was on to put in an excellent away performance against DL MacKinnon#s men.Ross Douglas scored a brace to help fire his side - ahead but Connaire Yoxon found the back of the net with a fine finish to halve their advantage.With less than ten minutes remaining Sleat were awarded a penalty and the chance to equalise. However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game. We really need to work out a game plan to unlock the Kyleakin code, they are the only team we haven’t managed to beat this year.#########################################-Article by Adam GordonAll images by Willie Urquhart."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/STROMEFERRY-ROAD-TO-RAIL-4.jpg","title":"council wants scotrail to help ease disruption on stromeferry","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineScotrail are currently considering a proposal to terminate rail journeys at Strathcarron to allow road traffic to flow more freely through the ersion on the Stromeferry bypass.At a meeting in Lochcarron last week, Colin Howell , Highland Council’s head of infrastructure, said that the ‘road to rail’ ersion on the bypass, where important stabilisation work to the rockface is being carried out, could stay open to traffic for an extra  minutes each dayScotrail would agree to do this. It would involved taking passengers by bus from Strathcarron to stations along the line to Kyle of Lochalsh.At the moment, even when a train has gone passed the bypass, that section of line must remain closed until the train reaches either Kyle or Strathcarron.

A number of mistakes from both the rail company and Highland Council have led to the situation that we are in now and have been for some time.”“Network Rail must stop some of the trains coming from Inverness at Strathcarron and then arrange a bus service going onto Stromeferry.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society.

Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8669231.1539604789!/image/image.jpg","title":"closing date for psni applications fast approaching","story":"The closing date for applications to join the PSNI is fast approaching.The closing date is this Friday October  at noon.

Angela and John with some of the trophies Angela Jeffers, , a technology and design technician at Hazelwood Integrated College, and her husband John, , operations trainer at Belfast International Airport, started as casual dancers but in the past few years have stepped up to competition level.This summer they were the sole representatives from NI to take part in the Dance Promoters Association’s showpiece in Bournemouth where they were crowned Closed UK Champions in the Over  Beginners category. They also picked up third place in the Over s Novice bracket.Angela, who is originally from Ashton-under-Lyne near Manchester, said: “We’re both kept very busy with our jobs but we’ve our weekends free to devote to dancing. We fly over to Liverpool on a Friday night for a lesson for two hours, have a competition on the Sunday and then fly home on Monday morning and go straight back into work.”Along with her husband John who comes from Crumlin, they have picked up an impressive haul of trophies with the prizes they received at the Bournemouth Summer Festival taking pride of place.   Angela and John Jeffers in action “We were up against so many good dancers,” said Angela. “We were astounded to finish with a first and a third place.”She added: “We started dancing lessons just after we got married, so that’s about  years ago, but the competitions we’ve been doing for less than three years.“It never even occurred to us to take lessons before we got married for the first dance. We got married in a very small castle hotel near Edinburgh. We didn’t have a disco anyway, we had a magician instead.”Askedthe dance competitions the pair took part in looked in any way like Strictly Come Dancing, Angela said: “I always worry that all people see of dancing is Strictly. That’s more like show dancing.    Angela and John Jeffers “Competition dancing is not like Strictly whatsover. Our routines are based on trying to get the footwork correct, the timing, the posture.“People think they’re going to see us throwing each other around over our heads. What we do is proper dancing.“For example, to go through the steps of the foxtrot is not dficult, it’s making it look like a foxtrot that is the skill. If someone is dancing and you’re watching them through a window, would you know what dance they are doing  Most times it just looks like they’re walking around the room.”Police investigating link between Ballymena break-ins Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"She added: “In Strictly when you see the smoke on the floor, they’re hiding their feet. The amount of time they spend out of hold, floating about wasting time, that wouldn’t happen in a proper competition.   John and Angela dressed for their appearance in Lost City of Z “I think people who watch Strictly will end up having an unrealistic expectation about dancing. They think you can learn to dance in a week. If we all had a professional training us for  hours a day maybe we could.“It takes a lot longer when you’re only doing one lesson a week which is closer to the norm because of time and money. We go three times a week, maybe spend about five or six hours practising, but that’s because we’re in competitions.”Detailing how they began dancing, Angela said: “It was something that I always wanted to do. We saw this advertisement in a shop in Randalstown for Bob Lindsay’s social dancing class.“My husband started as a reluctant dancer, he really only did it for me. Although he does enjoy it a lot more now.”The pair moved on to Clarke’s Dance Studios in Belfast before getting tuition from Paul Taylor, a professional dancer from Liverpool.Angela said: “I remember being a bag of nerves before our first competition in England. But as we stepped up our lessons our technique, footwork and timing improved. As we did more competitions we started getting a few firsts.“Sadly there aren’t really any competitions in Northern Ireland so mostly we go to England or down to Ireland.“You don’t really do it for the prizes, it’s for personal achievement. We’re all in it together. You get quite friendly with the people you’re dancing against. It can be emotionally draining.”More than being just a hobby that fills their weekends, the couple’s dancing has proved important for John’s health.Angela said: “John had le saving heart surgery seven years ago. He had an aortic aneurism and calcied aortic valve.“He had both replaced in a seven hour operation, at the Royal and was back dancing – gently – after four weeks. “He used the dancing to help rebuild his strength and fitness.” On October , Angela and John will be reunited with their first dance teacher Bob Lindsay for a demonstration in Ballyclare Town Hall.Through their dancing the couple ended up in the feature film ‘Lost City of Z’ in a ballroom scene.John has also appeared on television in an episode of Countryfile looking at the hare population at Belfast International Airport where he works.try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1077173.jpg--.jpg?1539084908000\n","title":"public mystified by disappearing planters","story":"LOCAL people have been mystied as to why the large street planters, bought at considerable cost to ratepayers, have vanished from the Ballymena townscap.Many members of the public have been contacting theto enquire what has happened the planters and whether they willto the streets.The large containers, which were added to the town centre as part of the poundmillion public realm scheme were initially the subject of public scorn but by early June many of them had been filled with blooms, adding some colour and vibrant appearance to the town.So, when the best of the planters with superb floral displays were taken away, virtually overnight, many locals were puzzled.However it must be admitted that some of the planters - originally dubbed ‘skips’ by local people, were in a poor state or repair.When thecontacted the Council to askthey were gone for good, they responded by saying the planters had been taken to a Council yard to be replanted, but will be ed to the town centre when this is complete.Eagle-eyed members of the public have also been asking why the planters had been moved from the original storage area at the site of the old Wellington Street church.

A mother and grandmother, Cindy, who was just , has been described as an ‘inspirational’ figure both to her family, friends and those she mentored.   Cindy Greer Her son Aaron Greersaid: “My mum was the rock of the family. We all depended on her. “I think we all feel a bit lost right now. To have the person you have always depended upon taken away from you so suddenly, it is dficult to deal with. “She was the most amazing, inspirational person in my le. It is so hard to put into words what she meant to us. “This was always a happy house. I have such good memories because of mum. She brought all of us together. She has two grandchildren and loved them to pieces. The family was mum’s big love. Any excuse for a family gathering to bring us all together. Christmas dinner was always here with everyone around the table.”Her mum Joan Newell is simply heartbroken. She said she couldn’t imagine never seeing her eldest daughter Cindy again. “I just love her so much. She was always there for me and did whatever she could to make my le better.“She was such a rock in this family. She phoned me last Wednesday after she had been talking to Alan. I asked herwe would see her that night but she had a client coming and she would see me on Thursday afternoon. That was the last we spoke.“I was at a meeting in church on Wednesday night and a couple of people came in late and said there had been a terrible accident. I said ‘God help whoever it is’. Little did I know it was Cindy. I couldn’t take it in when I heard the news.”Her partner of  years Alan McIvor said she was coming from work last Wednesday and phoned him on her hands-free around pm to say she was leaving. “She asked how my day was and she was her usual cheery self.“She said to put the tea on, and I reckoned she would be home about .pm. Sadly she didn’t make it.”Her red Honda Civic had been involved in a collision with a van at around .pm.“Someone stopped at the scene and started CPR then Cindy was resuscitated by paramedics.

But the worst thing for a child is to lose a mother. There are no words good enough to describe the person my Mummy is or how I feel at this present moment. Even though her fabulous personality shone throughout every part of her and her le, I am going to miss the simple things like goodnight kisses, the constant ‘I love you millions my special girl’ and the hour long chats about our dreams. I am so so privileged to call her my mother and she made sure she gave all of us the most heart-warming special memories that will stay with us a letime.“Her smile, her laugh, her humour, her love will always be with me. I love you millions forever Mum.”Cindy’s sister Julie Newell said she was  years younger than her and for many years took on a motherly role. “That grew into a friendship, sister relationship which was amazing. She was my biggest support. She is the heart of this family. She was the boss as the oldest sister. She took all the decisions for mum and dad as their health isn’t great.”Cindy and her partner Alan had been together for  loving years. Alan firmly believes Cindy made him a better man. “She was a total and utter inspiration and has improved my le. She was just what I needed.“We met when we both worked for the First Trust Bank, although in dferent departments. We enjoyed such brilliant times together - so many things, holidays and weekends away that I have great memories of.“Over the last few days people have said to me that Cindy and I did more in the last  years than a lot of people have done in a letime.“We had outline plans for Cindy’s th birthday in a year and a half and that is something I will have to deal with.“It is absolutely devastating. She was my rock and inspiration to be a better person.” Cindy grew up in Gilford’s Barrack Hill and went to Craigavon Primary School in the town and on to Tandragee Junior High School. She then went to Banbridge Tech.Straight after school she joined the TSB Bank in Lisburn in  later moving to the Lurgan branch.

Yet, Ciaran Johnston had the final say on proceedings to nail a free under intense pressure and in the face of a strong cross-field wind. As the underdogs, some may feel that St John’s had their chance the first day as favourites have a habit of winning replays. However, St John’s manager Tony McNulty sees it dferently and has urged his side to make to most of Sunday’s second chance to reach the county final. “We just took our foot of the pedal in the last few minutes. I said before the game that we had to play for  or  minutes and we only played for  minutes,” said McNulty. “We were four or five points ahead late on and we just switched off. “We switched off long enough for them to get their goal and it was nervous at the end. While we scored to draw the game, we felt we had done enough to win the game. “We’ll not be going into this match thinking we’ve missed the boat. “When Neil McManus hit that free I though “here we go again” – thankfully Ciaran Johnston stepped up and scored his free. We were disappointed having led not to hold on.“We can’t afford to switch off again – Cushendall are too good. When you have players like Neil McManus, Arron Graffin and Alex Delargy, we can’t afford to. I can’t see there being much in the game again this Sunday.” McNulty also gave his views on the worrying scenes which marred the end of the match when two Cushendall supporters jumped over the wire at Dunloy to confront the St John’s players in the dying minutes of the game. With such incidents in the spotlight in recent weeks, the intruders could have sparked a much more serious flashpoint, but order was soon restored. While McNulty condemned the actions of those involved, he feared the game might have been brought to a premature end with his side one point in arrears at the time. “There was a bit of carryon at the sideline which had nothing to do with us,” reflected McNulty “The ball was in among four or five Cushendall men and one of their players pulled on it.“He hit his own player and one of our players. It resulted in a bit of pushing – nothing serious. “Two of their supporters jumped over the wire. “I don’t know why, but they started throwing punches until the players got them off the pitch. “I was glad the referee continued the game and gave us the chance to equalise and thankfully the people were identied.” It is believed that the Cushendall player who was struck by his own teammate was Antrim ace Eoghan Campbell, who is likely to miss Sunday’s replay as a result of the hand injury sustained late in the drawn encounter. St John’s will also be without one of their leading players for the remainder of the campaign after attacker Donal Carson departed for Australia last week, but Simon McCrory is expected to be fit to play a greater role in the replay having played the second half in the drawn game. “Donalis away to Australia so that’s a big blow for us,” added McNulty. “I don’t know what happened, but there was something about the dates and he couldn’t get them changed. “It is unfortunate because he has been playing well for us. “In nearly every game, he has scored a goal for us. If Campbell is out for them, it evens things up a bit. “Simon McCrory should be good to go. He is a super player for us and he has been outstanding in every game he has played this year. He wasn’t right for the last game. All being well, the two-week break will do him good.” McNulty will also have the task of lting the dual players in the club following their semi-final football defeat at the hands of Creggan last Sunday. Senior finalists in , the Johnnies were edged out - to - by Kevin Madden’s men at Glenavy, but McNulty, whose son Ryan is a key member of both squads, doesn’t think the dual players will suffer any hangover from that defeat. “We are disappointed, but we have to hang in,” stated the Johnnies boss. “We didn’t play as well as we can do on Sunday, so we can have no complaints. “Things conspired against us on the day. Simon McDonagh’s we went into labour on Sunday morning so he was unavailable. Peter McCallin wasn’t back from holiday in time. “We had six or seven dual players in action on Sunday who will feature again this weekend. “They’ll lt themselves up alright. “It would have been great to going into the match trying to reach two senior finals, but we have to focus on Sunday’s game now.” With Division One winners and  champions Dunloy out following their surprise loss to Loughgiel, the remaining sides will all fancy their chances of lting the Volunteer Cup later this month. The Shamrocks will get a chance to view their final opponents over the course of  minutes in Ballycastle on Sunday, but it would come as no great surprisean additional  minutes was required to separate St John’s and Cushendall."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"officials stay tight lipped over broken promise to clear kerbs","story":"OVER a year after kerbs at the entrance to Holy Cross Girls’ Primary School were painted red, white and blue by loyalists the Department for Infrastructure is remaining tight-lipped over its promise to clear up the mess.The kerbs at the school were painted in the run-up to last year’s marching season, but a community agreement to remove the paint was later reached.In October last year, the Department told us that after being asked to remove the paint it was seeking the necessary funds to have the work carried out.“The Department can confirm that it received a request for the removal of paint from the kerbs at the entrance to Holy Cross Girls’ School,” a spokesperson said at the time.“As it has been established that there is cross-community agreement for the removal of paint from all kerbs in the area, the local Division is currently seeking funding to have the work carried out.”The North Belfast News has spent a week trying to obtain an update on the state of play – but we have received no answer to our queries.There was widespread disappointment that the paint wasn’t removed in time for the children ing to school last month and local people are still in the dark as to when the paint will be removed.North Belfast Sinn Féin Councillor Ryan Murphy said: “It is unacceptable that the kerbstones at the front of Holy Cross Girls’ School have still not had red, white and blue paint removed from them.“A commitment was made long over a year ago for this to be done yet the paint is still there and a new school year has begun.“We are now seeing tension around the interface areas in North Belfast decrease, in line with this the Department should act and remove this paint, which was done in the summer of .“ I have written to the Department for Infrastructure to ask why their commitment was not followed through and for them to provide me with a timeframe for this work to be finished.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"relax and reset at the slieve donard","story":"AN invitation to indulge in an afternoon of post summer skin restoration was readily accepted by this reporter at the luxurious Slieve Donard Resort and Spa.With the last of the summer wardrobe packed away, spa clients were filing through the spa doors in buttoned up jackets, hats and scarfs keen to comfort their bodies in the resort’s numerous heady packages of rest and relaxation. I was booked into try their Interstellar Relaxation Experience with the package tailored to leave the senses ‘other worldly’.A warm welcome was extended at the spa entrance as my battered Converse were taken away to be swtly replaced with a cosy pair of slippers. After changing I met with my therapist for the afternoon, Leanne, who explained that the experience would entail a pressure point foot massage, hot stone back, neck and shoulder massage, regenerating jasmine infused facial with warming Space Mask and to finish a chance to sip over a glass of flora jasmine tea.Having an almost -month- year-old son, bag, baggage, pram, and the everyday ‘essentials’ to cover that role, my back and shoulders were in dire need of a serious overhaul and I was more than happy to let Leanne knead, massage and crack away at the numerous knots accumulated over the past two years.Having chose a detoxying body oil for the duration of the treatment, Leanne explained that the ingredients would still be working their magic  hours after, so Monday could be faced head on. Combining the very finest in the Spa’s renowned ESPA range, Leanne used the Optimal Skin Procleanser which acts as a cleaner, exfoliator and mask for visibly radiant skin, hydrating cleansing milk and from their age-defying range – which I was all for – the Tri-Active Advanced Instant Facial with the Regenerating Face Treatment Oil and Lt and Firm Mask. The treatment was further complimented with a pressure point foot massage and application of the very latest in beauty utopia, the self heating Spacemask, which works to relieve tiredness, eye strain and many other ‘earthly tensions’.ESPA’s Pink Hair and Scalp Mask was then applied to enhance the Tibetan scalp massage. By this stage I was wondering how I was going to get off the bed such was my relaxed state and as Leanne handed me a glass of flora jasmine and rose tea I felt completely chilled.The chance to enjoy the spa facilities – not too mention the spectacular scenery – is another added bonus of the treatment and helps to suspend the fact you have toto reality before the end of the day.We are all guilty of not making enough time for ourselves in modern society with many of us trying and in many cases failing to find the right mix of work le balance. The Spa at Slieve Donard’s staff, therapists and especially their autumn Interstellar package ensure that those who partake, their minds and bodies are transported to a better place – for a few hours at least. The Interstellar Relaxation autumn day spa experience runs until November . The treatment is priced at £ Monday-Friday at the Culloden Spa or £ at the Slieve Donard Spa. A £ supplement applies for Saturday and Sundays at both Spas.

We also cannot thank Ciaran Cunningham of Michael Brentnall Solicitors enough for his help with getting this disgraceful decision overturned.“Roisin still has a huge battle ahead of her but we believe this new treatment will be successful, her new treatment is very tough on her, Roisin’s cancer is a very fast growing cancer, her new treatment is making her very lethargic and it has nasty side effects but she is prepared, she knows what she is up against and she will continue to fight.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37422083.ece/0b164/AUTOCROP/w620/Arlene_foster_DUP_001.jpg","title":"dups foster calls for cool heads in febrile atmosphere over brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Quoting the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson who also said there could never be a border of any kind down the Irish Sea he asked for the Prime Minister to confirm any deal which \"carved off\" Northern Ireland leaving it in the EU customs union and parts of the single market and \"separated through a border in the Irish Sea from the UKs own internal market, could never be accepted by her\".\"Will she confirm it is single market and customs union, the UK leaving the EU together with no part hived off either in the single market or customs dferences \"A situation where NI businesses can both export freely to Great Britain and the EU... would be a good position for those Northern Ireland businesses.Theresa MayFacebookTwitterThe Prime Minister reaffirmed that the UK would leave the EU but said a deal which allowed Northern Ireland to export freely to both the rest of the UK and Ireland would be beneficial to business.\"We will be leaving the European Union together. I am very clear there should be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but as we put forward proposals we can deliver on that and maintain the integrity of our union,\" she said.\"And we have made that very clear when the EU made their proposal which would have effectively carved Northern Ireland away from the rest of the UK in their backstop proposal.Christopher Stalfords tweet.\"It is precisely why we can not accept their backstop to the backstop because they continue to want to see that. What we want to see in a backstop is a situation where Northern Ireland businesses can both export freely to Great Britain and the EU.\"Actually that would be a good position for those Northern Ireland businesses.\" Later South Belfast DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly asked for a firm commitment that nothing would be agreed with the EU which would exclude Northern Ireland from future trade deals.The Prime Minister rejected this saying any future trade deal would be for the whole UK including Northern Ireland."},{"url":null,"title":"sobering assessment of hard brexit impact on allireland industry","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

The paper says potential consequences of a no-deal Brexit include:Legal protection for drinks linked to Ireland - such as Irish Whiskey, Irish Cream Liqueur and Irish Poitin - could be jeopardised.Northern Ireland producers access to global free trade opportunities would be at risk.Immediate tarfs on barley, malt, glass bottles, apples, finished cider and other supply chain inputs.Regulatory and customs checks at the border, leading to signicant delays and additional costs for , cross-border truck movements.Requirement for up-front VAT payments on cross-border trade.The potential for regulatory ergence across a range of standards, from labelling to bottle sizes.ABFI is the all-island trade association for the Irish drinks industry and forms part of Ibec, Irelands largest business representative body.ABFI director Patricia Callan said: \"The Irish drinks industry is a highly integrated all-island sector thats important for both the Irish and Northern Irish economies.\"For us, Brexit could be highly disruptive, particularlythere was to be a disastrous no-deal scenario. However, this need not be the case and we would urge all parties to seek to ensure that a withdrawal agreement is concluded and that a no-deal Brexit is avoided.\"We want to see clear, robust provisions to safeguard the all-island economy and to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland.\"The ABFI paper outlines that global drinks exports from Ireland were valued at €.bnin .The total value of trade in drinks products between the UK and Ireland was €m , one-third of which, €m , was north-south trade.The UK remains the dominant market for Irish beerand cider .Ms Callan added: \"In terms of EU-UK trade, the economic interests of both the EU and the UK would be best served by the UK remaining in a customs union with the EU. If this cannot be achieved, then a comprehensive alternative approach must be put in place. A fall-back to EU external tarfs or WTO rates must be avoided.\"A no-deal Brexit could see a range of new tarfs on cross-border supply chains, including:Tarfs of up to €a tonne on barley and €a tonne on malt.An EU external tarf of % on  million glass bottles imported into Ireland from the UK.A .% tarf on apples grown in Northern Ireland.\"Tarfs would add signicant costs to Northern Irish whiskey distilleries and breweries buying barley and malt from Ireland, to Irish craft distilleries and breweries buying specialist malts from the UK and to Irish cider producers buying apples from Co Armagh,\" said Ms Callan.\"Similarly, tarfs on finished cider products would damage the cost competitiveness of Irish and Northern Irish cider producers, threatening sales and jobs.\"Ms Callan said Brexit not only risks disrupting free trade between Ireland and the UK, it threatens trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the world. \"We do not want Northern Ireland producers to face any signicant comparative disadvantagethey lose access to EU free trade agreements,\" she said."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may progress on irish border issues but no agreement on backstop","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

There are fears that checkpoints and cameras could become the target of sectarian violence.– What is the UK Government’s favoured solution London thinks the border can be kept open as part of a broader trade deal which does away with the need for checks.– What is Brussels proposing The EU is insisting on a “backstop” arrangement as a fallback to be used until a broader deal is in place.This would involve Northern Ireland effectively remaining part of the European customs area, with checks taking place at ports and ferries between the region and the British mainland instead of at the border.– What does the UK think of that Theresa May says no prime minister could accept it, as it would create a customs border down the Irish Sea and undermine the integrity of the United Kingdom.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  – So what does London propose Mrs May has put forward an alternative backstop, featuring a temporary arrangement keeping the whole of the UK in a customs union, which she expects to be lted by the end of .– Is that acceptable to Brussels Onlythere is a “backstop to the backstop”, so that when the temporary UK-wide arrangement runs out, the Northern Irish carve-out would come into effect.– Does Mrs May at least have support in the UK for her proposal A lot of Conservative MPs – reportedly including some Cabinet ministers – are concerned that a “temporary” backstop would become permanent. They want any agreement to include a firm date for it to lapse.– When will this come to a head Leaders of the remaining  EU states meet on Wednesday to decide whether to call a special summit in November to provide one last chance for agreement or to use the mooted gathering as an opportunity to step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit.If agreement is reached, MPs will vote on it in the House of Commons before Christmas, followed by a vote of MEPs in the European Parliament.– If Mrs May can reach agreement with Brussels, can she get it through Parliament This is highly questionable.Depending on the nature of any deal, she could lose support from as many as  hardline Brexiteers on one side of her party or an estimated  Europhile Tories on the other.The DUP’s  MPs have made clear they will not back anything which means Northern Ireland being treated dferently from the rest of the UK.And the PM will struggle to win much support from Labour MPs, with the party’s leadership insisting it will vote down anything which fails its six tests.– Are there any other remaining obstacles Both sides say progress has been made on other issues in recent days.But there has so far been no public announcement of agreement on the issue of the European Court of Justice’s role in overseeing the withdrawal deal or the future status of geographical indications which protect local delicacies like Stilton cheese, Champagne or Parma ham."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article36927936.ece/33a2a/AUTOCROP/w620/AFP_155984.jpg","title":"meghan markle is pregnant duchess and prince harry expecting first baby","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Bredagh had other ideas and points from the towering Niall McFarland and Joe Hanrahan suddenly had their side in front.Gerard Quinn fired over the equalising score in the fth minute, but it was all down hill after this for Ballycran as they were put under the cosh by a blistering Bredagh attack.Unanswered points from Hanrahan, Sean Hughes and the fleet-footed Ronan Costello had Bredagh - to - in front after  minutes. It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

Master Cadets must successfully complete a demanding course designed to broaden and develop further the leadership, instructional and administrative responsibilities of senior Cadets who have already attained the prestigious Four Star Army Proficiency Certicate.The certicates were presented recently by Gillian Bingham, High Sherf of County Antrim.Congratulating the young people, Colonel Sam McCammond, Commandant of the ndBattalion Army Cadet Force, said: ldquoWe are delighted to see the enthusiasm and commitment of our Cadets recognised with the achievement of these latest accolades.ldquoWe are enormously proud of them and, indeed, they are each a credit not only to their detachments, but also to their families, schools and the wider community.ldquoAt a time when society tends to be quick to find fault with the younger generation, these young people are demonstrating great qualities and it is an absolute pleasure to see them reap the rewards of their hard work and sense of purpose.Col McCammond said the Cadet movement offers its members ldquogreat fun and camaraderie and also ldquoopens the door for signicant personal development.He continued: The awards which these Cadets, drawn from detachments at Down High School, Banbridge, Ballygowan and Killyleagh, collect today celebrate their progress and give our Cadets something truly signicant to put on their personal statements as they prepare for college or apply for their first jobs.ldquoI congratulate them and the adult leaders who inspire and instruct them..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Countdown until doors open at new Down Leisure Centre  ","story":"THE new poundm Down Leisure Centre will open at the end of next month.The stunning three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels and has the ldquowow factor Newry, Mourne and Down Council always promised it would have.Stretching across , square metres, council officials have no doubt the futuristic building will be the envy of many and viewed as an exemplar for others.The new centre features a  metre, six-lane swimming pool, a teaching pool with moveable floor, relaxation area with sauna, steam room and vitality pool along with a four-court multi-use sports hall.There is also a fantastic fitness suite with an extensive selection of equipment with some items the first of their kind to feature in any leisure centre in Ireland. The new centre also has two multi-purpose exercise studios featuring hi-tech spinning bikes.Council officials have this week set out the programme for closing the current leisure centre and opening its stunning replacement.Itrsquos anticipated that the existing leisure centre mdash which has long since passed its sell-by date mdash will close early next month. The new centre is expected to open three weeks later.When the door closes on the current facility, which will be subsequently bulldozed to pave the way for the construction of an expansive new car park, staff will transfer to the new multi-million pound centre for dedicated training and induction.Council officials are drawing up a programme ahead of the official opening to provide members of sports clubs and the public with an opportunity to sample what the new st century leisure centre has to offer and a chance to view its high-tech equipment.It is hoped the new centrersquos public launch will take place over the weekend of November  and  with full public access from November . These dates have to be confirmed.During the transition from the old centre to its modern replacement, the public are asked to use the local authorityrsquos nearby facilities at the Ballymote Health and Well-Being Centre in Downpatrick and the Newcastle Centre.Council officials are delighted with the new centre, in particular, the new teaching pool which has a moveable floor.Over recent years, there has been increasing pressure on swimming classes at Down Leisure Centre.Council officials are confident this will soon ease and are grateful to the public for their patience during the construction process.There are miles of pipework and electric cables with the plant room mdash the new leisure complexrsquos nerve centre mdash resembling something akin to a science fiction film set.Council director Michael Lipsett has described the new centre as a ldquofantastic building which people will appreciate and enjoy. He said it will also be a pleasure for the local authorityrsquos leisure staff to move to a modern building.The senior council official said everyone associated with the new centre, from the designers to the builders and the councillors who supported it financially, deserve credit for the part they played..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Down High pupils make waves at RYA  ","story":"DOWN Highrsquos sailors took to the water at the weekend with over  others to battle it out at the RYA Northern Ireland Youth Championships and Schools Cup at Cultra.The sailors from the Downpatrick school battled hard in tough conditions, with a special mention to going to Adam Fermor, sailing in the Laser Standard fleet, who made a clean sweep, with five first place podium finished from five races.Evie Mclaughlin also performed impressively, finishing as third lady overall, in the Laser Radial Fleet.

The former motocross ace has offered his expertise to teach young riders basic biking skills.ldquoMotorcycling is getting bigger every year, Mr McBride said. Itrsquos important we give riders some idea how to handle their machines.ldquoIrsquove had teachers from schools in Newcastle and Ballynahinch ands members of local road safety committees all expressing interest in the idea, he told the Recorder this week.ldquoWe are waiting now to hear the police reaction and then we can get together and work out something definite.Mr McBridersquos concern comes with a rising number of motorcycle accidents in the province. In the Ballynahinch area alone there have been several serious accidents this year.Among the proposals he has suggested to augment his own coaching course is specially built lsquotrail parksrsquo and an elementary riding test before anyone is allowed to buy a machine.ldquoPeople must know how to ride their machines safely, he said. Balance and technique are important.ldquoAnother important area is maintenance. Accidents can be caused by simple things like a soft tyre or a loose chain, but too many youngsters donrsquot come to garages because they are frightened by high costs.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle Round Tablersquos attempt to raise over pound, for the Dr Barnardorsquos childrenrsquos charity got underway this week. Four members, Billy Ogle, Felton Williamson, Sam Harrison and Joe Toland were flagged off from the Slieve Donard Hotel to start their marathon visitation around Ireland.Every Round Table in Ireland will be visited and a competition has been organised to guess the number of miles the journey will take. Each Round Table has received tickets on which you can guess the mileage on the car when the journey ends.Fty pence is the price per guess and the winner will receive pound. In this way, the Round Table hope to raise in excess of pound, for their selected charity. The drivers will be collecting the ticket stubs from each Round Table as they visits the towns.The drive began on Tuesday at  noon and with a bit of luck and safe driving the boys should be at their last port of call in Wexford on Friday. The winning ticket will be announced at lunch on Sunday.DOWNPATRICK mdash Window-smashing, ransacking vandals left their trademark on yet another school last week when they broke into St Patrickrsquos Boysrsquo Primary School in Downpatrick.The St Dillonrsquos Avenue school was badly vandalised with the tuck shop destroyed, windows and door  smashed and ious types of equipment wrecked.The latest incident happened last Wednesday night and came less than a week after police had been allied to see the extent of the damage caused by vandals at the nearby St Maryrsquos Secondary School on the Ardglass Road.On that occasion pictures and statues were knocked off walls and broken and several other items, including doors, were badly damaged. Last Wednesday nightrsquos attack on St Patrickrsquos Primary School has been equally disturbing to police, who feel that a new wave of criminology seems to be underway.This time they witnessed the destruction of the schoolrsquos tuck shop which had just been stocked up with almost pound worth of stock. Everything was scattered round the hall and even on to the adjoining football field. Fire extinguishers were turned on and directed at tape recorders, which were destroyed.Police are treating the crime seriously and have appealed to for any information to help them in their inquiries. Fingerprints have been taken.This latest wave of school destruction is already being regarded as monstrous in terms of the community. No-one, it seems, saw anything, but this could be indicative of the public turning their back, lest they should suffer recriminations.Brother Otteran, headmaster at St Patrickrsquos, was abhorred at the destruction. He permitted a Down Recorder photographer to visit the scene and had no objections to the crime being publicised.HOLLYWOOD mdash The widely-held belief that Hollywood actress Greer Garson was born and bred in Down District has been scotched.

It is turning into death-trap with dficult turning circles that intrude on pedestrians and oncoming traffic, she explained.ldquoThe meeting with roads officials took place at .am so they were able to see the situation for themselves with everybody having to demonstrate nimble footwork, ing out of the way of oncoming traffic.Cllr Enright said the pavement currently ran only half way up Racecourse Hill and the road was not wide enough for two-way traffic.ldquoRoads officials have agreed to a one-way system which will allow vehicles to drive down the hill when a new pavement is in place. Traffic calming measures will also be provided to ensure vehicles do not race down the hill. I have been informed that they now plan to include the project in their budget for next year.Cllr Enright said the build-up of traffic on the minor road was triggered by the development of the new public sector campus at the Downshire Civic Centre which is home to Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Fire and Rescue Service, Housing Executive and Downe Hospital.He added: ldquoThe expected investment in roads improvement for the campus never took place with the focus being on the Newry end of the council area.ldquoThe ring road to the public sector campus currently peters out in open country around Struell Wells.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets. He said the main thrust was to provide a safer, quality service.The chief executive revealed that implementing the new model will require the recruitment of an additional  frontline ambulance staff over the next three to five years and cost in the region of poundm.ldquoOur firm view is that the proposed changes will provide a better quality and safer service and go a long way to meeting the challenge in providing an effective response times to communities such as the one in this area which has not been getting the sort of response that we would wish, said Mr Bloomfield, who viewed Mondayrsquos meeting as the first in a series as part of the organisationrsquos consultation on how it aims to improve services for patients.He continued: ldquoResponse times in this area are challenging, but not particularly dferent to other areas. I have been so impressed at the commitment, dedication and professionalism of our staff to provide the high quality of response that they do in all communities. Without doubt, we only have the quality service we currently have as a result of the huge efforts staff go to.ldquoI have met staff in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch and the efforts and dedication staff go to to provide the best response they can is humbling and I am proud to lead the organisation, but it is not sustainable. The level of effort that staff are required to put in on a constant basis is not reasonable and not fair to continue to expect it.Mr Bloomfield said that while ambulance staff always put the needs of the public first, that level of effort and commitment on an ongoing basis against a rising demand was ldquosimply not sustainable.He said the organisation received around , calls a year, equating to a  per cent increase on the number since  . Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Primark says it is doing all it can to resolve the issue of the safety cordon around their main Belfast store, which was destroyed by fire in August. Liam McBurney PA Wire The local authority said its own expert advice was that Primark’s plan “wouldn’t sufficiently guarantee public safety”.Revealing that its proposal “has not been approved”, a spokesperson for Primark said: “Bank Buildings is a listed building of historic signicance to Belfast and we are committed to a conservation led approach. In order to start work on the building, Primark is required to undertake a specic planning process which is very complex and involves a wide range of stakeholders. We are fully engaged in this process and while it is ongoing, we are also working at full capacity on finding a way to reduce the cordon and open up the Castle Place junction.“On nd October we submitted a proposal that could have reduced the cordon within weeks, unfortunately this proposal has not been approved but we are committed to finding a solution and are working closely with the council to agree this.“We recognise how important this is to Belfast city and once we have permission to start work, the reduced cordon will be put in place as quickly as possible.”The spokesperson added: “Primark acknowledges the impact that the devastating fire at Bank Buildings has had on Belfast. We are committed to the business and wider community and have recently made a £, donation to Belfast City Council’s City Recovery Investment Programme. This fund is being allocated by the council to those local businesses impacted by the fire. We also recognise that Primark has always been a driver of footfall into the city centre and we are determined to be up and trading as soon as we can.”Responding, a spokesperson for Belfast City Council said Primark’s proposal to reduce the cordon “did not sufficiently guarantee public safety.”“Reducing the cordon and opening up pedestrian access in the city centre is the priority for Belfast City Council, and council is working closely with Primark to consider all options to that end. However, due to the instability of the building, any reduction of the cordon can only happen once it is safe to do so,” the spokesperson said.“The existing cordon is having a signicant impact on footfall, and businesses in the area are suffering as a result. Council is urgently seeking solutions to restore pedestrian access as soon as possible. In doing so, we have commissioned the advice of three separate independent structural engineers, who assessed Primark’s proposal within days of Primark’s submission. All three separately recommended that the proposal to reduce the cordon did not sufficiently guarantee public safety due primarily to the instability of the upper part of the building, the potential for collapse and their assessment of the range within which debris would fall.”Earlier this month, Primark lodged an application with the council for listed building consent for conservation works to Bank Buildings, “involving the taking down, recording and assessment for restoration purposes of the building above the fourth floor cornice line to the Bank Street, Castle Street and Castle Place elevations of the building for off-site storage”.It said the proposed works were “required to facilitate further investigations on the structural integrity of Bank Buildings” following the recent fire which completely destroyed the store.A public consultation on the issue is ongoing and a special meeting of Belfast City Council’s Planning Committee will be called by Friday, October  to consider the application.Traffic and travel: road closures and delays possible with resurfacing scheme on major route Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“Based on the information contained in Primark’s application, council believes it is reasonable to assume thatplanning consent is given and the works outlined in the application are undertaken, Castle Place is likely to be the first location where the cordon could potentially be reduced. We do not expect Castle Street to reopen until the façade retention system is fully in place. An engineering solution for this is currently being designed and progressed,” the council spokesperson added.• Read related story: Primark fire sparks dramatic fall in Belfast city centre footfallJohnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Disclaimer  Privacy  Cookies Policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimage/1.8669832.1539621636!/image/image.jpg","title":"deal could be delayed again  ","story":".... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast Newsletter and agreeing to Johnston Press# Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast Newsletter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from Johnston Press , via occasional emails, to keep you informed about new features, special offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". s  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+          TriggerPrompt url  http:survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site_oqfshupypyivmsxzqude +url +  +:  + random + .getTime + afterel.setAttribute head  document[]  document[]headChildTriggerPrompt   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business NewsletterRegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat News Politics Crime Farming Education Business Transport Environment Health Your Say Opinion Offbeat Sport Football Rugby Union Cricket Golf Motorcycling Boxing More Sport Whats On Music Theatre  Comedy Arts TV  Film Eating Out Lestyle Nostalgia People Family Gadgets  Tech Outdoors Travel Cars Read This           Deal lsquocould be delayed againrsquo   Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...BRIGHTCOVE.createBrightcovePlayerInstance Published::Monday  October Share this article window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringSign Up To Our Daily Newsletter ipaddress.getJSON .keypress.focus.on email  .val.ajax\",source_url: location.href,source_website_category: \"Local\", \"text\".done .removeAttr  .html  .html.valBrexit: Leo Varadkar says deal with UK could be delayed until DecemberThe taoiseach said negotiations are continuing but admitted “no one knows for sure” when an agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom can be reached.   Leo Varadkar said there were some fundamentals the EU couldnt compromise on Mr Varadkar said the Irish government has been preparing for a no-deal scenario but added that officials “don’t believe” it is the likely outcome.“We are hiring the necessary custom officials and making the necessary adaptations to the ports and airports that we need in a no-deal scenario, and also a deal scenario, because even a good deal will result in changes,” he said.“The dference in a no-deal is that the changes will be greater and they won’t be quicker.“The negotiations are still ongoing, we are at a sensitive phase and I know some people were optimistic about an agreement on the withdrawal agreement this week. I have to say I always thought that was unlikely, I figure November or December the best opportunity for a deal. This is a dynamic situation.“We are always open to compromise, as the EU of course we are, but there are some fundamentals we can’t compromise on.”He said the British government needs to honour its commitment to a backstop agreement which is legally operable and legally binding to ensure no hard border emerges on the island of Ireland.Mr Varadkar added: “Any withdrawal agreement requires parliamentary ratication by the European Parliament and by Westminster, so we’ve always worked back from that timeline, and the view is that in order to meet that timeline we would have to have a deal before the end of the year.“The initial target was October and that could be back to November.“The possibility remains open to having an emergency summit in Novemberwe can get to a deal.“For all of us, but particularly the UK, the consequences of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March is potentially catastrophic. Really bad for Ireland, relatively bad for the EU, but quite a disaster for the UK, and I am sure that the British government is motivated to make sure we don’t end up in a no-deal scenario.“I spoke to Theresa May yesterday and she assured me of her commitment to getting a deal done and her commitment to honouring the commitment that they made on several occasions to having a backstop as part of the agreement and making sure it’s legally operable.”Primark proposal to reduce cordon around Bank Buildings ‘not approved’ by councilQueen’s students oppose talk by Israeli ambassador Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

On Monday, QUB Students’ Union issued an eleventh hour plea for the university to withdraw Mr Regev’s invitation, saying it serves to “normalise the actions of the Israeli government” against the Palestinian people.SU president Connor Veighey said his union “recognises the continued suffering of the Palestinian people” and supports student efforts “to highlight the injustices inflicted upon them by Israeli occupation.”He added: “This event highlights a blatant disregard of the university’s commitment to equality and social justice.”Robert Murtagh, the SU vice-president said: “Mark Regev’s political presence contributes nothing to academic understanding of Israeli government actions.“The university should not allow its academic reputation to be exploited by the Israeli government as they attempt to validate their brutal and repressive actions.”A protest against the visit has been organised by the Belfast Palestine Solidarity Campaign.In a Facebook post, the organiser said: “This is a terrible breach of the academic boycott called for by Palestinian civil society. “We call on all solidarity activists and all trade unions to demonstrate against this violation of the call for BDS .”A QUB spokeswoman said an invitation had also been sent to the Palestinian ambassador to speak at a later date.‘Universities play an important role in society as places of debate and discussion where ideas can be tested without fear of control, where students learn to challenge ideas and think for themselves, and where rationality underpins the pursuit of knowledge,” she said.“Queen’s permits freedom of thought and expression, within a framework of respect for the rights of other persons, and academic freedom is enshrined as a guiding principle in the University’s Charter and Statutes.Orange Order defends role in ‘raising educational attainment’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“In accordance with these principles, invitations were issued to both the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors to the UK to visit the university and attend separate events for the benefit of Masters students who study subjects related to politics and conflict resolution.”The spokeswoman added: “The workshops will provide students the opportunity to directly engage with the ambassadors, stimulate debate and discussion and enrich the learning experience.”try catch     .               ..

It is believed he left CRSI after his arrest in .It also reported that CRSI employs Sean O’Reilly, jailed in  in relation to what was understood to have been an attempted punishment shooting, and that Gerry Ruddy – one of CRSI’s directors – is an ex-leader of the INLA’s political wing, the IRSP.When looking into CRSI, The Times focused largely on the backing given by Quaker organisation the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust, which has given roughly £, to the group.However, the News Letter has delved into the accounts to find other funders too, and can now reveal the extent of support given by the International Committee of the Red Cross.CRSI’s accounts list the following sums from the Red Cross: £, in   £, in   and £, in  .

The IFI said it provided the cash to “build sustainable peace and prosperity”.It said it only funds groups that agree “not to provide material support or resources to any inidual or group engaged in illegal activity”.Previously the News Letter has revealed donations from Co-Operation Irelandand Belfast City CouncilPOLICE RAIDS AND -MONTH -PLUS INVESTIGATION BY REGULATOR:As well as the backgrounds of some of its staff and directors being in the spotlight, CRSI has also been the focus of police and Charity Commission activity.The Charity Commission began a probe into CRSI in April .While it said it cannot comment on a live investigation, it said: “As our Serious Incident Reporting guidance highlights, where someone within or connected to the charity is found to have business with or links to terrorist groups, the commission expect this to be reported to us and the PSNI immediately, including how the issue is being managed.”Two CRSI properties were searched in , and one in June this year, by police investigating dissident republicanism.The PSNI said: “Detectives from Serious Crime Branch conducting an ongoing investigation into dissident republican terrorist activity have been in contact with the Charity Commission. Should any criminal offences be identied, police will take appropriate action.”When the News Letter previously prepared an article about CRSI, it was advised to speak to director Gerry Ruddy , but he declined to comment and directed the newspaper to his funders instead, before the line went dead.When the News Letter contacted him again for this new article, a woman answered.This reporter asked to speak to Gerry Ruddy. She asked who was calling, and when told it was the News Letter she said: “No thank you.”A man in the background said: “No comment.” The line went dead.The News Letter phoned again, hoping to leave a numberMr Ruddy changed his mind. The woman said: “This is harassment. There is no-one of that name here. Go away.”The line went dead again.try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon.

I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here.

It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner.

He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

I grew up in an era where comedians actually had the benefit of free speech and you simply switched off or walked outyou didn’t find them funny. Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
