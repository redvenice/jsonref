which was very badly received in Brussels - and a gaffe in which he referred to his Chinese wife  as \u0027Japanese\u0027 as a reception in China.Last month he went on a tour of Africa in which his Chinese wife Lucia made a major appearance, after he gaffed by forgetting her nationality.Last week he called for a \u0027decisive\u0027 hike in defence spending to see off the rising threat from Russia and China – in a speech seen as a clear signal of his leadership ambitions. Speaking at the Lord Mayor\u0027s Banquet Mansion House in the City of London, he said the UK\u0027s hard power must be strengthened, with billions more spent on new capabilities to tackle drones and cyber attacks.Rory Stewart: Remainer rising star and friend of royals who is not short of confidence                    The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already marriedPenrith MP, 46, is a former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and SussexOld Etonian ex-soldier worked for Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wale sin AfghanistanVoted for Remain and still backs a soft BrexitLeadership odds 161The former prisons minister who once vowed to quit if they did not improve within a year declared his candidacy almost as soon as he was promoted to the Cabinet.He stepped up to International Development Secretary earlier this month to replace Ms Mordaunt and days later declared he will run for the Tory leadership.The Theresa May loyalist praised the PM for her \u0027courageous effort\u0027 to pass her Brexit deal but admitted he would throw his hat in the ring when she steps down.Urging his party not to \u0027try to outdo Nigel Farage\u0027, the development secretary said the Tories should \u0027stretch all the way from Ken Clarke to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027.He also lashed out at Mr Johnson at the weekend, saying he would not serve under a No Deal-supporting PM. The Old Etonian former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex previously worked for the Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wales in Afghanistan.He has also written several books about walking. The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already married.   Seen as highly intelligent his staunch Remainer and soft Brexit credentials look likely to count against him in a race set to be dominated by the Brexiteer wing of the party. Matt Hancock: Waffle-loving health secretary who wants Tories to choose a younger leader                    Mr Hancock took stroopwafels in for Cabinet the day after he was pulled up for eating them on televisionThe youngest front-runner at 40A Remainer who now backs Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealHe wants the party to look to the future and attract younger votersLeadership odds 201The Health Secretary is, like his predecessor Jeremy Hunt, seen as something of a unity candidate.The 40-year-old father of three is seen as a safe pair of hands despite a few teething problems in his latest Cabinet role.Last year he was accused of breaking ethics rules after he praised a private health firm app in a newspaper article sponsored by its maker.But he has since made some hard-hitting interventions in areas like the impact of social media on health. Last month he joined Ms Mordaunt in backing the Generation Why? report showing that the Tories needed to become more relevant to younger voters. He called on the party to change its \u0027tone\u0027 towards modern Britain or face Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, in a speech widely seen as setting out his leadership credentials.This week he showed his human side by unashamedly chomping calorific stroopwafels before a TV broadcast, saying he people should enjoy things in moderation. Penny Mordaunt: The highly regarded Brexiteer promoted to take on defence                Ms Mordaunt is an outsider for the leadership but is highly thought of in Brexiteer groupsThe MP for Portsmouth North is a Royal Navy reservistHighly regarded in Brexiteer circles She has been consistently tipped to quit over Brexit but remains in the Cabinet Once appeared in a swimsuit in a reality TV show Leadership odds 251 The new Defence Secretary - the first woman ever to hold the post - is highly regarded in Brexiteer circles. The Royal Navy reservist, 46, carved out a niche at International Development with some eye-catching suggests about changing how the UK spends disperses aid cash.She has become an increasingly serious politician after initially being seen as lighthearted when she appeared in a swimsuit in ITV reality TV show Splash!She was promoted earlier this month to replace Gavin Williamson when he was sacked for leaking details from a confidential meeting about Huawei.   Over the preceding few months she was at the heart of persistent rumours that she would be the next Brexit-supporting minister out the door over Brexit. She has yet to announce she is running but last month she backed a thinktank report saying the party needed to attract new voters.She said the party needed to \u0027act swiftly\u0027 to win over the younger generations who were turning away from the centre-Right in \u0027unprecedented\u0027 numbers. On Wednesday, after other Cabinet Brexiteers including Andrea Leadsom were notable by their absence during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, she remained at her post. It remains to be seen whether this loyalty will count for or against her. Sajid Javid: Remainer star who has run into trouble over knife crime and refugees             Sajid Javid has seen his stock take a hit over the knife crime crisis and migrants crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe most senior cabinet contenderVoted Remain but wants to see Brexit deliveredFaced criticism as Home Secretary But has taken a hard line on Shamima Begum case Leadership odds 331The Home Secretary, a Remainer who wants to see Brexit delivered, was the leading candidate from inside the Cabinet to replace Mrs May.After replacing Amber Rudd last year he consciously put clear ground between himself and the Prime Minister on issues like caps on skilled migrants after Brexit.But his credentials have taken a hit recently. He finds himself facing ongoing criticism of his handling of the knife crime crisis affecting UK cities, which sparked a Cabinet row over funding for police.He also lost face over his handling of the influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in January, being seen to move slowly in realising the scale of the problem.But more recently the 49-year-old Bromsgove MP has made a serious of hardline decision designed to go down well with Tory voters. Most notably they have included moving to deprive London teenager turned Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, 19, of her British citizenship, after she was discovered among former Islamic State members in a Syrian refugee camp. Steve Baker: Brexiteer \u0027Spartan\u0027 and self-styled \u0027hardman\u0027 who refused to budge over Brexit               Brexit \u0027hardman\u0027 Steve Baker has previously threatened to leave the Tories over BrexitFormer Brexit minister who resigned last yearA member of the European Research Group which has has opposed Theresa May\u0027s deal in every voteThreatened to quit the Tories over Brexit earlier this yearLeadership odds 331 The High Wycombe MP, 47, is a Brexit purist who has never backed Theresa May\u0027s deal.In March he even threatened to quit the party over the issue, saying: \u0027We\u0027ve been put in this place by people whose addiction to power without responsibility has led them to put the choice of No Brexit or this deal.\u0027I may yet resign the whip than be part of this.\u0027The married former RAF engineer officer described himself as a \u0027hardman\u0027 in a TV interview this year, only to be shown shortly afterwards in a documentary crying in his office.Today he told the BBC: \u0027There is no point shying away from it, people have been asking me to stand. I have had a degree of support from across the country that I could never have foreseen.\u0027I have also had some MPs asking me to stand but I need to face up to the challenge of taking a decision on whether I should do it.\u0027Sir Graham Brady: Backbench kingmaker with an eye on the throne?               The chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs has played a key but neutral role in the downfall of Theresa MayQuit today as chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPsHe went into Downing Street today to tell Mrs May time was upBut his name was oddly missing from a later statement on leadership  Leadership odds  501As chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs he has played a key but neutral role in the downfall of Theresa May.But he quit that post after nine years today ahead o a possible run for the top job. Despite being a Brexiteer he has been an independent arbiter, overseeing the no-confidence vote Mrs May survived in December and reportedly opposing attempts to change the rules to dethrone her early.The married father of two has held several meetings with the PM in recent weeks as the mutiny against her grew and this morning saw her in Downing Street where he told her that her time was up.But his name was conspicuously absent from a later Conservative Party statement about how the leadership election would happen. He told the Press Association: \u0027I have been approached by a number of colleagues across the party both inside and outside Parliament asking me to put myself forward as a candidate.\u0027Therefore I have taken the decision to stand down from the position of chairman of the 1922 Committee in order to ensure a fair and transparent election process.\u0027I am considering the approaches I have received and will make a further statement in due course.\u0027His Brexiteer credentials and honourable display as Mrs May was brought down will count in his favour but he lacks frontbench experience, having a sole three-year stint as a shadow Europe minister 15 years ago on his CV. Esther McVey: Former TV presenter and minister who quit Government over Brexit                The former television journalist, is engaged to fellow Tory backbench Brexiteer Philip Davies, 47The 51-year-old was Work and Pensions Secretary until quitting in NovemberShe was a presenter on GMTV before entering politicsIs engaged to fellow Tory MP Philip DaviesThis week launched a \u0027blue collar Conservatism\u0027 project Leadership odds 501 The former Work and Pensions Secretary declared her leadership bid last month and has set out a stall as a right-wing blue-collar candidate from a working class  Liverpudlian background.The former television journalist, is engaged to fellow Tory backbench Brexiteer  Philip Davies, 47, having previously had a romance with ex-minister Ed Vaizey. She has no children.This week she set out her leadership pitch by calling for the party to use £7billion of foreign aid cash on buckling British police forces and schools.Launching a \u0027blue collar conservatism\u0027 campaign the Brexiteer MP, 51, said her party had \u0027lost the trust\u0027 of working people by failing to leave the EU already and must pursue \u0027radical conservative agendas\u0027 to win it back\u0027.She said that keeping cash in the UK that is currently sent abroad would allow an increase of £4billion in spending on schools and £3billion for police, which are both demanding more money.And she declined to rule out doing a post-election deal with Nigel Farage - but said that if the Tories got the UK out it would mean that his Brexit Party would have no reason to exist. Speaking in Westminster she reiterated her call for the next party leader to be \u0027someone who believes in Brexit\u0027 - a dig at Mrs May, who supported the Remain campaign in 2016. Kit Malthouse: Self-proclaimed peacemaker who says it is time for a \u0027new generation\u0027 to take charge Known for his efforts to forge a compromise between Tory Brexit factions Entered the Commons in David Cameron\u0027s 2015 election victory Served as deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London Leadership odds 1001           Kit Malthouse, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative PartyHousing minister Kit Malthouse is best known for his abortive efforts to forge a joint position between Tory Remainers and Brexiteers - which would essentially have meant leaving the EU more slowly but with looser trade ties.It was modestly labelled as the \u0027Malthouse Compromise\u0027.Now the 52-year-old, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative Party. Previously the Liverpool-born father-of-three served as a deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London. He says his core offer in the contest is a new social contract, \u0027a good job, a secure home and a brilliant school. Job, house, school - the foundations of a secure and happy life\u0027.However, even though Tory leadership contests often throw up surprises, it is unclear whether he will have the support needed to edge out the big beasts.   "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/09/24/14/4516332-0-image-m-65_1537797114470.jpg","title":"George Michaels ex lover Fadi Fawaz squatting singers 5m London home","story":"Share this articleGeorge Michael\u0027s ex is SQUATTING in the star\u0027s £5m home despite legal letters"},{"url":null,"title":"Eerie pictures ornate ceilings beautifully tiled pool swimming baths built 1907","story":"Share this article          While one of the baths\u0027 pools is open to the public, the other, which is shown in the pictures closed in 2003         Other striking shots show the locker rooms, protective railings (pictured) to stop people falling from the upper balconies overlooking the huge hall and the red-brick exterior of the building         The baths were opened in 1907 as an addition to the Free Library (1895) forming a group of public buildings         The baths were opened in 1907 as an addition to a library and formed a group of public buildings         Options for the future development of the baths are being explored and Historic England is providing a substantial repair grant for the Gala pool roof in conjunction with Birmingham City Council         The baths, which is connected to a library, would have been one the places the community would have gone sociallyThe baths were opened in 1907 as an addition to the Free Library (1895) forming a group of public buildings. While one of the baths\u0027 pools is open to the public, the other, which is shown in the pictures closed in 2003.Options for the future of the baths are being explored and Historic England is providing a substantial repair grant for the Gala pool roof in conjunction with Birmingham City Council - and  development phase of works has commenced \u0027This is my favourite type of place to explore as it gives you a chance to see something you would never normally get to see and how it works,\u0027 added the urban explorer.\u0027The baths, which is joined a library, would have been one the places the community would have gone socially.

which was very badly received in Brussels - and a gaffe in which he referred to his Chinese wife  as \u0027Japanese\u0027 as a reception in China.Last month he went on a tour of Africa in which his Chinese wife Lucia made a major appearance, after he gaffed by forgetting her nationality.Last week he called for a \u0027decisive\u0027 hike in defence spending to see off the rising threat from Russia and China – in a speech seen as a clear signal of his leadership ambitions. Speaking at the Lord Mayor\u0027s Banquet Mansion House in the City of London, he said the UK\u0027s hard power must be strengthened, with billions more spent on new capabilities to tackle drones and cyber attacks.Rory Stewart: Remainer rising star and friend of royals who is not short of confidence                    The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already marriedPenrith MP, 46, is a former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and SussexOld Etonian ex-soldier worked for Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wale sin AfghanistanVoted for Remain and still backs a soft BrexitLeadership odds 161The former prisons minister who once vowed to quit if they did not improve within a year declared his candidacy almost as soon as he was promoted to the Cabinet.He stepped up to International Development Secretary earlier this month to replace Ms Mordaunt and days later declared he will run for the Tory leadership.The Theresa May loyalist praised the PM for her \u0027courageous effort\u0027 to pass her Brexit deal but admitted he would throw his hat in the ring when she steps down.Urging his party not to \u0027try to outdo Nigel Farage\u0027, the development secretary said the Tories should \u0027stretch all the way from Ken Clarke to Jacob Rees-Mogg\u0027.He also lashed out at Mr Johnson at the weekend, saying he would not serve under a No Deal-supporting PM. The Old Etonian former tutor to the Dukes of Cambridge and Sussex previously worked for the Foreign Office in Iraq and set up a charity for the Prince of Wales in Afghanistan.He has also written several books about walking. The father of two is married to Shoshana, whom he first met when they worked together in Iraq and she was already married.   Seen as highly intelligent his staunch Remainer and soft Brexit credentials look likely to count against him in a race set to be dominated by the Brexiteer wing of the party. Matt Hancock: Waffle-loving health secretary who wants Tories to choose a younger leader                    Mr Hancock took stroopwafels in for Cabinet the day after he was pulled up for eating them on televisionThe youngest front-runner at 40A Remainer who now backs Theresa May\u0027s Brexit dealHe wants the party to look to the future and attract younger votersLeadership odds 201The Health Secretary is, like his predecessor Jeremy Hunt, seen as something of a unity candidate.The 40-year-old father of three is seen as a safe pair of hands despite a few teething problems in his latest Cabinet role.Last year he was accused of breaking ethics rules after he praised a private health firm app in a newspaper article sponsored by its maker.But he has since made some hard-hitting interventions in areas like the impact of social media on health. Last month he joined Ms Mordaunt in backing the Generation Why? report showing that the Tories needed to become more relevant to younger voters. He called on the party to change its \u0027tone\u0027 towards modern Britain or face Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister, in a speech widely seen as setting out his leadership credentials.This week he showed his human side by unashamedly chomping calorific stroopwafels before a TV broadcast, saying he people should enjoy things in moderation. Penny Mordaunt: The highly regarded Brexiteer promoted to take on defence                Ms Mordaunt is an outsider for the leadership but is highly thought of in Brexiteer groupsThe MP for Portsmouth North is a Royal Navy reservistHighly regarded in Brexiteer circles She has been consistently tipped to quit over Brexit but remains in the Cabinet Once appeared in a swimsuit in a reality TV show Leadership odds 251 The new Defence Secretary - the first woman ever to hold the post - is highly regarded in Brexiteer circles. The Royal Navy reservist, 46, carved out a niche at International Development with some eye-catching suggests about changing how the UK spends disperses aid cash.She has become an increasingly serious politician after initially being seen as lighthearted when she appeared in a swimsuit in ITV reality TV show Splash!She was promoted earlier this month to replace Gavin Williamson when he was sacked for leaking details from a confidential meeting about Huawei.   Over the preceding few months she was at the heart of persistent rumours that she would be the next Brexit-supporting minister out the door over Brexit. She has yet to announce she is running but last month she backed a thinktank report saying the party needed to attract new voters.She said the party needed to \u0027act swiftly\u0027 to win over the younger generations who were turning away from the centre-Right in \u0027unprecedented\u0027 numbers. On Wednesday, after other Cabinet Brexiteers including Andrea Leadsom were notable by their absence during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, she remained at her post. It remains to be seen whether this loyalty will count for or against her. Sajid Javid: Remainer star who has run into trouble over knife crime and refugees             Sajid Javid has seen his stock take a hit over the knife crime crisis and migrants crossing the English Channel in small boatsThe most senior cabinet contenderVoted Remain but wants to see Brexit deliveredFaced criticism as Home Secretary But has taken a hard line on Shamima Begum case Leadership odds 331The Home Secretary, a Remainer who wants to see Brexit delivered, was the leading candidate from inside the Cabinet to replace Mrs May.After replacing Amber Rudd last year he consciously put clear ground between himself and the Prime Minister on issues like caps on skilled migrants after Brexit.But his credentials have taken a hit recently. He finds himself facing ongoing criticism of his handling of the knife crime crisis affecting UK cities, which sparked a Cabinet row over funding for police.He also lost face over his handling of the influx of migrants crossing the English Channel in January, being seen to move slowly in realising the scale of the problem.But more recently the 49-year-old Bromsgove MP has made a serious of hardline decision designed to go down well with Tory voters. Most notably they have included moving to deprive London teenager turned Jihadi bride Shamima Begum, 19, of her British citizenship, after she was discovered among former Islamic State members in a Syrian refugee camp. Steve Baker: Brexiteer \u0027Spartan\u0027 and self-styled \u0027hardman\u0027 who refused to budge over Brexit               Brexit \u0027hardman\u0027 Steve Baker has previously threatened to leave the Tories over BrexitFormer Brexit minister who resigned last yearA member of the European Research Group which has has opposed Theresa May\u0027s deal in every voteThreatened to quit the Tories over Brexit earlier this yearLeadership odds 331 The High Wycombe MP, 47, is a Brexit purist who has never backed Theresa May\u0027s deal.In March he even threatened to quit the party over the issue, saying: \u0027We\u0027ve been put in this place by people whose addiction to power without responsibility has led them to put the choice of No Brexit or this deal.\u0027I may yet resign the whip than be part of this.\u0027The married former RAF engineer officer described himself as a \u0027hardman\u0027 in a TV interview this year, only to be shown shortly afterwards in a documentary crying in his office.Today he told the BBC: \u0027There is no point shying away from it, people have been asking me to stand. I have had a degree of support from across the country that I could never have foreseen.\u0027I have also had some MPs asking me to stand but I need to face up to the challenge of taking a decision on whether I should do it.\u0027Sir Graham Brady: Backbench kingmaker with an eye on the throne?               The chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs has played a key but neutral role in the downfall of Theresa MayQuit today as chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench MPsHe went into Downing Street today to tell Mrs May time was upBut his name was oddly missing from a later statement on leadership  Leadership odds  501As chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of backbench MPs he has played a key but neutral role in the downfall of Theresa May.But he quit that post after nine years today ahead o a possible run for the top job. Despite being a Brexiteer he has been an independent arbiter, overseeing the no-confidence vote Mrs May survived in December and reportedly opposing attempts to change the rules to dethrone her early.The married father of two has held several meetings with the PM in recent weeks as the mutiny against her grew and this morning saw her in Downing Street where he told her that her time was up.But his name was conspicuously absent from a later Conservative Party statement about how the leadership election would happen. He told the Press Association: \u0027I have been approached by a number of colleagues across the party both inside and outside Parliament asking me to put myself forward as a candidate.\u0027Therefore I have taken the decision to stand down from the position of chairman of the 1922 Committee in order to ensure a fair and transparent election process.\u0027I am considering the approaches I have received and will make a further statement in due course.\u0027His Brexiteer credentials and honourable display as Mrs May was brought down will count in his favour but he lacks frontbench experience, having a sole three-year stint as a shadow Europe minister 15 years ago on his CV. Esther McVey: Former TV presenter and minister who quit Government over Brexit                The former television journalist, is engaged to fellow Tory backbench Brexiteer Philip Davies, 47The 51-year-old was Work and Pensions Secretary until quitting in NovemberShe was a presenter on GMTV before entering politicsIs engaged to fellow Tory MP Philip DaviesThis week launched a \u0027blue collar Conservatism\u0027 project Leadership odds 501 The former Work and Pensions Secretary declared her leadership bid last month and has set out a stall as a right-wing blue-collar candidate from a working class  Liverpudlian background.The former television journalist, is engaged to fellow Tory backbench Brexiteer  Philip Davies, 47, having previously had a romance with ex-minister Ed Vaizey. She has no children.This week she set out her leadership pitch by calling for the party to use £7billion of foreign aid cash on buckling British police forces and schools.Launching a \u0027blue collar conservatism\u0027 campaign the Brexiteer MP, 51, said her party had \u0027lost the trust\u0027 of working people by failing to leave the EU already and must pursue \u0027radical conservative agendas\u0027 to win it back\u0027.She said that keeping cash in the UK that is currently sent abroad would allow an increase of £4billion in spending on schools and £3billion for police, which are both demanding more money.And she declined to rule out doing a post-election deal with Nigel Farage - but said that if the Tories got the UK out it would mean that his Brexit Party would have no reason to exist. Speaking in Westminster she reiterated her call for the next party leader to be \u0027someone who believes in Brexit\u0027 - a dig at Mrs May, who supported the Remain campaign in 2016. Kit Malthouse: Self-proclaimed peacemaker who says it is time for a \u0027new generation\u0027 to take charge Known for his efforts to forge a compromise between Tory Brexit factions Entered the Commons in David Cameron\u0027s 2015 election victory Served as deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London Leadership odds 1001           Kit Malthouse, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative PartyHousing minister Kit Malthouse is best known for his abortive efforts to forge a joint position between Tory Remainers and Brexiteers - which would essentially have meant leaving the EU more slowly but with looser trade ties.It was modestly labelled as the \u0027Malthouse Compromise\u0027.Now the 52-year-old, who was elected to the Commons in 2015, says it is time for a new generation of politicians to take charge of the Conservative Party. Previously the Liverpool-born father-of-three served as a deputy to Boris Johnson when he was Mayor of London. He says his core offer in the contest is a new social contract, \u0027a good job, a secure home and a brilliant school. Job, house, school - the foundations of a secure and happy life\u0027.However, even though Tory leadership contests often throw up surprises, it is unclear whether he will have the support needed to edge out the big beasts.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Australian navy pilots struck lasers South China Sea","story":"Share this article China maintains a robust maritime militia in the South China Sea composed of fishing vessels equipped to carry out missions just short of combat.The waterway between China, Vietnam and Singapore is considered strategic territory and is almost entirely claimed by China who are sensitive to all foreign naval action in the area, especially by the U.S. and allies such as Australia.On Tuesday details of the incident emerged after Euan Graham speculated on the laser sighting in an article for The Strategist, a website run by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an independent, non-partisan think tank based in Canberra.Mr Graham wrote: \u0027It\u0027s hard to say for sure, but similar incidents have occurred in the western Pacific.\u0027  Similar incidents involving lasers and the Chinese military have also been reported as far away as Djibouti, where the U.S. and China have bases. Last year, the U.S. complained to China after lasers were directed at aircraft in the Horn of Africa nation that resulted in minor injuries to two American pilots.

This volume contains one of the largest and earliest surviving groups of his verse – all lovingly transcribed by hand. The volume also contains the work of later poets with at least one unknown poem, making it a testimony to British literary taste over 200 years.’He added: ‘It is crying out for detailed investigation, not least because it also contains clues to the identity of its original, possibly female, compiler who would have been a contemporary of Donne.‘So further research might perhaps shed fresh light on Donne himself and his world.‘I do hope the volume can be kept in this country so that its potential can be realised.’The committee said the export ban could be extended until November if a serious effort to raise the funds is made. "},{"url":null,"title":"Budget adventure tourism firms blamed people dying Mount Everest Colorado man 11th","story":"Share this articleColorado man becomes 11th to die on Everest as experienced mountaineers say climbers putting lives at risk"},{"url":null,"title":"You watch Netflix non stop four years not done","story":"Share this article The watchdog is assessing competition as it decides on the BBC\u0027s proposal to keep shows on iPlayer for one year after they are first shown on TV.

Their destruction, fuelled by rampant consumption and obsession with economic growth, is accelerating.“The evidence is crystal clear: nature is in trouble. Therefore we are in trouble,” declared Sandra Díaz, who co-chaired the completion of a global assessment of bioersity published this week.There is a dual threat to life on Earth: species loss and climate change. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Bioersity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) ranked the main factors causing species loss: changes in land and sea use exploitation of organisms climate change pollution and invasive alien species.These are “eroding the foundations of our economies, livelihoods, food security, health and quality of life worldwide”, and climate breakdown could soon become the main driver.Nature is being destroyed at such a rate that a million species are at risk. On the day the IPBES report made headlines, Dr Allan Mee of the Golden Eagle Trust checked for sightings of the Ring Ouzel in the MacGillycuddy’s Reeks in Co Kerry, one of just two of its remaining habitats in Ireland. “No birds located. Sad but likely witnessing local extinction of the species, once found in 28 Irish counties,” he tweeted. Pádraic Fogarty of the Irish Wildlife Trust replied: “This is mass extinction unfolding before our eyes.”How is the potentially lethal cocktail of bioersity loss and climate disruption going to impact on coming generations in contrasting parts of the globe? Equally, what does it mean for an animal that dominates the Irish landscape (the cow), and the majestic lion, not critically endangered yet rapidly disappearing?The baby born in IrelandConscious of what the next generation is facing, Australian Jim Scheer helped set up the FridaysForFuture climate action movement in Ireland, which is driven by young people. As for the babies of today, “their freedom is limited”, he believes. As a child, “the most I had to worry about was, ‘is there air in the tyres of my bike?’” he says.They are facing a whole different world of realities, a place where the First World problem of “where will I go on my holidays?” may be replaced by “where is my next meal coming from?”The issues weigh heavily on the current generation of young people, he believes, which is why “coming together to grieve” – a feature of recent protests – matters, and is part of telling the truth. There is much frustration too at the inaction of elders.“Uncertain” is the future of that child, says climate activist Dr Lorna Gold. Hope is emerging through the climate movement but, looking at the timelines required for transformational shift, there is “more and more uncertainty”.Children growing up in Ireland will be relatively protected, by location, wealth and assets they will have access to, “but even in the best-case scenario, it will be a diminished world.”This will be due to loss of species and a more complicated world, disrupted by climate and associated conflict, where Dr Gold fears the freedom to explore and travel in relative peace is undermined. It’s a place of learning from the internet rather than real life. The pluses will be better local connectedness with “their own earth” and nearby food production.That Irish child will never hear the corncrake or the curlew, says climatologist Prof John Sweeney, and, as they grow, they will be confronted with hard choices on lifestyle and mobility. The fossil fuel-driven car will be forced out by regulation, he says, but different ways of getting off the island, for example, will be needed if aviation does not overcome its emissions issues.By mid-century, most will live in green cities with an almost total absence of the private car. The transport revolution will be in urban areas but slower to come to the countryside until battery technology improves, Sweeney notes.A near zero-carbon world will mean less air pollution. Clean energy in their home and workplace will mainly come from offshore wind.A downside will be more extreme weather events attributable to climate change more intense storms and rainfall, increased flooding with sea level rises – and yet water shortages in summer.The child born today in Ireland – and the adult they become – will cope far better than their counterpart elsewhere.The developing world babyA baby born today in a developing country, on the other hand, will be at the frontline of climate disruption, says Christian Aid Ireland policy and advocacy adviser Jennifer Higgins. They will have to contend with stronger cyclones, warmer days and nights, more unpredictable rains and longer heatwaves.“Here in Ireland we will have the resources and ability to adapt and deal with these unprecedented weather events, but in many parts of the world, going to Tesco to stock up on sliced pan won’t be a possibility.”They will be the ones who will suffer the worst consequences of our inaction on climate change. “Sustained periods of unseasonably heavy rain can have a damaging impact on agriculture, causing the loss of topsoil and serious nutrient leaching,” says Higgins.In Ireland, save for the odd hosepipe ban, water is always on tap for domestic, industrial and agricultural use. “But in the developing world, where most people depend on agriculture to earn a living or just stay alive, it’s a scarce and precious resource.”Those living in coastal regions will suffer a loss of coral reefs, which half a billion people rely on for fish. For those born among indigenous communities in tropical rainforests, not only will they lose their homeland – already being eroded by increasing industrialisation – but there will be loss of habitat that acts as the lungs of the earth and regulates rainfall.Children will be most susceptible to the increasing diseases that a changing climate will leave in its wake, she adds. Their education may be disrupted when schools are used as shelters when disaster hits their communities.If temperatures increase in already hot areas, it will diminish scarce resources to sustain life and will force many to become refugees.But this may “dwarf numbers caused by conflict or political and economic necessity. When their land becomes uninhabitable because of drought, flood or sea-level rise, they will have to seek a safer place to live,” Higgins predicts.It may be a world where techniques such as conservation agriculture transform crop production and smartphone technology helps drive rural economies backed by deployment of cheap solar PV. But extreme weather events will continue to threaten food production, as seen with recent cyclones in southern Africa.Gold fears a business-as-usual approach means such circumstances can become an intractable problem very quickly, and says solutions are beyond most communities on cost grounds. Therefore the child is facing increased malnutrition, chronic hunger, dependency on external aid, and political instability – an existence marked by inequality and injustice.The IPBES report starkly outlines how indigenous peoples and the poorest are most reliant on land and sea for survival. The combination of land grabs by multinationals facilitated by corrupt governments, extreme climate events and bioersity loss add up to a very bleak future for their offspring, Gold concludes.The future of the cow Humans are not the only beings whose lives will change. The IPBES report emphasises that the effects will be felt first among animals and other living things.In Ireland, there are currently more cattle than people, and they are the most common large animal. For many, the cow (for beef and milk) is the bellwether of Irish agriculture and rural life. For others, it’s the problem because of associated carbon emissions.Teagasc’s head of communications, Eric Donald, says cattle numbers are currently a matter for inidual farmers. With no quotas, no policy instruments are in place. In future we are likely to have fewer beef and more dairy cattle.On emissions, Donald says there is wide acceptance of the need to implement mitigation measures – a process is already in train.Having a grass-based system to feed those cattle will be critical to sustainable farms from an environmental, economic and social perspective, Donald adds. Ireland will need to find export markets for 80 to 90 per cent of its product. Meat consumption may decrease on an inidual basis and there may be a shift to plant-based diets, but increased population growth will mean “demand won’t drop significantly”.But cattle will have to compete for space due to a more erse range of crops, land being used for bioenergy and afforestation (increasingly native woodlands and not just on marginal land) that will act as important carbon sinks, and hedgerows ensuring better bioersity and pollinator capacity.To question beef consumption may currently be an Irish “no-no”, but the reality is the consumers of tomorrow will be confronted by a wide range of new plant and synthetic proteins that will taste surprisingly good and be cheaper, which is likely to mean less red meat is consumed – in line with health guidelines.Eric Donald defends the pursuit of higher genetic quality as a means of increasing efficiency and lowering emissions, especially “because lifetime productivity is better”. With extending grazing seasons, it’s the key measure in improving farm sustainability guidelines. It also complements changes in fertiliser use and slurry management.But John Sweeney says the Irish cow is “reaching limits in terms of genetics”. Like pedigree dogs, they are less able to cope with change and stress compared with native species.Unquestionably, there will be fewer of them, he believes, “if we want to maintain bioersity for future generations”.Expansion in the cattle population has coincided with deterioration in water quality, with widespread glyphosate contamination (one study has found 20 per cent of Irish adults have traces of the herbicide in their urine), nitrates pollution and an emerging ammonia problem.“Continued expansion of the national herd is not compatible with this report. That’s where the crux comes.”The future of the lionJennifer Higgins joins in a lament for so many endangered mammals.Of all species threatened, IWT campaign officer Pádraic Fogarty is shocked by the latest indicators for hippos, giraffes and lions. In particular, “it would be an absolutely travesty if lions were to go extinct . . . The magnificent animal has permeated our culture and imagination, from children’s stories to the pillars on Trafalgar Square.”But maps don’t lie. In 1950 there were 400,000 lions in the wild. Today there are 23,000-39,000 lions in all of Africa, which is “extremely low” in global terms, when once they lived in Ancient Greece and North Africa, and became extinct in Greece only around 100BC.Outside of southern Africa, numbers of lions in 23 unfenced reserves in 11 countries are estimated to have dropped by 62 per cent between 1993 and 2014. Asia is home to a small subpopulation in the Indian state of Gujarat, where numbers are growing, but it’s just a pin on the globe.“There is no data to say that lions are about to disappear, but their populations are shrinking fast,” he explains. The species is classified as vulnerable but the slide into the “endangered” and then “critically endangered” categories looms, while “threatened with extinction” is applied to its current status.For Fogarty, the same pressures apply to other mammals, but the lion’s wellbeing is further undermined by gametrophy hunting and false western-world notions that it is somehow good for population numbers. All told, we are facing a scenario where lions will “shrink to a few corners of the planet”.What to doThis is not going to be sorted by putting bird tables in back gardens. The Ipbes report shows nature-based solutions can help bring “transformative change”, but there is a greater systemic problem.In the past 50 years, the human population has doubled, the global economy has grown nearly four-fold, and global trade has grown tenfold, together driving up the demands for energy, food and materials.Thinking that endless economic growth is possible and not valuing the essential services provided by nature is a delusion leading to catastrophe, Sweeney believes.“Until we get away from euros and cents and GDP, we will be in a cul-de-sac . . . Unless we rethink how we value the services provided by the natural world and include them explicitly in a wellbeing measure, we delude ourselves that a sustainable future is possible.”That was the core message in a submission this week to EU leaders meeting on the future of Europe by the European Environmental Bureau (EEB) and more than 200 academics, including John Sweeney, policy experts and civil society groups.There is an onus too on iniduals to act, according to EEB vice president Attracta Uí Bhroin. “It’s not enough for us to sit on the sofa and watch David Attenborough’s latest breathtaking and terrifying documentary and shake our heads. Every politician coming near your front door needs to know environmental sustainability is your priority, and must be Europe’s priority.”Fogarty hopes people now see the connections between climate breakdown and mass extinction, that they are two sides of the same coin. “We have all of the solutions to hand, but what we’ve been lacking is any sense of urgency to get on with it.”He senses momentum moving in the right direction, though the lack of a response from the Taoiseach or any Government minister “makes me feel that they are still hoping it’s an issue that will go away. We can’t really afford this level of disengagement when we need to be getting on with things.”Scheer is brutally frank about future voters born today. “I don’t think people get a choice of what games they play.”They will have to be focused on survival. “It feels as we have handed them a shitstorm.”As for the current generation, too many are stuck in business-as-usual mode. There is a need to raise consciousness quickly. “Ignorance is not a choice” given the IPBES report. “It’s not an opinion, it’s scientific. It’s happening.”Kevin O\u0027Sullivan is Environment and Science Editor and former Editor of The "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907493.1559065706!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a day in the phoenix park it feels like the most peaceful place on earth","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDublin Zoo in the Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeThe sky is still a murky grey when there is a flash of yellow Lycra among the trees, the first sign of the early-morning runners who pound the pavements and grass of the Phoenix Park each day.The park’s famous deer are nowhere to be seen. Soon, Chesterfield Avenue, the spine of the park, yet again becomes a bustling throughway, with lorries squeezing through the main gate cars overtaking cyclists and cyclists overtaking electric scooters.More than 20 gardeners look after the park, arriving at 8am each day. Working here is no chore, says head gardener Meeda Downey: “Different things crop up. It doesn’t feel like you are coming to work at all.“The public are very appreciative too. They come up and tell you what a great job you’re doing. It puts you in a good mood,” she says, though she emphasises that where they can, they leave nature to its own devices to encourage bioersity.Shortly after 10am, the first busload of tourists pulls up in the park, for a welcome break from congested roads. Driver and tour guide Bill Dunne (50) slows, letting passengers take snaps of the Wellington Monument and “ooh” and “aah” at the deer.Dunne, who is from the Liberties, has been slowing down the Hop-On Hop-Off bus for Áras photos and the park’s other attractions for nearly 14 years, but he never tires of it.“Dublin is soaked in history, so it’s not too difficult bringing the ‘céad mile fáilte’ every day,” Dunnes says. His boisterous charm is appreciated by his passengers, who have started referring to him as the “leprechaun on steroids”.Americans are particularly keen on the park, surprised by the resemblance between Áras an Uachtaráin and the White House. Quickly setting them straight, Dunne says: “I tell them the White House resembles the Áras. Ours was built first, and that’s very important.”Three-year-old Lili Deleo, who lives in nearby Chapelizod, visits the park almost every day with her father, Niall Deleo (42), and their dog, Bob.“We just love it here,” says Niall. “She gets to see nature, the deer and play with other kids.” However, he worries that the Office of Public Works’ consultation threatens to “commercialise” the park. “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” he believes, though he would prefer less traffic on Chesterfield Avenue.In Dublin Zoo, three-year-old Teddy McCann is restless with anticipation as he waits to see the “big gorilla”. He has been here many times before, says his grandmother, Diane Nelson, but the excitement never wanes.“We usually get him an annual pass for his birthday. He gets the monthly magazine so he gets very excited about coming to see the animals,” she says.Dublin hurler Conal Keaney (36), of Phoenix Park Bikes, has supplied bicycles to visitors for six years. Overseas people come in their droves, though Mr Keaney believes that many more Irish could take advantage of “the beauty on their doorstep”.Despite working long days, he remains in awe of the park: “No day is ever the same. We are meeting people from all over the world,” he says. “To be out here surrounded by squirrels and birds ... It’s a real privilege.”By evening the park has become home to the cricketers in the Phoenix Park Cricket Club, which has used a plot in the east of the grounds for 200 years – one that is the envy of many of their rivals, says Birmingham-born coach Stephen Moreton.“To have this as a place where kids of five or six can enjoy and stay on until they are 85 or 95 years old, as many of our members are, is just wonderful,” he says. “When you are here it feels like the most peaceful place on earth,” he says."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907457.1559063523!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"big plans for phoenix park doing nothing was not an option","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMax and Molly Rooney playing football in front of Áras an Uachtaráin in Phoenix Park. Photograph: James FordeVisitors to Dublin’s Phoenix Park had been happily motoring along – literally, for the most part – until suddenly they were hit with the news that the 360-year-old park, the largest enclosed park of any European capital city, was facing change.Change to beloved cultural institutions or amenities of any sort is generally deeply unpopular, but talk of funicular railways, driverless shuttles or “road trains” caught many park users like its famed deer in headlights.The Office of Public Works (OPW) is undertaking a strategic review of the visitor experience provided by the park, and such is the public interest, it extended the public consultation period, which had been due to end on April 26th, until Friday, May 31st.While the more ambitious projects, such as the repurposing of the Magazine Fort on Military Road as a visitor attraction – with the possible addition of the funicular railway, the construction of glowing “welcome pavilions” and the expansion of the Ashtown visitor centre – have attracted the most attention, the overarching principle is to improve facilities, OPW chief park superintendent Margaret Gormley says.“The 1,752 acres of the Phoenix Park are cherished by Dubliners and visitors alike, but in some ways it is a victim of its own successes. Some of its infrastructure is creaking at the seams, and the OPW came to the conclusion that to safeguard the park for the future the ‘do nothing’ scenario was not an option.”The OPW wants to redevelop the current Ashtown Demesne cafe as a children’s education centre and build a larger cafe and visitor centre, as well as allowing for extensive car-parking facilities.Magazine FortThe second major project would be the restoration of the Magazine Fort, built in 1736 to store gunpowder and ammunition for British army. The plan envisages exhibition facilities, a shop and cafe, a rampart walk and moat walk, with potential for a funicular railway to pull passengers up the steep hill from Chapelizod Road.“This has the potential to make a connection with the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge at the point where a new bridge will be built across Liffey,” Gormley says, “but also to act as a hub for a historical military trail in this part of the city linking to the Grangegorman military cemetery and Arbour Hill.”The strategic review, drafted by Denis Byrne Architects for the OPW, makes proposals for five distinct areas of the park. In addition to the biggest projects at the Ashtown centre and the Magazine Fort, it proposes a “welcome quarter” at the Parkgate Street entrance, with twin pavilions acting as visitor information centres, which “may also glow in the evenings, as lanterns, to summon people, perhaps out of an autumn drizzle”.At the west end of the park, which takes in Fury Glen and the White Fields, a “bioersity quarter” with an interpretive centre could be developed, along with more toilets and an upgraded picnic area with a possible “organised” barbecue space. Barbecues, although a frequent occurrence – particularly on either side of the largely traffic-free Furze Road – are currently banned in the park.Finally, the strategy considers Chesterfield Avenue, the central traffic artery through the park. This could be dotted with playgrounds and temporary and permanent art installations and outdoor exhibitions, but what will probably attract most attention is the proposal for a “driverless shuttle” bus or “road train” carrying 15 passengers at a time. A train station on the underground Phoenix Park rail line that runs from Heuston Station could also be developed on the north side of Chesterfield Avenue, close to the zoo.Rewilding the parkThere has been some disquiet about the level of intervention proposed and concentration on tourist facilities in the review. The Green Party has called for a move away from construction in favour of “rewilding” the park, so it can remain a natural resource, particularly in a city that needs to promote more high-density living.However, architect Denis Byrne says this is a misconception of the nature, purpose and origins of the park.“The Phoenix Park is a very complex organism certain parts are wild, but certain parts are incredibly ornamental. There is a vast range of landscapes. It was originally a royal hunting park, so even its wilderness was a curated and carefully planned wilderness.”The review document represents “a bit of blue-sky thinking” rather than a “set of rules” for how the park must be developed, he says.In preparation for the review his firm studied how parks have developed in other cities, such as in London, Sydney and New York, while the idea of the funicular railway was inspired by Lisbon and the driverless shuttles are already in use in the Bois de Vincennes in Paris. However, Mr Byrne says, a mobility plan for the park could throw up other innovative ideas.“Who would have thought electric-powered scooters would suddenly be so popular –maybe they’ll be a way of getting around the park.”‘Soulless retail units’Local residents have raised concerns about the more commercial-heavy plans, with the Navan Road Community Council in particular opposing what it says will be “large, expensive, soulless retail units” at the Ashtown and Magazine Fort centres, which will require “an abundance of car-parking spaces”, it says. “Once areas of the park vanish under concrete they can never be returned.”The OPW shares the concerns about traffic in the park, Gormley says, and would like to develop more sustainable transport options such as the shuttle buses and, eventually, a station, but she says in the short to medium term, given the size of the park, and its use as a commuter route, traffic needs to be managed rather than eliminated.She stresses that the bioersity of the park will remain paramount. “There are no plans to change the ethos or the ambiance of the park, but you can retain those aspects and have good-quality toilets.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Exit of 119 staff in 2018 largest in nearly decade as report on pay to be consideredDetails will be published in mid-June as part of the Summer Economic StatementIranian national (42) and three other murdered men linked to Finglas-based drug gangTaoiseach says many would agree with Minister, ahead of his talk with Maria BaileyGarda\u0026iacute believe the victim was probably shot by associates in a drugs gang based in FinglasScience world marks 100th anniversary of test which provided first evidence of relativityTourists spot deer, a child waits for \u0026lsquothe big gorilla\u0026rsquo and a \u0026lsquoleprechaun on steroids\u0026rsquo drives a busSome 20,000 affected as intercity trains halted for two hours, commuter services for fourOverall fall comes despite recruitment drive for Army, Navy and Air CorpsA Wexford fisherman went missing from the Ellie Adhlamh early last Friday morningAgnes Thomas tells court in Paris she warned her friend against meeting \u0026lsquoweird guy\u0026rsquoMinister makes pointed criticism of compo culture as FG throw Maria Bailey under busDublin: Daly on way to Brussels after securing third seat, leaving Andrews in \u0026lsquocold storage\u0026rsquo until BrexitTributes paid by family, friends and colleagues to decorated officer David HearneAssessment of foster family after abuse disclosure \u0026lsquoinadequate\u0026rsquo, says review panelGarda\u0026iacute believe shooting linked to murder of Sean Little last weekIndependent Turlough McGovern receives highest number of first preference votesMinister of State John Paul Phelan confirms move after majority of voters back proposalDriver was in car with his three children when it collided with an articulated truckLandlord changed two-bedroom apartment to three-bedroom out of greed, says judge"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3907625.1559074133!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"defence forces losing staff at increasing rate","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIrish Army Ranger wing in Chad in 2008.

Mr Donohoe will also outline how much money he will expect to be able to spend in 2020 if there is an orderly Brexit.Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on October 31st, and candidates for the Tory leadership contest, the winner of which will replace Theresa May as prime minister, are pledging they will leave the EU without a deal at that point if they cannot secure changes to the withdrawal agreement, including the backstop.European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker repeated yesterday that the deal cannot be reopened.While work is said to be only beginning on calculating how a no-deal Brexit would affect the budget, sources said the money available to Mr Donohoe would be “vastly reduced”.One Government figure also said Fine Gael must show it has control of the public finances after controversies over the national children’s hospital and the National Broadband Plan.Growing riskSpeaking in Brussels yesterday, Mr Varadkar said there was “a growing risk of no deal”.“There is a possibility that the new British prime minister may try to repudiate the withdrawal agreement,” he said.In the summer statement last year Mr Donohoe said there would be €3.4 billion available in the budget, although corporation tax receipts increased the total by a further €1 billion by budget day in October.Mr Donohoe has already said a no-deal Brexit could make the unemployment rate rise by 2 per cent, as well as making the economy 4.5 per cent smaller in the medium term than it would be under existing projections.Mr Varadkar told his Independent colleagues in Government he would inform them if he chooses to dissolve the Dáil early for a general election.He reassured his Ministers at a Cabinet meeting on Monday that it was not his intention to give the impression in weekend comments that he favoured an election soon.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireSitting Fine Gael MEP and former GAA president Seán Kelly has already been elected, describing his poll-topping performance as “probably the greatest moment of my political career”.As the distribution of transfers continues, Mr Wallace had 88,759 votes by the 13th count. Mr Kelleher was on 87,964.Mr Wallace said that he was “amazed” at the reception he received on the doors had translated in to votes. He believed his “talking straight” persona resonated with voters. Mr Wallace admitted he was not very familiar with the transfer system, having only been in count centres for his previous elections for a few minutes. Meanwhile, sitting Sinn Féin MEP Liadh Ní Riada and Green Party Senator Grace O’Sullivan are in fourth and fifth place, with 83,891 and 80,708 votes respectively.They are followed by Fianna Fáil’s Cllr Malcolm Byrne on 72,853 and sitting Fine Gael MEP Deirdre Clune on 67,896.It is expected that the Ireland South Election will conclude in the early hours of Thursday morning at the earliest. Kelly received 119,444 first preference votes but had to wait an excruciating 24 hours to cross the finish line from the announcement of the first count results. Ms Daly secured the third seat on Tuesday with a final total of 87,770 votes and Mr Andrews the fourth seat with 68,952.Green Party candidate Ciaran Cuffe and Fine Gael’s Frances Fitzgerald took the first and second seats respectively on Monday.Sinn Féin’s Lynn Boylan was eliminated from the Dublin European Parliament constituency after the 15th count. Ms Daly said she was “gobsmacked” by the response she received “from every corner of this city”.In a speech in the RDS after her election, she said: “I want to assure those people, many of whom are hurting and let badly down by our political system, that I intended to use the voice in Europe as I have used the voice in Dublin Fingal to be an advocate, a speaker-out for change and to rattle the cages of those in authority.”She said her team had conducted their campaign on a “shoe-string budget, with a raggle-taggle mob of Independents 4 Change staff.”Ms Daly also paid tribute to Ms Boylan, describing her as an “exceptionally good” MEP. “I’m very sorry to lose her, I’m very glad to see that transfers amongst the left carry through on this election, it is the way of the future. We will face that in a general election, which I hope will be very soon.”Following a row marked by the suspension of the count on Monday night, it was decided to distribute Ms Boylan’s votes instead of automatically electing the remaining two candidates.This was done in order to determine who would take the third seat and the fourth seat.This is important because the fourth seat is effectively in limbo due to the Brexit impasse, and Mr Andrews will not able to take it until the UK leaves the European Union.Meanwhile, Mr Andrews, who took the fourth seat, said it was satisfying that a Fianna Fáil MEP would be returned for Dublin, adding that he would consider what to do for the next few months until the UK leaves the EU.“I see Brexit as a disaster for this island. You don’t have to study it to understand what a negative impact it will have. But if Brexit does happen I’m ready to serve in the European Parliament.”He said he understood there were more than 50 MEPs across the EU in a similar situation to his. Mr Andrews said there was confusion around how the electoral counts would work for those in “cold-storage” and said it was time for an electoral commission.In Midlands North West, there is still no sign of a second MEP being elected. Independent MEP Luke Ming Flanagan was the closest to the finish line with 90,187 after count eight, followed by Sinn Féin’s Matt Carthy on 81,544 and Fine Gael’s Maria Walsh on 72,265.Peter Casey took 1,124 transfers on the eighth count and on 60,759 remained ahead of the Green Party’s Saoirse McHugh, with 55,455.They were trailed by Fianna Fáil pair Brendan Smith, with 44,836, and Anne Rabbitte, with 32,041.Independent Fidelma Healy Eames faced elimination on the ninth count last night.On Monday, Ms McGuinness was the first of 13 Irish MEPs elected. The 59-year-old sitting MEP, first elected to the European Parliament in 2004, received 134,630 first-preference votes, exceeding the quota by some 16,000 votes in the four-seater constituency.Ms Walsh, a former Rose of Tralee, took more than 6,000 of Mairead McGuinness’ first preference vote.All 949 seats have been filled in the local elections, with Longford County Council finally declaring results after four days of counting. The Green Party was the big winner having recorded its best election results to date while Sinn Féin was the big loser. Sinn Féin lost seats on councils all over the country – and was wiped out on some local authorities – in a big reversal of fortunes compared to the last such elections five years ago.The party has seen its councillors fall from 159 in 2014 to 81.Earlier, the Minister responsible for electoral reform admitted he had become confused about the legal rules as they applied to the Dublin Euro count.Minister of State for Electoral Reform John Paul Phelan said on RTÉ’s Today with Seán O’Rourke show he had made a mistake in earlier comments about the legislation.He said, initially, that Ms Boylan’s votes should be excluded before clarifying his remarks. “It will be necessary to redistribute them...apologies for my misunderstanding...I doubted myself last night when I was reading the reports, mostly on social media, about what had happened. “In order to determine the positioning of candidates that has to be done for the first time in this particular European election.”Full profiles and in depth analysis of the European election"},{"url":null,"title":"longford county council four days of counting finally produces results","story":"After four full days of counting, Longford County Council’s 18 seats were finally filled on Tuesday night – the last count centre in the country to declare results.Fianna Fáíl’s Joe Flaherty was elected on Sunday in the Longford electoral area on the first count after securing 1,053 first preference votes.He was followed by Fine Gael’s Peggy Nolan, Gerry Hagan and John Browne, Fianna Fáil’s Séamus Butler and Martin Monaghan, alongside Independent Gerry Warnock.The main talking point in the Granard local electoral area was the performance of first-time Independent candidate Turlough McGovern.

They are also able to play music to various speakers at once over WiFi rather than Bluetooth, through Apple\u0027s AirPlay 2 feature.Apple has worked to bring a whole host of wireless audio features to its iPhones, especially since dropping the headphone jack and instead focusing on products like the AirPods, which send music over the air.Similar tools include the AirPods\u0027 live listen feature, which allows the phone\u0027s microphones to listen in to sound and then transmit that to the wireless earbuds.The AirPods – and the similar Powerbeats Pro – also include Apple chips that make them quick to swap between different devices that are being used by the same person.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The 128GB version costs $299 and the 256GB one costs $399.The last time the iPod Touch was updated was in 2015, when Apple also added upgraded new components to make sure it could still use its latest software.Since July 2017, when Apple quietly killed off the iPod Nano and Shuffle, the Touch is the only iPod in Apple\u0027s line-up.It seems to have stuck around because it is the only one of the iPods that ever had an internet connection and Apple\u0027s iOS software, allowing it to use services like Apple Music. The company has largely moved away from personal music libraries and songs being stored on computers and iPods, instead encouraging users to sign up for streaming music, as part of a more general move towards services.But old versions of the iPod are still around, and continue to be supported by Apple. They remain one of the problems with the company completely overhauling iTunes and focusing on Apple Music, since the software is still the way that those iPods can be synced with computers and music can be put onto them.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

David Barnett reports\u0026nbspClick to followThe IndependentJoy Division: (left to right) Ian Curtis, Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Peter HookIt’s a big year for fans of Joy Division and New Order. This summer marks 40 years since the former’s debut album Unknown Pleasures, their only LP released before the suicide of lead singer Ian Curtis, aged 23, in May 1980. The surviving members – bassist Hook, guitarist Bernard “Barney” Sumner and drummer Stephen Morris – transformed themselves into New Order that year, joined by Gillian Gilbert on keyboards, with Sumner taking over vocals. It’s 30 years since the band released Technique. It was their their fifth album, but the one that propelled them to the top of the charts and into proper stardom, influenced by the Balearic sound of house music.Everybody, it seems, has a Joy Division or New Order story to tell, as evidenced by the books released this year. Jon Savage’s This Searing Light, the Sun and Everything Else is an “oral history” of Joy Division, published by Faber in April. Drummer Stephen Morris has his memoirs, Record Play Pause, out this month. Dave Haslam, one-time DJ at Manchester’s Hacienda club, the focal point of the so-called Madchester scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s, mentions his love of both bands in his recent autobiography, Sonic Youth Slept On My Floor.“Hooky”, you might be unsurprised to hear, doesn’t have a lot of truck with any of them. We meet in a Costa in Alderley Edge, a leafy little town in Cheshire, only 20 miles away, geographically, from Salford, where Hooky and Bernard Sumner grew up, but half a world away in other respects.He’s lived here for 20 years, and as we find a quiet corner of the coffee shop, I mention in passing that I took my 14-year-old daughter to listen to Haslam reading from his book a few weeks ago. “Well, when she grows up she’ll never forgive you,” he says.Created with Sketch.Caught on film: Joy Division on tour in 1979 Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Hooky perhaps has a reputation for abrasiveness, for speaking his mind, for not taking any crap. He and New Order parted ways in 2007 and don’t appear to be on good terms. I mention that Haslam had spoken fondly of him, which he finds hard to believe. Has he read Haslam’s book?“I haven’t read many good Manchester books,” he says. “I think my favourite is Bez’s. I’ve got Mark E Smith’s on my shelf but not got round to it yet.”Peter Hook to perform Joy Division albums in full at UK showsJoy Division’s Bernard Sumner’s memoir recalls the death of bandmateHooky himself wrote Unknown Pleasures: Inside Joy Division, published in 2012, and he says he did so as a direct response to the author and journalist Mick Middles’ 1996 book, From Joy Division to New Order. “That Middles book was a crock of f**king shit but he inspired me to write my own,” he says. “I suppose I’m in the unenviable position of being too close to the whole thing.”I wave Jon Savage’s book at him and he shakes his head. “That is particularly annoying that one, it’s Joy Division in their own words but a lot of it’s just lifted from when we did the Joy Division documentary. Those interviews were from the Control interview, Faber bought them lock stock and barrel without our permission, without even a f**king charity donation. He had access to the whole transcripts. Didn’t make sense to me, especially from Jon Savage who you’ve known for 40 f**king years. We weren’t party to how it was done in any way shape or form so it’s just another annoyance.”Does a lot of stuff annoy Peter Hook generally? He shrugs. “It’s not that bad after a while. You just get used to it. You get to that bit where nothing surprises you. I mean, I’ve had a few fracas with Jon because he sided with them lot and excluded me which I felt was really unfair, especially when I used to tow his f**king car back so our kid could fix it. So yeah… people have short memories.”There’s a chapter in Dave Haslam’s book where he details being commissioned by NME to interview New Order, a band of which he describes himself as “a devotee, bewitched by them”. Haslam interviewed the band in 1986 at their recording studio in Cheetham Hill afterwards, Hooky gave him a lift back into Manchester city centre. Haslam had taped the interview but something went wrong his tape was blank. In a panic, he sat down in a cafe and tried to write down everything again from memory, commenting:\u0026nbsp“No one knew how I’d crafted the quotes by New Order.”Tales grow in the telling. Legends get embellished. Stories take on a life of their own. “Yeah,” concedes Hooky. In 2010 he wrote a book called The Hacienda: How Not to Run a Club, and says he initially wanted to do it on interviews with the principal characters. “What I found which was really weird, when I started talking to a few people I very quickly realised that everybody had a different memory of the single occasion, so I thought f**k this, I’m going to have to do it on my own. And you find even though you think something is true you can be contradicted by people.”As an example, Hooky cites his auctioning off earlier this year of all his old Joy Division and New Order memorabilia, to raise money for the Epilepsy Society (Ian Curtis suffered from it) and Calm, the charity aimed at tackling suicide, especially among men. He put a bell tree percussion device in the lots, saying it had been used on the Joy Division track Atmosphere. Drummer Stephen Morris, who would have used it, disputed the fact.Hooky says, “I think you’d have to be deaf not to realise that a bell tree made the sound and it wasn’t a tambourine stuck on a pair of scissors. But that is an example of how people can remember completely different things. Normally it doesn’t lead to that level of aggro but it is quite shocking really because there is no truth, the only truth really is your truth. You’re not gonna lie. I’m sure Stephen Morris thinks it was but, y’know, in my opinion he’s wrong, and you have to go with your own truth otherwise you’d never get through life. It is interesting the way you can have completely different ideas.”V97 with Monaco (PA)There’s a sense when talking to Peter Hook that his often cutting remarks about the people he’s shared some of the last 40-odd years with are, in a way, a defensive tactic, that there’s been so many wars of words since New Order split that he’s getting his jabs in first. At one point I ask him what would happen if Bernard Sumner walked into the Costa we were sitting in, and he laughs uproariously and says, “You’d need your camera, mate!”But it’s obvious he loves the music. He’s rarely been without a band or project since he started while New Order were still going he worked with another Factory band, Ad Infinitum. When New Order had their first break-up in 1993, he started two new bands, Revenge and Monaco. New Order reformed for almost a decade from 1998, during which time Hooky began to develop his DJing career, which now sees him about to embark on a tour with Hacienda Classical, kicking off on 8 June at Scarborough’s Open Air Theatre.Classical accompaniment to pop and dance music is something of a thing right now, but this is the fifth year of the Hacienda Classical concept, which combines the live orchestral music of the Manchester Camerata with DJs recreating the sounds of the nightclub’s heyday. If you think that sounds a bit weird, then you wouldn’t be on your own.Camerata Orchestra performing Hacienda Classical (Rex)The idea had been pioneered by DJ Todd Terry in the States, and British DJ Pete Tong had started doing it over here. “Pete Tong was doing it more as a concert, songs finishing and starting. Graeme’s idea was to do it as a DJ mix, just the same as it would be in a club, so once you started you didn’t stop,” says Hooky.That caused some problems with some venues because they wanted an intermission in which to make up the takings on the bar. “But we felt it was more intrinsic to the spirit of the Hacienda to be complete it starts and it finishes, you’re f**ked and you go home and you recover. It was that depth of feeling that you wanted from what we were doing.”The orchestra plays live and the sound is mixed by the DJ in to the classic Hacienda club tracks, with live vocalists. Hooky gets a bit of fire in his eyes that’s impossible to fake just for PR purposes as he waxes lyrical over the gigs. “A lot of these songs you’ve grown up with and they’ve marked many, many special occasions in your life… death, kids, meeting the missus, losing the missus … it’s very charged, it’s very physical, and people f**king love it. And it gives all us old people the excuse to live our youth again, get a babysitter, have the kids tucked up at home, and fearing what you’re going to feel like the next morning.”Hooky started DJing in 2004, doing it full time in 2007 when New Order split for the second time. He says, “I started doing it out of necessity because I had no money at that point, as New Order we’d not worked for a bit. I mainly do dance music and I get in a lot of trouble because everybody expects you to play the f**king Stone Roses and the Happy Mondays ad infinitum.Madchester’ hub\u0026nbsp(Rex)“The other fantastic thing is most DJs are sober and they’re always on time, which is f**king fantastic. If I’m on at 9 o’clock I know the DJ before me will finish at 8.59.59. You play with groups and they’re always f**king late, nobody arguing about who goes on last and all that crap. It’s very courteous. The rivalry comes with you wanting to play a better set.”So he’s looking forward to hitting the road with the Hacienda Classical Tour, which takes in the Royal Albert Hall and the Isle of Wight Festival among its dates. But Hooky has a special soft spot for the tour opener, Scarborough.“Scarborough is a great place,” he enthuses. “I DJ’d in that old place on the pier the last time I was there. They were nuts. And I never realised how beautiful Scarborough was. Scarborough actually reminded me insanely of Palma, Majorca. I couldn’t believe how beautiful it was. All that European money, innit? And they won’t be getting that any more.”Ah, here it is. We look at each other cautiously over our coffee cups. Ageing rock stars and Brexit. You never know how that one’s going to pan out, do you? Morrissey calling the referendum result “magnificent” and Johnny Rotten in a “make America great again” T-shirt.“Look,” says Hooky, who lives in Majorca for half the year and has ambitions to do that full-time. “I’m a traveller. I go all round the world all the time and I do think it’s important in this day and age for us all to stick together, and not to be fragmented. I think that’s the worst thing that could happen to anybody and I think it exacerbates differences and things like immigration and racism.“I just think it’s the wrong way of pursuing a modern life. It’s old-fashioned, and honestly if you found someone who still thought it was a good idea then they’re a f**king idiot because it’s been proved that our government can’t handle it, which is an embarrassment. I was sat there last week doing a Euro news interview and the guy’s going, ‘What’s happening with Brexit?’ and I haven’t a f**king clue but there’s one thing I do know that if I was doing my job as shit as them I’d be stood on me own in a concert hall. There’d be no audience, right, and that’s what makes me laugh about it. Our government is selfish, it’s only interested in power, personal power, personal politics, and the country is just an absolute f**king embarrassment.”He pauses, then shakes his head and adds, “David Cameron should be torn apart by an angry mob. Theresa May had\u0026nbspthe balls to try to stay in office and say I’ll see it out, not like that shithouse.”Though DJing with the Hacienda Classical tour will dominate this summer, Hooky does of course still keep his bass arm working, primarily with Peter Hook and The Light. That started in 2010, around the 30th anniversaryof Ian Curtis’s death, the same year he opened a new nightclub, The Factory, in the old\u0026nbspoffices of Factory Records\u0026nbspin Manchester. The Light performs Joy Division and New Order tracks, as they were meant to be heard, faithfully following the order of the songs on the albums.“I literally only booked one gig, which was at The Factory, and it was supposed to be a one-off celebration and we ended up doing two nights and we started getting loads of interest,” he recalls. “We hadn’t booked anything until we played, it all came out as a result of that and it was wonderful. I’d not played Joy Division songs for 30 years ... to actually start playing them was absolutely fantastic because we hardly ever did them as New Order.”According to Hooky, New Order “buried Joy Division along with Ian”, and they would only very occasionally revisit the old stuff, such as when manager Rob Gretton asked them to play Love Will Tear Us Apart “because it’s f**king so-and-so’s birthday”. He says, “I think we played in our whole career of New Order about three Joy Division songs.”That changed in 2006 when New Order played the first Manchester Versus Cancer gig, an initiative set up by Andy Rourke of The Smiths. They played a full set of Joy Division tunes. “It was absolutely fantastic, it was delightful, absolutely delightful to do,” says Hooky. “But I don’t think Barney liked doing it and I understand that. He wanted to do his own lyrics, he wanted to do his own songs, which makes perfect sense. But it was a frustration, because you’re sort of given something back for a moment and then it’s snatched off you again.But Hooky had developed a taste for performing the Joy Division songs he hadn’t played for 30 years, and The Light was born. In May 2020 The Light will perform the two Joy Division albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer, in full, at the Manchester Apollo and the Brixton Academy. Again, they will be benefiting the Epilepsy Society and Calm. It will be 40 years, almost to the day, since Ian Curtis died.Without taking anything away from any of the musicians Hooky has worked with (his own son Jack has played with Monaco and The Light), I wonder if it wouldn’t just be simpler – and more satisfying for fans – to get the old band back together again to play these classic songs?We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?Hooky thinks for a long moment before musing, “With any group you’re always going to get a problem if the members of the group don’t get on. Look at The Smiths the only two that make most money out of it are Morrissey and Marr. It’s a great shame.”I wonder out loud what The Smiths would be like if they were still together as a band today. Hooky looks at me. “Well, what would New Order be like if they were going today?”And could that be a thing?“What happened at the end of New Order was that Bernard and I had completely different ideas about the group, the music, the attitude to business, and they were that far apart,” he says holding his hands wide. “And the only thing in the middle was Stephen. I had the opinion that Steve agreed with me and then found out afterwards that he seemed to agree with Bernard so I’m looking forward to his book for an explanation of that.“Then they reformed behind my back, and licensed the assets to themselves. Which is not exactly the most honourable thing to do but...” He shrugs. “It’s survival.”There was a long-running court case over Hook’s claim of lost royalties after the band’s “restructuring”, which was settled out of court in 2017. Bernard Sumner, Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert continue under the name New Order.Three decades since Technique, 40 years since Unknown Pleasures. Next year will be the 40th anniversary\u0026nbspof Ian Curtis’s death. Is there any change of a reconciliation on the horizon at all? Over the course of the interview, Hooky seems to have mellowed away from his initial defensive-offensive tactic of getting his attacks in first, albeit done with wry humour as they were. Now he seems almost reflective.“You asked me earlier what would happen if Barney walked in here,” he says. “We’re just a bunch of old men who are arguing, and we seem happy to keep doing that. But I do feel more and more that... well, life’s just too short, isn’t it?”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Early hominins in northeast Africa had to learn to walk on two legs to cross these vast areas, according to the study, published in the Journal of Geology.The theory was laid out by a team led by physicist Professor Adrian Melott\u0026nbspin an attempt to join together different strands of research.\u0026nbsp“It is thought there was already some tendency for hominins to walk on two legs, even before this event. But they were mainly adapted for climbing around in trees,” he said.Created with Sketch.The most incredible space images of Earth Show all 30Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Explore ESA astronaut Tim Peake\u0027s stunning photos of Earth, taken from the International Space Station during his six month mission (captions by Tom Peake)Every day spent living in space is a great day, but today was particularly special.

No prizes for guessing where this is…From one mighty ocean to another – ships passing through the Panama canal“After this conversion to savannah, they would much more often have to walk from one tree to another across the grassland, and so they become better at walking upright. They could see over the tops of grass and watch for predators.”Professor Melott arrived at this hypothesis by drawing on research about historic supernovae and evidence for the impact they had on Earth. Ancient seabed deposits of iron-60 isotopes – radioactive forms of iron – provided a crucial clue.‘Neanderthal-like’ teeth reveal early human evolution in EuropeEarly human evolution was ‘multi-ethnic and multicultural’Homo erectus: Early humans were able to speak and crossed sea on boatsProfessor Melott\u0026nbspsaid these materials must\u0026nbsphave arrived on Earth from a supernova, which would have exploded 163 light years away during the transition from the Pliocene Epoch to the Ice Age.“We calculated the ionisation of the atmosphere from cosmic rays which would come from a supernova about as far away as the iron-60 deposits indicate,” he\u0026nbspsaid.“We contend it would increase the ionisation of the lower atmosphere by 50-fold. Usually, you don’t get lower-atmosphere ionisation because cosmic rays don’t penetrate that far, but the more energetic ones from supernovae come right down to the surface – so there would be a lot of electrons being knocked out of the atmosphere.”They suggest ionisation in the lower atmosphere meant there were more pathways for lightning strikes which led to widespread fires.Professor Melott also said he believed his\u0026nbsptheory was supported by the discovery of carbon deposits in soils at around the same time as this cosmic-ray bombardment was happening.\u0026nbsp“The observation is that there’s a lot more charcoal and soot in the world starting a few million years ago. It’s all over the place, and nobody has any explanation for why it would have happened all over the world in different climate zones. This could be an explanation,” he\u0026nbspsaid.\u0026nbsp“That increase in fires is thought to have stimulated the transition from woodland to savannah in a lot of places – where you had forests, now you had mostly open grassland with shrubby things here and there.”Professor Melott said no similar event was expected to happen any time soon. The nearest star capable of exploding into a supernova in the next million years is Betelgeuse, which is 652 light years from Earth.\u0026nbsp“Betelgeuse is too far away to have effects anywhere near this strong,” he\u0026nbspsaid.At the end of last year Professor Melott led another study that found supernovae 2.6 million years ago could have swept Earth’s prehistoric oceans wiping out creatures like the giant shark known as the Megalodon.\u0026nbspHis research suggested that particles from these exploding stars could have caused cancers in large marine mammals to spike.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So disappointing when you pay soo much for a once in a lifetime opportunity.”Another commented: “@spicegirls how disappointing to spend money on a ticket to see you @principalitysta and the support act stole the show!

Kind of (barely), because it’s a lyrical tribute to “straight-talking London town”, which suited the group just fine. The vivacity of these five young women is arguably only more forceful on “Wannabe”. “Spice Up Your Life” was clumsy in its approach as “a song for the world”, with Latin influences and a Bollywood-inspired video, but the energy of the song is what makes it – the result of the five members recording the track in one chaotic afternoon.Despite the rather bizarre safe-sex disclaimer (“Be a little wiser, baby Put it on, put it on”), “2 Become 1” boasts a beautifully textured arrangement and unpolished vocals that capture the group’s unique character. On Spiceworld, “Viva Forever” was a surprisingly moving ballad that reflected on a past love.

It was their second number one single in the UK – released just as the popularity of “Wannabe” was beginning to wane – and also a top five song in the US.The Spice Girls cribbed a number of musical influences for their catalogue, but Motown is one that really shouldn’t have worked. “Stop”, however, is an uplifting song telling a significant other to slow down and just enjoy the ride, bolstered by a fantastic brass section and a jubilant bass line. A war cry that heralded the dawn of the Girl Power movement, and one of the most enduring pop songs of all time. “Wannabe” is the catchiest of all the Spice Girls songs, and through those defiant, half-laughing spoken word moments you understand why so many fans were desperate to be part of the gang.

They appear to be able to execute manoeuvre\u0026nbspthat human pilots would never be expected to pull off: rotating in the air, and accelerating and stopping at possibly fatal speeds.The latest reports are just the latest in a series of mysterious and unexplained reports of UFOs by US pilots. They have become so prevalent – and so little appears to be understood about where they have come from – that the US Navy has changed its reporting procedures in an attempt to learn more about where they are coming from.The pilots involved have said they will not speculate on the origin of the aircraft. We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths, one told the New York Times, which interviewed five pilots about their previously undiscussed experience.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Apple has announced the new iPod Touch, the first new iPod in four years.

Experts say that any alien explanation is unlikely, though they have not yet been able to rule it out, but it is more likely that it is the result of more mundane effects like bugs in the tracking systems and cognitive overload from such intense flights.US Navy unveils major response to UFO sightingsThe new reports come from pilots who had been flying through 2014 and 2015 over the East Coast of the US.Pilots first became aware of the craft when it showed up on radar tracking systems, they said, and initially thought it was the result of a secret drone programme. But they became more mysterious when they started seeing them in real life.One pilot said that he had almost crashed into one of the objects, which was described as looking like a sphere encasing a cube. Because the pilots were in danger of hitting the objects, they complained that if the craft were part of a secret programme it could be putting their lives at risk.In one of the sightings, which was captured on video, a pilot said he had nearly crashed into an object that was flying at a shocking speed. In the footage, pilots express wonder at the objects\u0027 flight, exclaiming:\u0026nbsp“Wow, what is that? and Look at it fly!”One of the pilots said that the planes appeared able to stay in the sky far longer than any known aircraft would normally be able to.“These things would be out there all day,”\u0026nbspRyan Graves, a pilot who has flown with the Navy for more than 10 years and reported his sightings to the US government,\u0026nbsptold the NYT. “Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a significant amount of energy. With the speeds we observed, 12 hours in the air is 11 hours longer than we’d expect.”And they were flying in ways that could kill a human crew, seeming to accelerate, stop and turn almost instantly.The pilots, who all refused to comment on what the craft could be, said the reports stopped after they moved out of US airspace.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I have nothing to add to my words, because I have no new information. Nothing promising, I should say. Our role today is to wait for some new solutions. I want to be as delicate as possible. I’m not in the mood to find a new formulation or a new appeal to my British colleagues.”Polls across the EU show support for leaving the bloc down to record low levels in most member states since Brexit. Predictions that Eurosceptics and populists would take a third of seats in the European parliament in last week’s elections also ended up being far off the mark.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And Mr Raab has said that there is still time to change the controversial backstop arrangements for the Irish border and negotiate a legally binding route for the UK to leave unilaterally.\u0026nbspMeanwhile, foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt said he was ready to form a new negotiation team taking in figures like the DUP’s Arlene Foster and European Research Group chair Jacob Rees-Mogg to persuade Brussels that an amended deal could get through parliament.But an exasperated Mr Juncker\u0026nbspgave short shrift to such plans, telling reporters at a Brussels summit: “I was crystal clear. There will be no renegotiation.”The agreement between the EU and Ms May to delay Brexit until Halloween included a commitment not to seek a renegotiation of the deal. And there is no appetite for further talks from a team of EU officials whose term in office comes to an end in November, when chief negotiator Michel Barnier is slated as a potential replacement for Mr Juncker as commission president.Meanwhile, Mr Bercow said that any suggestion a no-deal Brexit could be engineered by simply running down the clock to the end of October was “for the birds”.Liberal Democrats have warned that a no-deal Brexiteer in Downing Street could even suspend Commons sittings for the vital period this autumn to prevent MPs from finding a way to stop the UK crashing out.And the Institute for Government has warned that, with the death of Ms May’s Withdrawal Agreement Bill – which Downing Street has now accepted will not be tabled in parliament – MPs may have no procedural path to stand in the way of no deal.But the speaker told a US think tank:\u0026nbsp“The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit\u0026nbspis unimaginable.”He agreed leaving without a deal was the default position, but added: “There is a difference between a legal default position and what the interplay of different political forces in parliament will facilitate.”As the crowded field of would-be leaders swelled to 10 with the announcement by housing minister Kit Malthouse that he will run, Ms May warned her eventual successor not to leave the EU without a deal.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

It would be absolutely catastrophic for us as a party.”But rival candidate Esther McVey, who favours no deal, retorted: “Political suicide actually lies in not having a clean break from the EU and not leaving on 31 October.”The BBC announced it will host a live TV hustings in the middle of June, inviting all contenders still in the race to take part. Mr Raab and health secretary Matt Hancock have already challenged their rivals to a televised debate, amid speculation that Mr Johnson may shy away from the showdown.Mr Hancock said: “I’m delighted that broadcasters have agreed to hold TV debates – this is a contest that affects the whole country, so we should engage the whole country in this process.”The chair of the National Conservative Convention, Andrew Sharpe, has invited all candidates to a hustings on 15 June, when the group had been planning an emergency meeting to hold a vote of no-confidence in Ms May.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We now request the EHRC to look at all the evidence and investigate this matter with great urgency.”The complaint includes allegations of Islamophobia among MPs, an “atmosphere of hostility” against Muslim Conservatives, failed complaints processes and an overall denial that Islamophobia is a major issue for the party.Miqdaad Versi, of the MCB,\u0026nbspquestioned whether any of the contenders in the Tory leadership race would “prioritise dealing with the sheer scale of Islamophobia that has consumed the Conservative Party”.Tory Party faces 110 allegations of Islamophobia and racismWatchdog gives Tories one month to respond to Islamophobia complaintsGovernment rejects proposed definition of IslamophobiaMr Johnson was criticised over remarks comparing veiled Muslim women to letter boxes and bank robbers, but he was cleared of breaching the Conservative Party’s code of conduct.An independent panel found that the former foreign secretary was “respectful and tolerant” in his newspaper column.The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC), requested more information from the Conservatives on Islamophobia\u0026nbspearlier this month.The watchdog, which enforces equality laws, has the power to take action in court.“We have received complaints regarding the Conservative Party and are considering them in line with our usual processes,” an EHRC spokesperson said.“As part of our standard process, we have written to the Conservative Party to ask for information in order to help assess the complaints.”Afzal Khan raises Islamophobia complaints within Tory party and asks when it will adopt the internationally recognised definition of anti-Muslim hateThe call for an Islamophobia probe came as the EHRC announced a formal investigation over antisemitism in Labour on Tuesday.\u0026nbspIt will determine whether the party “has unlawfully discriminated against, harassed or victimised people because they are Jewish”.The MCB said the timing of its complaint was coincidental and pointed out that it alerted media outlets, including\u0026nbspThe Independent, before the EHRC’s announcement on Labour.Conservatives risk repeating Labour’s mistakes on antisemitismThe government was accused of disregarding the “safety and security of British Muslims” after rejecting a definition of Islamophobia put forward following a parliamentary inquiry.\u0026nbspCommunities secretary James Brokenshire pledged to “arrive swiftly at a collective position” earlier this month, after senior police officers raised concern about the potential impact on counterterror powers.Labour MP Wes Streeting, co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims, said the government had\u0026nbsp“no more credibility to define Islamophobia than the Labour Party had to redefine antisemitism”.“I have watched, with some amazement and even greater despair, the Conservative Party making exactly the same mistakes over Islamophobia as my party has with antisemitism,” he told the House of Commons.The decision came days before research found that more than 100 people claiming to be Conservative Party members had posted Islamophobic or racist comments online.The MCB has repeatedly called for an independent inquiry into prejudice and the handling of complaints within the party.MPs named in the complaint\u0026nbsp(Getty)Dozens of members have been suspended for posting Islamophobic comments on social media, including many directed at leadership contender Sajid Javid.The Conservatives were condemned after reinstating some councillors who had been suspended over racist or prejudiced social media posts.​The government’s commitment to combating anti-Muslim hatred was questioned in the wake of the Christchurch terror attacks, when mosques revealed they had been refused security funding.\u0026nbspWhile the government doubled the pot open for bids from different places of worship, it did not bring the funding up to the £14m awarded specifically to Jewish institutions.Muslim worshippers outside a mosque were targeted in the Finsbury Park terror attack and a man who planned to bomb another mosque in south London was jailed in April.Other incidents have seen women wearing headscarves run over in “revenge” for Islamist atrocities, and a man plough a car into an Indian restaurant because he wanted to “kill a Muslim”.Since the Westminster attack in March 2017, 14 Islamist and five far-right terror plots have been foiled in the UK.\u0026nbspLast week, the Home Affairs Committee was told that more than half of rising hate crime offences recorded by police in England and Wales are committed against Muslims.Muslim Council of Britain\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspEquality and Human Rights Commission\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’ve always argued that it’s perfectly possible that Leave would win again, but we’re supporting a people’s vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.”Pressure on the Labour leadership ratcheted up several notches after\u0026nbspthe party lost supporters to the Liberal Democrats and Green Party in the EU elections, leaving Labour with just 14 per cent of the vote.Hours after the results were announced, Ms Abbott tweeted: “We have to take the time to analyse the EU vote. But, when we come in third after the Brexit Party, that is a clue something is wrong with our strategy. We need to listen to our members and take a clearer line on a public vote.”Created with Sketch.

She said that\u0026nbspsecuring a general election remained the party’s priority but added: “As the clock\u0026nbsptickets down, if we’re not going to have a general election, we would support a people’s vote.”Jeremy Corbyn has promised a consultation on Labour’s Brexit\u0026nbsppolicy that could end at the party’s annual conference in September, but his close ally Ms Abbott\u0026nbspinsisted he needed to “move quickly”. She said she would personally back Remain in any second referendum.Former prime minister Tony\u0026nbspBlair\u0026nbspsaid he had voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” as he pushed for the party to throw its weight behind a referendum.He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling\u0026nbspSky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides.“What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.”As Labour isions on Brexit resurfaced in the aftermath of the elections, MPs\u0026nbspin Leave-supporting areas warned against another referendum.Wigan MP Lisa Nandy said it would most likely result in a no-deal outcome.Labour leadership backs ‘public vote’ on BrexitConservatives and Labour hit hard in EU election routLabour should promise referendum after ‘kicking’ say Corbyn alliesLabour must back second referendum or face election loss, Watson warnsShe said: “Obviously in constituencies like Wigan you get very mixed views, you get different views like everywhere in the country, but to most people the idea of a second referendum just seems quite absurd.“People were asked what they think, you can see from the results that we had here, that very few people have changed their minds and if there is a shift in this area of the country I think it’s towards no-deal Brexit.”Ms Nandy added: “I think we’ve got to wake up to the seriousness, not just of what we’re about to do to the Labour Party, but what we’re about to do the country because I strongly suspect that if there is a second referendum people here would come out and vote in fairly large numbers and probably vote for no deal.”She went on: “There is a huge frustration amongst Labour voters who voted Leave, in towns like mine, to see leading figures from the Labour Party out calling for a second referendum before there’s been any serious attempt to implement the result of the first.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with Britain off the menu at Tuesday’s meeting – which was\u0026nbspstrictly about choosing Jean-Claude Juncker’s successor – the prime minister was, for once, fed.Some wondered why she bothered to come, given her lame-duck status and the fact Britain is supposed to be leaving the EU. But she didn’t appear to care – arriving with the unusually cheerful demeanour of someone who’s had a ton of Brexit bricks lifted from her shoulders.She told reporters\u0026nbspthat she was in town because while Britain was still an EU member, it had all the same rights and obligations of any other country in the union – including choosing its next commission president. Perhaps worrying that this was a bit forthright, she quickly added that Britain, of course, would abide by the rules of “sincere cooperation” – Eurocrat speak for not taking the piss.\u0026nbspIn the room, the body language between May and her counterparts seemed genuinely warmer than usual. She took an overfamiliar embrace from Mr Juncker in her stride, meeting his gaze. Earlier in the week he’d told the world’s media through a spokesperson that she was a “courageous” leader. It was not long ago that in the same room that the prime minister was confronting him for supposedly calling her “nebulous”. For once, it looked like she was having a nice time.This won’t be the prime minister’s final visit to the EU capital – she’s due to come again in June for another scheduled meeting, where her fellow leaders will probably bid her a more formal farewell. It’s unlikely she’ll miss the city – which she claimed she had visited “something like 50” times – it is, after all, the site of some of her greatest political humiliations.\u0026nbspTory leadership candidates told there will be no Brexit renegotiationWhile the leaders tucked into their melon and dried figs (for that was the starter), the absence of Brexit did not go uncommented upon on the conference floor. Some European journalists, only half joking, openly celebrated the fact that the usual caravan of hacks from Westminster who follow the prime minister’s every move had mostly decided it wasn’t worth it this time.“The Brits actually stole the spot usually used by Belgian journos,” one Brussels local complained. Another quipped that they had been “spared the horde” of Brits that had been “invading” the last few meetings and taking up valuable desk space.It’s probably too early for them to celebrate. Brexit will be back here with a vengeance in October. And possibly for a long time after that, too.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Instead, it charged a yearly fee of 99 cents in order to generate revenue and cover the costs of hosting the chats of millions of users.WhatsApp experienced huge growth following the Facebook takeover\u0026nbspand now boasts more than 1.5 billion users from around 180 countries, however it has since softened its stance on adverts.WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton\u0026nbsphave both left the messaging app in recent years and have been critical of Facebook\u0027s attempts to monetise the app.In 2012, two years before the Facebook takeover, Mr Koum explained WhatsApp\u0027s stance towards advertising by quoting the movie\u0026nbspFight Club.Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can by shit we don\u0027t need, he wrote in a blog post.

The reversal was the result of intense pressure from New York citizens and lawmakers, including Representative Alexandia Ocasio-Cortez. Zephyr Teachout, who ran unsuccessfully for Attorney General alongside Cynthia Nixon’s failed mayoral attempt and AOC’s historic election in 2018, was also a major voice in the organising efforts.The grassroots campaign against Amazon’s subsidised move to New York cited the company’s labour practices, environmental impact, and contributions to America’s expanding wealth gap as reason for their opposition. Now, the New York Post reports\u0026nbspthat Amazon is coming to New York after all - all on their own.Jeff Bezos wants to help Trump return the US to the moonThe Post’s source claims they’re also considering space in the US Post Office building across the street, known as the James A Farley building.To some,\u0026nbspthe proposed move to Manhattan represents another round of success for the movement that pushed\u0026nbspback against tax breaks for the giant enterprise, proving that the need for state and city-funded assistance was unfounded.

One person was killed and dozens were injured.The storms were among 53 twisters that forecasters said touched down on Monday across eight states stretching eastward from Idaho and Colorado.Jeffrey Hazel, the mayor of Celina, near Dayton, said 81-year-old\u0026nbspMelvin Delhanna died during the tornado “as a direct result of a vehicle entering his house”.In Mercer County, where Celina is located, emergency management director Mike Robbins said that 12 people were injured in the storm.\u0026nbspMr Hazel said three of those injuries are considered to be serious but none are life-threatening.The National Weather Service (NWS)\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspsaid on Tuesday morning that roughly five million people throughout the state had been affected by the power outages.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Storm Prediction Center showed that 14 suspected tornadoes touched down in Indiana, 11 in Colorado and nine in Ohio.Dayton, the fifth-largest city in Ohio with 140,000 residents, was particularly affected. Nearly 60,000 residents were without power after the storm.

Utilities are expecting restoration to take several days.National Weather Service issues highest tornado warnings in two yearsFor now, Dayton city officials have asked residents to conserve water, as power was lost in the city’s water plants and pump stations.Montgomery County, where Dayton is\u0026nbsplocated, Miami County, and Greene County were the most affected by the tornadoes, which authorities described as large and dangerous.\u0026nbspThe National Guard has been deployed in the aftermath.Tornadoes also touched down in nearby Trotwood, where the mayor told residents that power lines and trees were down. Ohio’s tornado spree marks the latest in a particularly harsh year for tornadoes in the US, which have caused major damage and several deaths in Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, and several other states.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.In Indonesia hunters use dogs to track down dens, then shoot, electrocute or smoke the parents out. The same is thought to happen in Thailand. In Japan some traders have set up captive breeding centres nextdoor to cafes, but most animals are still imported – changing hands for large sums of money.Not only is the trade cruel because the stolen otters are given unsuitable homes, diets and surroundings, but worse – it is driving down populations of the species, according to the investigators.All four species native to Southeast Asia – the Asian small-clawed, the smooth-coated, the hairy-nosed and the Eurasian otter, are already in decline from habitat loss and climate change, but now the “exotic” pet trade poses a new threat, the report says. The hairy-nosed species has plummeted by half in three decades.\u0026nbspGekoski)In Japan, where more than a dozen animal cafes have otters, investigators found otters whimpering, shrieking and making distress calls while customers played with them. \u0026nbspSome animals were kept with no natural light or even without water. Others bit their claws and showed other signs of trauma, the witnesses reported.With more dealers cashing in, online activity has grown. The largest Indonesian Facebook group for buying and selling otters has 43,000 members. Other Indonesian groups have up to 16,000 members and all are very active, the charity said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGekoski)“Despite it being illegal to hunt, trade or breed them in Thailand, the country seems to have an abundance of new-born otters quickly and readily available for sale,” according to the report.Across the region rescue groups are struggling to keep up with the numbers of abandoned otters, which often arrive malnourished and underweight.Just because a wild animal is cute does not mean you should take it home\u0026nbspCassandra Koenen, of the charity, says: “Just because a wild animal is cute, it does not mean you should take it home with you. Unfortunately, this fact appears to be lost on many people as they are influenced by social media, and influencers showing them off as fun and cool pets. \u0026nbsp“Once otters are in people’s homes, there is no realistic way to replicate the space and freedom these animals would have in the wild. Many animals are kept in spaces vastly smaller than their natural habitats and they don’t have the correct nutrition, even if owners have their best intentions to feed them properly.”  \u0026nbspInvestigators were also told police and government officials help the trade. “One report from Indonesia stated a government worker requested operations on otters to remove the gland that causes them to smell, to make them more appealing as pets,” according to the document.\u0026nbspWAP is calling on social media users not to “like” posts featuring captive otters and wants the two non-protected species to be given the highest level of protection at the next Cites meeting.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So please don\u0027t ask me about names.” He said that “No one is interested in inter-institutional conflict” between the Council and Parliament.Earlier in the day the parliament’s president Antionio Tajani, also from Mr Weber’s centre-right EPP group, said the “majority” of groups in the parliament supported the spitzenkandidat system.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.French President Emmanuel Macron arrives at a European Union leaders summit, to discuss who should run the EU executive for the next five years, in Belgium.President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend a State Banquet with Japanese Emperor Naruhito, second from right, and Empress Masako at the Imperial Palace in TokyoFormer Italian PM and leader of the right-wing party Forza Italia Silvio Berlusconi looks at photographers as he casts his vote at a polling station in MilanA paramilitary soldier stands guard in front of closed shops during restrictions in downtown area of SrinagarPope Francis gestures as he participates alongside thousands of soccer-mad children in a project to promote the values of sport and soccer, at the VaticanBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) supporters celebrate their party\u0027s potential win as votes are counted for the Lok Sabha election in Bangalore, India.

It would carry around 700MW at high-voltage direct current, and run under the sea.Energy regulators in the two countries approved the project at the beginning of May this year, and it has now received the political go-ahead.Ireland votes overwhelmingly to liberalise orce lawsDeal or no deal?

This is just the beginning.In a warning to the Westminster parties, he said: If we dont leave on October  then the scores you have seen for the Brexit Party today will be repeated in a general election, and we are getting ready for it.Mr Farage repeated his demand for the Brexit Party to be involved in the negotiations ahead of the Halloween deadline.All EU citizens, as long as they are registered to vote, have the right to vote in the European elections.The UK uses the D’Hondt system of proportional representation which means the number of MEPs a party wins is directly related to the percentage of votes it receives.Voters choose a single party instead of an inidual candidate.This means all political parties have the chance to send representatives to the European Parliament.The proportion of seats given by a party directly reflects the proportion of votes won.In the first round of counting, the party with the most votes is allocated a seat for the candidate at the top of its list.Under the D’Hondt method, each party’s total number of votes is repeatedly ided – until all seats are filled – by isor  + the number of seats already allocated.If it is still top it gains another seat. If not, whichever party has the most votes then gets the seat instead.The original vote count of the largest party in each round is ided by one plus the total number of seats they have already been allocated, until all the seats for the region have been handed out.Although the method is considered to be one of the most constant and representative forms of voting, the results do not exactly reflect the votes, as this would lead to parties winning fractions of seats.EU voters go to the polls every five years to elect Members of the European Parliament .Each country has a specic number of seats based on their population size.The smallest is Malta and they have six seats, whereas the largest is Germany with .There are  MEPs in total and the UK has .Candidates can stand independently or with a party.They will represent a region of their country, and the number of MEPs for each region depends on population.The government confirmed the country would be taking part in the EU elections in early May after May administration was forced to push back the date it was leaving the bloc because MPs could not get a majority for her withdrawal agreement.As the UK was still in the EU at the time of the elections it is forced to take part even though the majority of voters said they wanted to leave in the referendum vote.The UK went to the polls to elect MEPs on May , .The vote is said to have cost around £million to hold.If a Brexit deal is agreed before the election date or soon after then the UK’s MEPS will not take their seats.Butthat doesn’t happen then the newly elected MEPs will take their place in the European Parliament – which sits in Brussels and Strasbourg - in early July.European Council President Donald Tusk has said that MEPs could sit for “months or even longer”the negotiations drag on.At this stage, how long the UK MEPs will continue to sit is anyones guess.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But Labour didn’t administer that kicking — instead they lost votes everywhere from Britain’s industrial heartlands to North London’s organic groceries.The message is clear: A plague on all your houses. And the lessons the parties should learn are equally obvious.For the Tories, it is that they have no God-given right to power. And their failure to deliver Brexit could be their death knell unless they get on the right track, sharpish.The leadership battle is already doing them serious damage as it turns all too quickly into a circular firing squad.We’ve got nothing against bright youngsters like Rory Stewart taking a punt at the premiership, but having a pop at colleagues on day one won’t help rebuild the party’s battered reputation.But that’s nothing compared to the current Chancellor threatening to bring down the Governmenta new leader pushes for a clean-break Brexit, evenhis party’s MPs and members vote for exactly that.If Hammond hasn’t clocked that failing to deliver the referendum result isn’t endearing the party to voters, these European results are a blunt reminder.Everybody who fancies the top job needs to explain, in detail, their Brexit plan. Andthey win, the party MUST deliver it. No s, no buts.Winning back Brexit Party voters is vital, but so is moving on from the referendum and pushing forward with a revitalised domestic programme.As for Labour  All that game-playing in Westminster hasn’t done them much good.But they still haven’t learnt.Emily Thornberry’s reaction to the Brexit Party’s streaking triumph around the country was to come out in favour of a second referendum.Working people have abandoned this prehistoric party and their dinosaur leader in droves.The European elections should never have happened. We should be out of the EU by now.For the Government, time could not be more pressing. A new leader can restore some faith in our politics, and take on Corbyn’s Marxists.The Tories need a quick contest, and a leader with a proper mandate. Anything  risks annihilation. But that doesn’t mean you can just abandon personal responsibility and demand taxpayers will bail you out.On that point, Paul Mason has pushed our sympathy to breaking point.And we worry the sense of entitlement that he displays when he opens his mouth is becoming st century Britain’s disease. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s time for a new generation to lead the charge into our future with boldness and vision.We must strengthen our Union, and the people we serve need a new social contract. A good job, a secure home and a brilliant school are the nuts and bolts of a happy le.As Housing Minister, it’s been my mission to build more high-quality homes as fast as we can, and numbers are looking good but there is much more work to do. We must pledge to offer these essentials to everyone: Job, House, School.I’ve run my own company for more than two decades, and weathered some really tough times, so I understand the opportunities and challenges small businesses face.We must revolutionise our economy, freeing a new generation of entrepreneurs to take risks and build businesses, creating jobs and wealth.And crucially we must spread that wealth with radical policies that make it easier for employees to own a stake in the business they work for, and to own shares generally. Everyone should have a piece of the national balance sheet.The Conservative Party must become the party of children, with their welfare, protection and future at the heart of everything we do.All of us have only one chance at childhood. It’s the foundation of our hopes, aspirations and character. There must be an all-out assault on child poverty, and we need to make the lives of parents easier.I’ve had political responsibility for a challenging social services department and London’s police force.Four years focused on a terrying surge in youth violence – and getting it under control – confirmed my view that education is the only social policy that consistently works.It is an escape route from a dead end, and the bedrock of social mobility. It’s also the reason I, and millions like me, got where we are.As Prime Minister I would make ours the party of well-funded schools, investing in the future of each and every child.That means investing heavily in science to tackle climate change and disease.As the chair of London Hydrogen, I promoted the green, British hydrogen fuel cell, and I founded the le sciences hub MedCity. I’ve led the debate on science in Parliament, and green tech would be central to my mission.We won’t get the chance to take on these and other pressing challenges unless we first work together to get Brexit completed.These steps - unity, a viable Brexit plan and a compelling domestic agenda - will secure a bright future for our remarkable country.I got into politics to get things done. As Deputy Mayor for Policing in the capital I drove action to cut teen killings by % and devised our first ever violence against women and girls strategy.I would bring this experience of fighting crime to being Prime Minister. As a councillor I led the effort that halved rough sleepers in central London, and now I’m building houses for the young.I’m a Northern boy who built a business in the Midlands and now represents a stunning part of Hampshire.My granddad was a Yorkshire wagon driver, my grandma a teacher, and my Mum and Dad were the first in their families to go to university.My family’s story is one of education, hard work and opportunity, and that’s what I want for everyone.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On Sunday it took several minutes to establish whether or not one of them, Wheeler Dealer, could impersonate an animal.When it does get going the show can very occasionally feel like arriving two hours late at the pub. Everyone’s laughing but you’ve no idea why.For the most part, though, The Ranganation belongs to the same comedy applause school as The Last Leg, Mash Report and New World Order.They’ll clap anything here, in fact. Romesh’s mum admits taking a curry to the cinema . Nigel Farage gets covered in milkshake . The Dogfather telling us to: “Stop raping the planet,” .Although, I say anything, the moment it broke down was when half a dozen people applauded the idea of Boris Johnson becoming Prime Minister and, woah!, Romesh had to threaten them, jokingly, with ejection.They’d broken the rules, you see. Shows like The Ranganation like to think of themselves as edgy, but they’re very tightly governed by the laws of political correctness.This means you no longer have to be funny to be a stand-up or comedy host, but you must be on-message, which is why, paradoxically, we’ve never had more comedians on telly but so few actual laughs.Flogging them to death doesn’t work either. You may have found Katherine Ryan and Romesh funny the first time you saw them, but you’re probably fed up with the sight of them by their thousandth appearance.As for the actual process of this show The Ranganation wasn’t sure dating apps worked and milkshake throwing was also a grey area, but the host definitely thought we could save the planet by not flushing our toilets.“So do you mindI come round your house and p*** like a horse ”It’d be appreciated, ta.Good Morning Britain, Piers Morgan: “I am not morbidly obese.”Good Morning Britain, Kevin Maguire: “There are quite a few Leave voters at the BBC.”And Good Morning Britain, Susanna Reid: “Honestly,Andi Peters was in  Hunks, which he should be, he’d be scoring .” Out of what, Susanna OVER on BBC’s look-into-the-future drama Years And Years, all-out nuclear war between China and America seems to have fizzled out after one episode.The good news, though, is it seems to have released enough radiation poisoning to kill off Jessica Hynes’s character, Edith, the campaigner, activist and all-round pain-in-the-ar*e, within the next couple of episodes.If you think that’ll be the end of the political lecture, however, you couldn’t be more wrong.Writer Russell T Davies is far too hot under the collar about America, Israel, “the West”, bankers, privatisation and “NHS cuts” to get off his high horse any time soon.Weirdly, he also wants Years And Years viewers to try and believe that, in the not-too-distant future, a Christian regime, in the Ukraine, will be torturing gay people.Which, given that homosexuality is currently and exclusively a death penalty offence in ten Islamic states, has to be one of the most cowardly distortions of reality I’ve ever seen on a television drama.Far less sinister, but almost as tiresome, is the continued presence of Alexander Armstrong on Years And Years.He turned up hosting a  edition of Have I Got News For You in the first episode, and then reappeared fronting Pointless Celebrities, in the year , last week.So don’t expect any sympathyhe reappears tonight on Best Ever Christmas , still murdering Fields Of bloody Gold.You’ve been given your four-minute warning.Michael Owen: “It was great opportunityism from the striker.”And Neil Lennon: “It’s a once-in-a-letime opportunity that’s come round again.”Victoria Coren Mitchell’s nauseating love-in with MP Jess Phillips on Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan telling Le Stories guest Mel B The Spice Girls were “the female Beatles”, when they weren’t even the female Tremeloes.Hollyoaks actor Maxim Baldry attempting a Ukrainian accent in Years And Years.Every bone-idle chancer in Britain interpreting “Bank Holiday Monday” as “Take Friday off as well”.And Britain’s Got Talent auditions getting lost in sob stories, sentimentality and all those magical charisma voids who begin by announcing: “I need someone to come up and help me.” BZZZZZ, “Next ”B “Form a conga with Seumas Milne and start celebrating.”C “We don’t know.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In  Serbian Branislav Ivanovic joined which London-based football team ”I’d have had these people housed in the sort of lodges we give away on this programme.”But you weren’t, so stop playing the hero and just link to your rip-off phone-line competition. Picture research by Alfie Snelling.NEVER a good sign, is it, when you vomit up your own decomposed internal organs, have to be buried in a zinc coffin and a cement mixer turns up to your funeral That’s the thing about Sky Atlantic’s Chernobyl, though, it spares you no details about the greatest technological catastrophe of the th century. Nor should it.Because, shamefully, I hadn’t realised just how close the  disaster came to destroying the entire planet.As well as flagging up my own appalling ignorance, this must also be some sort of tribute to the power of a production where they’ve got everything right, from the Soviet-era clothingto the script and performances of all the main leads, Jared Harris, Jessie Buckley, Emily Watson and even the bloke in the Mikhail Gorbachev skull cap.It loses absolutely nothing, either, from the fact that Finchy from The Office appears to have been in the Politburo, and that the heroic leader of the Russian miners, who tunnelled underneath the damaged reactor, was Trevor off EastEnders.Well, OK, maybe it takes a bit of the edge off, but still, Chernobyl is not just the best thing on TV, it’s the only thing right now.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Tory MEPs were almost wiped out.It was expected, but that cannot hide the seriousness of the Conservatives’ crisis. Not only did most voters abandon them — even the majority of their own members voted for the Brexit Party.Many others, including me, refused to take part in a ballot that should never have taken place, for an organisation that we should not be part of.No party can last for long with its vote in freefall and its activists staying home or supporting a rival.The Tories must find a way to regain trust, inspire their troops and win back millions of lost voters.That means being completely honest and clear about why this happened. It is human nature to look for comforting excuses to explain away shocking news. But that would be no use.This crisis is entirely self-inflicted. The Conservatives gave the people a referendum and promised, before, during and after, to do as voters decided.Theresa May pledged scores of times that we would leave the EU, deal or no deal, in March.She broke that promise and her Cabinet colleagues let her do it. As Daniel Hannan, one of the Party’s surviving MEPs, put it: “People voted to leave three years ago and we haven’t left, it’s as simple as that.”Many voters were already deeply unhappy about the way the PM kept watering down and abandoning her negotiating red lines. Ditching the Brexit deadline was the last straw and pushed them over the edge. Step one of recovery is clear: Brexit must happen.If there’s a glimmer of hope it’s that May has agreed to resign. Imagineshe was still barricaded in Downing Street — more time would be wasted on the struggle to prise her out of the building.Instead, the race to succeed her has begun. No more politely pretending that “there’s no vacancy”. Instead, the MPs who hope to be the next Prime Minister can openly set out their stalls.There is no time to waste. This has got to be a proper contest, to produce a leader whose abilities and ideas have been thoroughly tested. The stakes are as high.Tory members, disillusioned, frustrated and bruised, want totheir party to winning ways. Democrats want the Leave vote to be honoured.And everyone wants to hear the proposals put forward by those who want to govern.The only option is to get this right and keep that essential promise. The future of the Conservative Party rests on it, but far more importantly so does the future of our country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That is so dangerous!’Looking around I saw an opened packet on the shelf that obviously a shopper had left there - did they not understand how incredibly dangerous these items are I decided that we needed to show what damage these batteries can do, so I put some chicken fillets in my trolley and my daughters and I did the time-lapse photos that afternoon.”To carry out the experiment, Sarah - a paediatric nurse - placed a battery inside a chicken fillet for a total of four hours and monitored the level of damage done during that period.The first image was taken after  minutes showing some noticeable black marks, while the third image was taken after four hours with clear burning to the chicken.It represents the similar damage that could be caused to your little ones stomachthey swallowed one.For more information and advice visit the Child Accident Prevention Trustwebsite.Sarah said: “Even though I have seen first hand the damage that a button battery can do, I was still shocked at the immediacy of the burns.According to The Battery Controlled campaign, when a coin-sized lithium button battery gets stuck in a child’s throat, the saliva triggers an electrical current.This then causes a chemical reaction that can severely burn the oesophagus in as little as two hours.If this has happened to your child, they will likely start coughing, drooling or complain about discomfort.Sarah hopes that her experiment will help parents visualise the dangers button batteries present.She said: “In my career as a paediatric emergency nurse I have cared for children who had swallowed or choked on button batteries.“A few were lucky because it was witnessed by a parent and they knew to seek immediate emergency help, however, most ended up with horric injuries, sometimes requiring years of ongoing treatmentthey survived.”She added that prevention is the best cure and urged parents to have a scout around the home to get rid of any button batteries that might be lurking around."},{"url":null,"title":"us navy pilots spot ufos","story":"The daily sightings came over the course of  and  and were reported to the Pentagon and Congress.Lieutenant Ryan Graves said he saw “strange objects” with “no visible engine or infared exhaust plumes” reaching at least , feet and flying at hypersonic speeds almost daily while training off the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.Graves, an F A- Super Hornet pilot who has been with the Navy for  years, told The New York Times: “These things would be out there all day.“Keeping an aircraft in the air requires a signicant amount of energy.“With the speeds we observed,  hours in the air is  hours longer than we’d expect.”The unidentied flying objects were seen performing manoeuvres that were “beyond the physical limits of a human crew,” like stopping rapidly, turning instantly or immediately accelerating at hypersonic speeds, the pilots said.The sightings were reported to the Pentagon’s shadowy Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Program, which confirmed earlier this month they still investigate claimed sightings of alien spacecraft.In late , a Super Hornet pilot said he almost hit one of the objects — which he said looked like a sphere encasing a cube — and an official mishap report was filed.Another pilot, Lt. Danny Accoin said he could identy a flying object on his radar, missile system and infared camera but couldn’t actually see it in his helmet camera.A minute-long video appears to show two encounters with the enigmatic phenomena where the pilots talk to each other about what they see on the radar screens.“Look at that thing. It’s rotating,” one of them said.“Wow, what is that, man ” another exclaims. “Look at it fly!”At first the pilots interviewed in the report thought the objects were part of a top-secret drone program.But after the near-collision they reason that government officials knew there were fighter pilots in the area and would not send drones to get in the way.Navy spokesman Joseph Gradisher said it’s unclear what caused the sightings detailed in the article.The Times report comes after the Navy in April sent out a new classied guidance for how to report the “unexplained aerial phenomena.”A number of reports ensued but some cases could have been commercial drones, Gradisher said.But, in other cases: “We don’t know who’s doing this, we don’t have enough data to track this. So the intent of the message to the fleet is to provide updated guidance on reporting procedures for suspected intrusions into our airspace.”Neither Graves nor the other pilots or the Department of Defence would speculate on what the objects were.“We’re here to do a job, with excellence, not make up myths,” one pilot said. The Department of Defence went as far to reveal they will continue to probe such reports in a bid to keep the nation safe.A spokesperson for the the Department of Defence was forced to admit that reports, claiming their investigations were stopped in , were not true.OFFICIAL STATEMENTSpeaking to the NY Post, Christopher Sherwood said in a statement: The Department of Defence is always concerned about maintaining positive identication of all aircraft in our operating environment, as well as identying any foreign capability that may be a threat to the homeland.“The department will continue to investigate, through normal procedures, reports of unidentied aircraft encountered by US military aviators in order to ensure defense of the homeland and protection against strategic surprise by our nation’s adversaries.”WHAT IS THE ADVANCED AEROSPACE THREAT IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM The investigations are part of the US governments, Advanced Aerospace Threat Identication Programme .The program began in  and was run by military intelligence official, Luis Elizondo.The existence of the AATIP was revealed in , along with a -second DOD video that shows an airborne object being chased by two Navy jets off the coast of San Diego in .Defence experts across the world have been left shell shocked by this bombshell revelation.Nick Pope who launched secret probes into UFOs for the UK during the s said this new admission makes it clear that they really did study what the public would call UFOs.UFOs have been repeatedly investigated by the American military, including a study code-named Project Blue Book which started in .A version of this story originally appeared on the NY Post."},{"url":null,"title":"alastair campbell expelled labour voting lib dems","story":"The Labour veteran has his membership revoked for publicly backing another party in the European elections.Mr Campbell blasted Labour for kicking him out - when activists accused of anti-Semitism have been allowed to stay in.The spin doctor was Mr Blairs press secretary in  Downing Street then became Labours press secretary and campaign director.He is known as one of the ex-PMs closest allies and is now a leading figure in the Peoples Vote campaign.Mr Campbell revealed on Sunday night that he voted Lib Dem in protest against Jeremy Corbyns flip-flopping on Brexit.He said today: Sad and disappointed to receive email expelling me from Labour particularly on a day leadership finally seems to be moving to the right place on Brexit, not least thanks to tactical voting by party members, including MPs, councillors and peers who back a second referendum.I am and always will be Labour.

The same pattern was repeated where.In Germany, a surge for the Greens brought the long dominant Christian Democrats their worst result in decades.In France, Marine Le Pen’s right-wing National Rally topped the poll, and the two traditional centrist parties – the Republicans and the Socialists – almost disappeared.Even more dramatic gains for the Eurosceptics could be found in Italy. The nationalist League was far in front, with  per cent of the vote, while the maverick, rebellious Five Star movement won  per cent, putting the Italian anti-EU forces in an absolute majority.Populists also triumphed in Hungary, where Viktor Orban Civic Alliance gained no less than  per cent of the vote, and in Poland, where the right-wing Law and Justice party was victorious with  per cent.Indeed, throughout Europe there were advances for anti-establishment politicians - whether it be the Greens in Ireland or the nationalists in Sweden.As triumphant Greens edge out centre-left and centre-right parties, the EU will become even more polarised and ided, which will make it harder for parliament to .All this change is driven by widespread outrage at the disaster that the EU has inflicted on the countries of Europe.Without any mandate, the unaccountable, power-mad cabal in Brussels has weakened the fabric of the continent.National democracy has been pulverised by the quest for EU unication.National identities have been undermined by mass immigration on an unprecedented scale, particularly after the German Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the floodgates in .National economic interests have been sacriced on the altar of the European single currency.The EU fanatics like to paint populism as a form of extremism but, on the contrary, it is the natural response to the removal of democratic rights and freedoms.Across Europe, people want their countries back. They have had enough of betrayal.They prefer to govern themselves rather than be ruled by unelected officials.They are tired of being labelled bigots simply for feeling a sense of patriotism, that noble ideal which is really an extension of love of family.The real extremists are those EU zealots who show contempt for the ideas of national pride and sovereignty.Yet, there is no sign that the Brussels regime, cocooned by its ideology, has woken up to the scale of the upheaval.Just the opposite is true.Since yesterday, the EU ruling elite and its cheerleaders have indulged in a gigantic propaganda exercise, pretending that the results are not that signicant, that the populist insurgency has been exaggerated, that the barbarians have been held at the gates.In this climate of delusion, it is asnothing has happened.An attitude of business as usual prevails, as shown by today’s Brussels summit, where European leaders discussed the preparations for choosing a new EU President and Commission, given that the term of Jean Claude Juncker will soon end.In the time-honoured fashion of the EU’s institutions, another establishment stitch-up is probably on the way.Beyond mouthing a few empty words about reform, Brussels bosses seem to have learned no lesson from the anti-establishment fury.That is because they are so obsessed with the grand European project of political unity.Since its foundation in the s, the entire purpose of European Community has been the creation of a federal superstate.Every policy, every treaty is focused on the mission of ever closer union towards the ultimate goal of a United States of Europe.Nothing is allowed to stand in the way of this crusade. Even democracy and nationhood must be sacriced for the sake of the integrationist dogma.At the entrance to the Visitors Centre in the European Parliament, there is a plaque with the words, “National sovereignty is the root cause of the most crying evils of our time”, for which the “final remedy is the federal union of the people.”That was written by the British diplomat Lord Lothian, a committed appeaser right up to . His spirit still permeates the corridors of power in Brussels.Federalism explains why the EU is so addicted to the abolition of borders through free movement, because the obliteration of national identities will promote the new concept of European citizenship.Similarly, the creation of the single currency in  was not primarily an economic initiative but a political vehicle to enforce integration by undermining national independence.Through its arrogance, the EU is sowing the seeds for its own destruction.Without change, Brussels will become ever more crisis-ridden, ever more in-debted, ever more unpopular.The betrayal of the public is unsustainable in the long-term. In fact, collapse could arrive swtly in the coming decade, either through another financial crisis or through another major country, like Italy or France, deciding to leave.If the Brussels bosses had any sense, they would abandon their ideological project and instead make the union just a trading bloc of free, independent nations.That is what Britain was meant to have joined in  when we signed up for the Common Market, only to find we were sucked into the federalist quagmire.The British people eventually woke up to this reality.We had the courage to vote for independence - and Brexit is the spark that has helped to fuel the flames of rebellion across the continent.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No Parliament can bind the hands of its successor. This Parliament can do as this Parliament thinks fit.It came as Theresa May reiterated her position that the best option remained leaving with a deal.Britain is on course to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal - unless the law is changed to extend further.There is currently no provision for MPs to amend the law to stop Britain leaving without a deal and leadership contenders such as Johnson and Raab have warned they may end up going for it.But Mr Bercow’s comments today signal he is willing to help create a way for MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.He said there was “no inevitability” about a No Deal Brexit and dismissed the suggestion that MPs had lost their chance to block No Deal once and for all.The only way to completely rule out a No Deal Brexit is for Britain to revoke Article .A request for a further extension could be blocked by just one EU member state - meaning Britain would leave without a deal on October .Speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC, the Speaker said: “There is a dference between a legal default position and what the interplay of dferent political forces in parliament will facilitate.”He added: “The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.”“The appetite for the house to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed some would say it’s voracious.“The house will want to have its say. The idea that the house will not have it say is for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.“The idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen blasted: “This is further evidence -ever we needed it - of his Remain-supporting bias throughout the Brexit process. He’s a self-proclaimed Remainer who has ripped out every rule of impartiality from the Speaker’s rulebook.“Whoever the new leader of the Conservative party is will have to fight not only a Remain-dominated Parliament but also a Remain-supporting Speaker.”He added: “One thing’s for certain - John Bercow, the impartial Speaker, always has his say - everyday in Parliament, it’s almost like Speaker’s Question Time with Points of Order.”Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “In respect of the Speaker, we are subject to European law until the day we leave and European law is very clear that we leave on a set date unless a request for an extension is made and the EU grants that extension. That’s it.So Parliament only gets its say in terms of legislation, it can’t take over the Government at any stage, it can’t run the legislative programme, so it’s European law that will get the final say.”The EU has been clear that while it is willing to discuss changes to the political declaration on the next part of the relationship they would not change the terms of the Withdrawal Agreement.Boris Johnson, who is the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, has declared hes prepared to crash out of the EU with no deal on October .Among the candidates prepared to leave with no deal are:Boris JohnsonHe is the favourite to replace Theresa May as Tory leader and Prime Minister.He said he would take the UK out of the European Union on the st October with a deal or without.Dominic RaabEsther McVeyAndrea LeadsomThose who have not ruled out a no deal Brexit include:Michael GoveSajid JavidJeremy HuntKit MalthouseMatt HancockJames CleverlyAgainst no deal Brexit:Rory StewartAs has former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, former Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom and Esther McVey.Another candidate, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, said it would be “political suicide” to pursue a no-deal Brexit, a reprimand to frontrunner Boris Johnson who said last week that Britain should leave with or without a deal by the end of October.Hunt, who voted to stay in the EU in the  referendum but now accepts Brexit, said he would try for a new agreement that would take Britain out of the EU customs union while “respecting legitimate concerns” around the Irish border."},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock dominic raab pledge prime minister","story":"Amid fears the battle to replace Theresa May could rip the party in two, the pair challenged their eight competitors to sign up to five pledges.The vows range from “not speaking ill of fellow Conservatives” to avoiding “personality attacks” and sticking “strictly to spending limits.Critics said it was yet another bid by ‘Team Raab’ to hobble clear favourite Boris Johnson – given his ‘connection’ with voters.The move came as Aid Secretary and rank outsider Rory Stewart hit back at claims he is nothing more than an “outrider” for Michael Gove’s own leadership campaign.Sources claimed he was acting as a “suicide bomber” and attacking Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab to make it easier for Mr Gove.Taking to Twitter, Mr Stewart said: “I’m running on principle and because I believe we can uny this country and make it a much better place.”Mr Raab – the ex-Brexit Secretary – last night said the campaign should be a battle of ideas, not personalities.And he said: “Whoever wins this election needs to bring the party back together so that we can take on and defeat Jeremy Corbyn.“Fighting a clean campaign is essentialwe want to unite our party again.”Matt Hancock said: “We shouldn’t hold back when it comes to debating ideas, but this contest should be about policies not personalities.“We’ll all need to work with reach others and come together as a party after this, so it’s especially important that we don’t engage in negative personal attacks and instead keep this contest focused on the issues.”Goodness knows it needs it. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Well, on Thursday, we secured . per cent.If we break that vote down by constituency, every single Tory MP loses.The first-past-the-post system is capricious. It protects you until, all of a sudden, it eliminates you.Just ask Scottish Labour.As long as our political debate revolves around Brexit, people are likely to vote for the most hardline pro and anti-Brexit parties.Indeed, the longer this wretched argument goes on, the more radicalised both sides become. Voters identy as Remain or Leave rather than according to their old party alignments.Three years ago, at the time of the referendum campaign, it was still a civil conversation rather than a civil war.The polarisation has come since the result, and it has become worse with every passing week.Most Leavers now want No Deal. Most Remainers want another referendum.The moment when both sides might have accepted a compromise — ideally a Swiss-type solution that would have taken us out of the EU’s political structures while retaining close economic links — has probably passed.So whose fault is it that we are in this situation  Hardliners on both sides must take their share of the blame.Those Remainers who promised to respect the result but then worked to frustrate it have done terrible damage to our politics.Those Leavers who, forgetting everything they said during the campaign, now insist that anything short of No Deal is a betrayal, have likewise destroyed trust in the system.But the chief responsibility lies with Theresa May.It was she who dug in on the wrong issues while conceding on the wrong issues, who mulishly insisted that it was all about immigration, who managed to convince both sides that she was secretly working for the other, who so aggravated EU leaders that, by the end, they were predisposed to reject anything she asked for because it was she who was doing the asking.Worst of all, she called and then lost the  election. From that moment, it was clear that our Parliament was prepared to frustrate Brexit.The EU got the message and started making deliberately absurd and vindictive demands, culminating in the Irish backstop which, incredibly, Theresa May accepted.We now face withdrawal terms so disadvantageous that they are worse than either staying or quitting — exactly as Michel Barnier intended.Which brings us back to the Catch-.Parliament does not intend to allow any government to leave the EU with No Deal, and the Commons Speaker has made clear that he is prepared to bend the rules in any way necessary to secure that end.In normal times, a Conservative leader would go to the country saying: “Give me the mandate I need. If Brussels knows we are ready for No Deal, we will get a good deal. We just need the numbers in Parliament.“Do you want me in charge, or a Marxist nostalgic who refuses to have a position on Brexit ”In normal times, such a leader would win comfortably. But these are not normal times.A large chunk of the electorate is now disposed to blame the Conservatives for the impasse rather than the parties that have actually been voting against Brexit.Nigel Farage has confirmed that he plans to contest every seat at the next election. The idea that he might stand aside in certain constituencies in order to stop Corbyn is based on a misunderstanding of how he operates.He is back at the head of a populist insurgent party.The last thing he wants is to have that party’s grievance addressed and so put himself out of business.Is there any solution  Possibly.It may be that Parliament cannot in fact block a No Deal Brexit. It may be that,forced to choose, MPs will baulk at voting to revoke Article .It may be that France, or another EU state, vetoes any extension beyond October  — though that is unlikely.Or it may be that the Tories could, in fact, win a general election.Perhaps I am wrong about Farage’s motivations, and he will agree to an electoral pact, fighting Labour in the North while standing aside in the South.Or maybe there’s another way out of the jam, one I can’t think of.But what cannot be denied is that the dilemma exists.There is no point in saying, “Just leave!” or “I’ll get us a better deal!” unless you are clear about how you intend to do it.The trouble is that, in the current mood, those are precisely the slogans that many Tory activists want to hear.The candidate who levels with them, who sets out the dilemma honestly and outlines a proposed route out of it, may become unelectable.

Secondly, I do feel that now is a time in which momentous events are taking place and there are great issues to be resolved and in those circumstances, it doesn’t seem to me sensible to vacate the chair.”Bercow yesterday told a US audience it was “unimaginable” MPs won’t be able to act despite a No Deal exit being the legal default and warned there are years of debate ahead” on Brexit.The arch-Remainers words fly in the face of Tory leadership front runners Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab, who have both guaranteed the UK will leave the EU by Halloween - with or without a deal.Mr Bercow also fuelled the peoples vote campaign by suggesting MPs had the right to force a second referendum or even revoke Article .He said: They can’t be wished away or snfed at, but these matters were matters decided by the last Parliament. No Parliament can bind the hands of its successor. This Parliament can do as this Parliament thinks fit.Bercow broke his pledge to stand down by June last year.When he stood to be Speaker in  he promised only to serve for nine years but he has justied staying on longer because of the uncertainty caused by Brexit.But European Commission President Jean Claude Junker delivered a stark message to candidates in the race to replace Theresa May.Speaking to television cameras outside a summit in Brussels he said: There will be no renegotiation.The Eurocrats stubborn stance is bad news for Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunts Tory leadership bid. Yesterday, he said his Brexit policy was to try for renegotiation.Britain is on course to leave the EU on October  with or without a deal - unless the law is changed to extend further.There is currently no provision for MPs to amend the law to stop Britain leaving without a deal and leadership contenders such as Boris Johnson and Dominic Raab have warned they may end up going for it.But Mr Bercow’s comments yesterday signal he is willing to help create a way for MPs to block a No Deal Brexit.He said there was “no inevitability” about a No Deal Brexit and dismissed the suggestion that MPs had lost their chance to block No Deal once and for all.The only way to completely rule out a No Deal Brexit is for Britain to revoke Article .A request for a further extension could be blocked by just one EU member state - meaning Britain would leave without a deal on October .Speaking at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC, the Speaker said: “There is a dference between a legal default position and what the interplay of dferent political forces in parliament will facilitate.”He added: “The idea that parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable.”“The appetite for the house to have its say has recently been whetted and that appetite is not exhausted. Indeed some would say it’s voracious.“The house will want to have its say. The idea that the house will not have it say is for the birds. Parliament is a big player in this.“The idea that Parliament is going to be evacuated from the centre stage of debate on Brexit is unimaginable. It is simply unimaginable.”Tory MP Andrew Bridgen blasted: “This is further evidence -ever we needed it - of his Remain-supporting bias throughout the Brexit process. He’s a self-proclaimed Remainer who has ripped out every rule of impartiality from the Speaker’s rulebook.“Whoever the new leader of the Conservative party is will have to fight not only a Remain-dominated Parliament but also a Remain-supporting Speaker.”He added: “One thing’s for certain - John Bercow, the impartial Speaker, always has his say - everyday in Parliament, it’s almost like Speaker’s Question Time with Points of Order.”Ex-leader Iain Duncan Smith said: “In respect of the Speaker, we are subject to European law until the day we leave and European law is very clear that we leave on a set date unless a request for an extension is made and the EU grants that extension. That’s it.So Parliament only gets its say in terms of legislation, it can’t take over the Government at any stage, it can’t run the legislative programme, so it’s European law that will get the final say.”"},{"url":null,"title":"jeremy corbyn back second referendum this week","story":"In a major Brexit betrayal, the Euro-sceptic leader could cave in to Remainers demands and back a so-called Peoples Vote - perhaps in the next few days.Labour sources told The Mirror the -year-old was expected to back a peoples vote as early as this week.Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford fuelled speculation there could be a breakthrough.He said: “He continues to get advice from a iety of dferent sources.

And senior figures said he could announce his backing within days. After the exodus of supporters to Remain parties the Lib Dems and Greens amid accusations he was sitting on the Brexit fence, the leader now looks poised to back a people’s vote within days. He has been under mounting pressure to get behind a ­referendum. And Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford, who spoke to Mr Corbyn on the phone this week, fuelled hopes of a breakthrough. He said: “He continues to get advice from a iety of dferent sources. I think the UK position is still evolving.

Labour won just .% of the vote and  seats at last week’s EU elections, compared with .% and  seats for the Lib Dems and .% and seven seats for the Greens. Both of those jubilant parties support a second referendum. The Tories got a miserly .% of the vote, winning just four seats.    ButMr Corbyn does back a people’s vote, he risks losing Labour Leavers to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which triumphed at the elections.

She said: “We’re supporting a People’s Vote strongly now because it’s the right thing to do and it’s the democratic thing to do.” Insisting the party was “foregrounding” a second referendum, she added: “There is no inherent contradiction between respecting the result of the referendum and having a People’s Vote, not least because it’s still not sure how a People’s Vote would pan out.” She went on: “Our position is that ideally we want a general election -we can’t get a general election in time, we would support a People’s Vote.”  Former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he voted Labour “without great enthusiasm” last week as he stepped up demands for the party to support another referendum. He said Mr Corbyn “has got to come to a clear position”, telling Sky News: “The one that is very obvious is that both party leaderships have made the same mistake, which is to think that it’s possible to sit on the fence on Europe and appeal to both sides. “What the European elections show you is that isn’t possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sajid javid pledges 20000 extra","story":"NewsSajid Javid pledges , extra police officershe wins Tory leadership raceConservative leadership hopeful said he would spend £ billion over three years to put \"police on the beat\" -he can see off the challenge of  othersShareCommentsByAndrew Gilpin:,  MAY NewsSajid Javid wants more police on the street \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSajid Javid has pledged to oversee , extra police officers pounding the pavementselected Prime Minister.

The Police Federation of England and Wales have previously raised concerns of underfunding and under resourcing policing. Speaking in April following the publication of police-recorded crime figures by the Office of National Statistics, vice-chairman Che Donald said: Crime across the board is going up, the only things that are not going up are police numbers, police pay and meaningful funding the Government should be investing in our police service so we can get on with tacking this highly concerning situation.

Candidates for Tory leader are lining up to back a hard exit in a pitch to the partyaposs , voting members. Some are fighting against crashing out of the EU without a deal - with Jeremy Hunt branding the plan suicide.But none are fighting to stop Brexit altogether, and none are fighting to hold a second referendum. Whoever wins the Tory leadership contest will be in  Downing Street by the end of July, and try to put their strategy in place over the summer.  That means they will have a massive impact on how we leave the EU on October , or whether we do at all.The EU could offer an extension beyond Halloween , or Parliamentary gridlock could force a general election.Britainaposs electoral system means we vote for MPs, not a PM - who whoeveraposs in power can steer Brexit without an election by you, the public. Instead the nationaposs policy looks set to be decided by the , Tories who vote in the leadership contest. So what are the candidatesapos positions on Brexit  And how likely are they to crash us out without a deal  Weaposve profiled their positions below - carefully finding comments theyaposve made since coming out for leadership.  Boris JohnsonHARD BREXIT RATING: .  The frontrunner declared heaposs prepared to crash out of the EU with no deal on October . We will leave the EU on October , deal or no deal, Mr Johnson said in May . To get things done you need to be prepared to walk away. But behind the scenes heaposs been less hardline, telling moderate MPs his preference is still a negotiated exit. One insider in his camp told the Mirror: He knows that no deal would be damaging. Butyou want to renegotiate youaposve got to keep it on the table. The problem for moderate Tory MPs, members and the public is this - which Boris Johnson should they believe  Leadership rival Rory Stewart compared him to liar Pinocchio, saying Borisapos no deal promise went back on pledges he made in private. And heaposs famously chosen his views opportunistically, coming out for Leave in  at the moment of maximum impact despite writing an article for each side. He did however burnish his Brexiteer credentials by quitting Cabinet in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal. Dominic RaabHARD BREXIT RATING: .  The former Brexit Secretary backs leaving without a deal on October  -thataposs what it takes. He has said Britain should be getting a fairer deal and he would prefer to leave with a renegotiated deal. But he added the UK must calmly demonstrate unflinching resolve to leave in October - at the latest. Critics fear his hardline views will make him more likely to walk out of negotiations with the EU. That would plunge the UK into no-deal in October, or could force a general electionMPs revolt against the government. Mr Raab walked out of the Cabinet in November in protest at Theresa Mayaposs deal and has said itaposs time for a new direction. Jeremy HuntHARD BREXIT RATING:  The Foreign Secretary has said pushing for No Deal Brexit would be political suicide and could make the Conservatives extinct. He added MPs could force a general election against any Prime Minister who tried - putting Jeremy Corbyn in Downing Street by Christmas.The comments, in May , are the latest stage in a long run flip-flopping opinions from Mr Hunt. He voted Remain in  but later tried to appeal to Tory Brexiteers, comparing the EU to the Soviet Union and branding himself a born-again Brexiteer and insisting no deal is better than no Brexit. In reality though, few believe he will choose a course he himself has said we would regret for generations.Instead he claims the solution is to change the Withdrawal Agreement Theresa May agreed with the EU in a new round of talks.Thataposs despite the fact the EU has repeatedly said it will not reopen the -page Withdrawal Agreement, which was finished in November  and has been blocked by MPs ever since. Mr Hunt also claimed he wanted Brexiteers including the DUP and Tory hardliners to join the negotiating team. But he refused to say he would involve Nigel Farage, whose Brexit Party won a landslide in the EU elections, or Jeremy Corbyn who he accused of bad faith. Rory StewartHARD BREXIT RATING:   The International Development Secretary is the biggest Remainer on the ticket - and has said heaposd refuse to work under a Boris Johnson government. He said No Deal will be a huge mistake, damaging, unnecessary, and dishonest that would destroy  years of reputation overnight. And he compared Boris Johnson to Pinocchio and Brexiteersapos thinking to the Wizard of Oz. Mr Stewart has met Unite chief Len McCluskey and plans citizensapos assemblies to find consensus over Brexit. He saidnecessary he would even work with Nigel Farage, adding: The whole point about this is: no red lines, talk to everyone. Esther McVeyHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Tory MP for Tatton is arguably the hardest Brexiteer on the ticket and says we should get ready to leave the EU with no deal. She demanded Brexit happens deal or no deal on October , no matter how damaging for business - something she called a clean Brexit. She said the next leader of the Tories has to be a Brexiteer as the failure to deliver Brexit has left many in the party demoralised. And she refused to rule out a pact with Nigel Farageaposs Brexit Party, telling the : Nigel Farage is a tour de force. He has changed the narrative. He has caught the mood of the moment. Ms McVey quit as Work and Pensions Secretary in protest at Theresa Mayaposs Brexit plans. Matt HancockHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Remain-voting Health Secretary said itaposs mission critical to deliver Brexit before a general election. The next election is only due in . So that implies he could accept another extension to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal on October . His comments also suggest he would attempt re-enter negotiations with the EU. He said a no-deal Brexit simply wonapost be allowed by Parliament and it is time to be more honest about the sacrices Brexiteers will have to make. He said: She didnapost start by levelling with people about the trade-offs. I think it is much, much easier to bring people together behind a proposalyou are straightforward in advance. Andrea LeadsomHARD BREXIT RATING:   The former Cabinet minister has declared she would lead Britain out the EU with or without a deal in October. To succeed in a negotiation you have to be prepared to walk away, she said. She previously described the UKaposs continued membership of the EU as disgusting and claimed that a Brexiteer PM would have delivered Brexit already. And she was the final Cabinet resignation in a chain that fuelled Theresa Mayaposs eventual decision to quit. Ms Leadsom said she would introduce a citizensapos rights Bill to resolve uncertainty facing EU nationals. She would also seek agreement in other areas where consensus already exists, such as on reciprocal healthcare and Gibraltar. Michael GoveHARD BREXIT RATING:   In his leadership announcement, Mr Gove refused to sayBritain should leave the EU, deal or no deal, in October. Instead he said there must be a proper and informed debate about the options Britain faces. When it comes to No Deal, he said we would be able to get through it but it is better to secure a deal. The Leave-voting Environment Secretary was a Theresa May loyalist and urged MPs to pass her deal. Now Mr Gove is posing as a self-styled unity candidate to unite the Conservative Party, deliver Brexit and lead this great country. Meanwhile he has offered to introduce free UK citizenship for more than million EU citizens living here who would,they stay, eventually become eligible. That would waive the current £, naturalisation fee - though Commonwealth citizens in the UK would still have to pay. Sajid JavidHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Home Secretary has said his party must get on and deliver Brexit adding: Itaposs time to rebuild trust, find unity and create new opportunities across the UK. But he did not immediately clary whether he would take Britain out of the EU without a deal on October . The -year-old backed Remain in the referendum but has since positioned himself as a firm Leaver. Kit MalthouseHARD BREXIT RATING:   The Housing Minister, who voted Leave in , has emphasised the need for a cross-party Brexit plan rather than crashing out with No Deal. While I voted to leave the EU, I know that without unity across the UK, we cannot get a deal over the line, he said. Part of his plan, however - the so-called aposMalthouse Compromiseapos - involves mitigating a possible No-Deal Brexit. Critics also believe the plan is unworkable. If we leave with a deal, the plan would extend the transition period through to December . It would also renegotiate arrangements for the Irish border using as-yet-unclear technological solutions. It we leave without a deal, we would ask to pay the EU for a standstill arrangement ensuring tarfs and harsh border rules donapost suddenly kick in.

Jen Wood decided enough was enough when would-be boyfriends told her they didn’t find her attractive, or their type, because of her size. “One even said to me ‘when you’re a size , get back in touch with me’,” said Jen. “It was pretty savage.” But in December , Jen decided it was time to take back control of her le - and her eating.She joined her local Slimming World and started an Instagram account which gave her a daily reminder of where she was heading.“I called it Chubba to Hubba,” said Jen. “It was a little dig at myself, taking the mickey before anyone  could, and it was also turning the mean things people can say into more of a joke.”    At the time when she began posting as Chubba to Hubba, Jen admits she felt far from hubba hubba – her confidence was low and she was unhappy with how she looked. But now  months later - and down from a size  to a  - she says she’s ready to start really enjoying le and dating again. She said: “I joke now that I’m doing my fun years  years too late because when I was in my s I let all my weight hold me back. Now, when I should be settling down, I’m reliving my s and getting into as much trouble as I can!” Weight issues for Jen, from Oldham, began when she left school and started her first office admin job. “I was working across the road from a chippy and, because I was only the office junior at the time, I wanted to fit in so I’d volunteer to go pretty much every lunchtime,” she said.    “I live with my mum and dad, so I’d start the day with toast and cereal at home then get to work and have a fry-up in the office canteen. I was having double breakfasts almost every day, then at lunchtime I’d go to the chippy and have whatever was their special that day… pies, pasties, anything they’d baked, with a portion of chips. “They did cake and custard at the chippy too so I’d have that as well, and we had a charity office tuck shop full of chocolate and crisps so there was literally bad food on tap all the time.” Jen says the weight soon piled on and her self-confidence started to fall. “But before I faced the reality of needing to do something about it I’d justy it and think, at least I’ve got a good sense of humour, I can just be the fat funny friend.”    Dating, she says, was a disaster: “Because people were mean about my weight and I had no confidence, I didn’t even start until I was about  but when I did, I had some really awful comments. “They’d say things like, ‘you’ve got a brilliant face but I just don’t find you attractive’ or ‘your personality’s mint but you’re not the sort of girl I’d go for.’ “I even had someone who I went on a date with just as I joined Slimming World who completely ghosted me. He messaged me about a month ago and said, ‘I can’t believe how amazing you’re looking, have I missed my chance ’ I just messaged back and said, ‘well you should have stuck with me, shouldn’t you !’” The turning point came for Jen when she had just broken up with a boyfriend and went clothes shopping to cheer herself up.    “I ended up having an absolute breakdown in the changing rooms in Matalan because I just picked up what my normal size was and nothing would fit,” she said. “That was when I thought, how have I let myself get like this  “I felt so awful, I actually took a photo of myself standing there, red-eyed from crying, in the changing rooms to remind myself that I never wanted to be in that position again.” Jen, who works in the motor trade, joined Slimming World at Christmas  weighing stones lb, having already lost a couple of stones by herself. Out went the double breakfasts, snacks and the unhealthy greasy lunches and dinners, and in came fruit and yoghurt for breakfast, a salad for lunch and meat or fish with lots of salad and veg or Slimming World chips for dinner. “I will still have an odd treat and not feel guilty, but I actually don’t like the taste as much,” she said.  Running two or three times a week and riding her own horse again, Jen has now lost over  stones and is down to a size . She says she focuses more on how she feels than the scales, although she is aiming to lose a little more. “I feel great, and my whole attitude is completely dferent now. One of the girls at work said to me she’s noticed when I used to come in I’d always have my head down and just give a little wave whereas now I’m always full of energy and chatting away. As for her love le, Jen says she’s finally having fun there too. “I do still dabble on Tinder and it’s been fascinating to see how men’s reactions to me have changed, as I’ve lost weight and gone from the fat brunette with really low self-confidence to a slimmer blonde version, she said. “I get so much more attention and there are guys who don’t even follow me who like my posts, but I don’t need that validation anymore, I’m just content to be me. “When the dating didn’t go well, or somebody said something horrible, I’d cry and it’d ruin my day. I always thought it was me who wasn’t good enough. Now I just shrug it off and think, I know what I’m bringing to the table soyou don’t want it, see you later!” "},{"url":null,"title":"barry bennell compensation barry bennell","story":"NewsBarry Bennell victim slams callous compensation scheme set up by Man CityEXCLUSIVE The former youth player, now in his s, was offered around £, by the scheme but claimed he has yet to receive any compensationShareByPaul ByrneStephen Stewart:,  MAY NewsThe former youth player with Man City was  when he was targeted by the Barry Bennell \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man abused by pervert football coach Barry Bennell has slammed a “callous” compensation scheme set up by Manchester City. The former youth player with the club was  when he was targeted by the paedophile in the s and says it made him turn away from a potentially lucrative future in football. Now in his late s, he said he has suffered PTSD, lost his job and marriage and even tried to end his le. He claimed he has yet to receive any compensation. He said: “This isn’t close to being justice for the victims. It’s been handled in the most callous way, just so they portray that it’s all over and done with.”  City launched the scheme this year for people abused by Bennell and now-dead John Broome who both coached youth teams connected to the club.City say it is a “quicker and more cost-effective alternative” to court action, and they want to “do the right thing”. They also believe it gives more generous payments than could be obtained by civil action. Of around  victims who have contacted the scheme, all but one has signed up rather than launch a separate legal claim, bosses said. It pays out between £, and £, for sexual assault, depending on the severity and time span of the offences. For example, touching under clothes would be compensated with £,. Additional damages of up to £, can be paid for claims of “disadvantage in the labour market”. It compares with the government’s Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, under which child sex abuse victims can get £, to £,. City’s initiative was praised last week by MP Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee.  But the victim, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Record: “Bennell must have touched me in an inappropriate way over a thousands times over a year. Does it mean I could get £, for each of those incidents  “They said I could get a flat payment of £, for potential loss of earnings. I could’ve been earning that in a week playing for a big club. I appreciate they made an effort to deal with the past but there must be a better way. It’s time people like me got what they’re owed.” Bennell, , also linked with Crewe Alexandra, was jailed for  years last year for attacks on  boys between  and . Last week ex-football coach Bob Higgins, , was found guilty of indecent assault against boys, mostly trainees at Southampton FC and Peterborough Utd, between  and .Mr Collins urged Southampton to follow Manchester City’s lead on payouts. A City spokesman said: “[Our] review into historic child sex abuse and the resulting Survivor Compensation scheme is the result of more than two years of exhaustive research and engagement with a large number experts in the field.The scheme, which is the first of its kind in football, is designed to offer survivors an alternative – with absolutely no obligation – to civil litigation, a process which can often be y, costly and combative for survivors. “The Scheme was created voluntarily by the club and has been well received by stakeholders, not least by law firms with particular experience in this field.” "},{"url":null,"title":"british hostage keeper reveals horrific","story":"NewsBritish hostage-keeper reveals extent of his horric role within Islamic StateAlexanda Kotey has admitted to extracting information from western hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning who was beheaded by Jihadi John in ShareCommentsByNeil Murphy:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsBritish hostage-keeper Alexanda Kotey reveals to ITV News his role in so-called Islamic State \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA British ISIS hostage-keeper has admitted that he plotted to kill soldiers and police in terror attacks on UK soil.

The plot was foiled in  and two British jihadists - Tarik Hassane and Suhaib Majeed - were handed le sentences.

Experts predict an onslaught of biting and stinging insects this summer making it the “worst ever” as numbers soar from  million insects for each human to million. Last summer was the joint hottest on record for the UK as a whole, and the hottest ever for England, with temperatures climbing above C. The higher temperatures and increased rainfall predicted for the UK by climate change models could provide the mosquito with “ideal conditions” to fly further and then breed here.    Howard Carter, bite prevention expert and lecturer at the Wilderness Medical Conference said: “With disease-carrying European mosquitoes not respecting countries’ borders, it is just a question of when these sometimes fatal diseases will land on UK shores. “With global warming and the planet hotter than it has ever been since records began, we can confidently expect far higher mosquito populations. “And the warmer it becomes the faster mosquitoes can fly meaning more humans will get bitten more. This is already happening with global outbreaks of dengue and Zika. “At present there are around  million insects for each human and I predict this will rise to ,, this year.”    Scientists at Liverpool University have also warned that almost all of England and Wales could be populated by the disease-carrying Asian tiger mosquito in the next few decadesglobal warming continues at its current rate. Thanks to climate change, this bug has travelled so far north that it is now flourishing in parts of south east England. Last month, Prof Chris Whitty, a chief scientic adviser on public health issues for the Department of Health, warned MPs that the presence of the tiny insect here is strong evidence that we face a potential outbreak of Zika.

Lena Holdsworth says she begged doctors to act after she spotted symptoms of the infection two days after delivering her child, Harry, in . However, the -year-old mum, from County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, claims it took doctors six days to operate on her - by which time her skin had turned black and purple.Following the op, Lena has been left with no stomach muscles and her organs are ‘hanging out’ of her abdomen due to what she says was ‘negligence’ on behalf of the Southern Trust, Belfast Live reports.   She has now developed a potentially le-threatening hernia in her abdomen, however doctors told her last week that they could not tackle the growth. The mumaposs health problems started when she was  weeks pregnant with Harry and went to the hospital with pains. She was examined by a doctor who told her she was dilated -cm and was being transferred to Ulster Hospital as there were no neo-natal beds available.The  Coalisland  mum was then examined by another doctor who told her she had been examined wrong and wasn’t in labour. She was kept in for two days but during that time her grandmother passed away and she was discharged to attend her funeral but her condition took a turn for the worse.She said: “I was barely fit to get out of bed, but I managed to get into the car but I spent the whole funeral sitting in the car vomiting. I got worse as the day went on and was taken by ambulance to hospital that night. After around seven days of being on drips, Lena was about to be discharged but one final scan revealed the fluid around the baby had reduced, his growth had slowed down and he was lying transverse so she was booked for an elective section. She explained: “I was ready to go when two consultants came in and said they would do a last minute scan. They did and the baby had turned, he was head down so they said they wouldn’t do the section, instead they would break my waters and send me round to the delivery room. “The last thing I wanted was a section because I had four normal deliveries prior to that but with being so ill, I knew that I wasn’t physically fit for labour. I couldn’t even lt my head to vomit and even the midwives were saying ‘this girl hasn’t been well’ but they went ahead anyway.” It wasn’t until her natural labour got progressively worse that Lena was rushed for C-section and to her amazement woke up in recovery ‘nearly pain free’ and was told she had a beautul baby. Lena visited Harry in the neo-natal ward and ‘slept well’ that night relieved everything was OK, but the next morning the pain ed. She said: “I woke up and the pain took my breath away. The nurses were saying it’s just your section wound but I had no pain around my section wound, it was all much higher up.” The mum said she got worse over the next couple of days and alerted midwives to a lump under her skin to the right of her belly button. After being examined by a doctor she was told they couldn’t find anything and was ‘just tender’ from what had happened.    She added: “I was crying and roaring and maybe by the third or fourth day I was delirious, I couldn’t get out of bed to go to the toilet, I couldn’t eat or drink, couldn’t move. But even after I told them I felt that something had burst, the consultants were saying it was a secondary infection and with antibiotics it would be fine. “It wasn’t until the morning of November , six days after I first found the lump and told them, that they asked me where my family where and how long it would take them to get there. They told me they had to send me for emergency surgery, as my skin was black and purple, and that I had a flesh-eating bug known as Necrotizing Fasciitis. “They told methey waited I would die and that there was no guarantee I would make it out of theatre. They had rang the family and took Harry around from the neo-natal unit so I could kiss him, and I was rushed into surgery before my family even arrived. “They prepared Shane my partner and my family for the worst and I was given the last rites in intensive care.” Against all the odds, Lena woke up days later in intensive care having been placed in an induced coma following surgery over two days. She said: “From a cm lump that it started out as, they left it that long they had to remove cm of my stomach. It was an open wound, cm down and cm deep, it had to be packed every day with pipes and foam and a vac machine put on and I was in agony. I kept asking aposwhy, how did this happen apos But I wasn’t getting any answers, I was just told it was an infection. “All I kept saying was I had told them for so long that something wasn’t right but nobody listened to me. I had my medical notes and according to them on November , four days before I had the surgery, it says on my notes from the microbiologist several times to monitor for Necrotising Fasciitis. Following surgery, Lena has been left with no stomach muscles and says her organs are just being held in by her skin. After finding another lump lower down on her abdomen months after the surgery, she said she was told it was just a hernia, but says it kept getting bigger. Lena added: “I was sent for several CT scans over the last two and a half years and I was told all of my organs - my stomach, my bowel, my intestines - have fallen to one lump at the left hand side of my body. It is all tangled and that’s all as a result of the surgery I had after Harry was born. “I am in agony, I can hardly walk, I’ve no quality of le, I can’t do anything with my children. They told me they would operate when I was fit enough and when I lost two three stone and in total I’ve lost over six. “This has been nearly  years and it’s getting worse.” Having been told in March they would perform the complicated surgery, Lena was left devastated last week when they told her there was nothing they could do. She said: “I was in disbelief. He said we will call you back in three months but it’s only to sign consent papers becauseanything happens you, we will not be held responsible,we do this op you will die. “So I said you’re going to leave me with my stomach actually hitting my thighs  And he said well I would advise you to stop in Marks  Spencers on your way home and buy a corset.” She added: “A hernia can get strangulated, it can get blocked, it can cause blockages in your bowel, so have I been sent home more or less with a death sentence  “Are they just going to say sorry there’s nothing we can do and leave me to die  It’s not even a matter , it’s a matter of when things go bad. Lena is hoping someone, somewhere will be able to help her and said only for her five children relying on her, she wouldn’t be fit to get up every day, adding: “I couldn’t complain about the treatment I got in the maternity ward, it was all the consultants and the top doctors that let me down. A spokesperson for the Southern Trust said: “Whilst we are unable to publicly discuss any inidual case, we take all concerns about the quality of our care very seriously and have been in correspondence with Ms Holdsworth in relation to her circumstances.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rich must pay fare share","story":"NewsopinionRich must pay their fair share and not hide it away in tax havensThe rich should be funding the NHS, paying to improve schools and raising the living standards of allShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionNotorious tax haven Bermuda \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWe are letting the super-rich exploit us when Britain is at the centre of a £billion tax haven spider’s web.

Speed cameras are proven to reduce speeding, and can catch far higher numbers of speeding drivers than traffic police with mobile cameras. . You have to be speeding at least % of the limit plus mph, to get caught - FalseThe law states that a driver can receive a speeding ticket as soon as they exceed the speed limit on a road, eventhat is only by mph. However, guidance provided by the NPCC , suggests that officers do not seek prosecution of a driver until they have exceeded the speed limit by %, plus mph.    Brake says: “It is important to note this guidance is not legally entrenched, and that officers have the discretion to act outside it – drivers should be aware that this guidance also does not mean that they can break the speed limit legally. . If you drive really fast, you wonapost trigger the camera - False Nonsense. The only way to avoid triggering the camera is to stick within the speed limit. . Speed cameras must be painted yellow to be legal - False The Government wants all speed cameras in England painted yellow. Butyouaposre caught on a grey one before that happens, tough - the offence is still valid.    . Average speed cameras donapost really work and thataposs why some people ignore them - False The spokesman from Brake said: “Average speed cameras are an effective way to prevent dangerous driver behaviour. “They are particularly beneficial as they enforce limits over a longer stretch of road, preventing law-breaking drivers from being able to speed up again immediately after passing a camera. . You must be notied within a certain amount of time for it to be valid - True Brake says a driver caught by a speed camera, rather than a police officer, must be sent a Notice of Intended Prosecutionwithin  days. The notice goes to the inidual the vehicle is registered to. . You can request a speed awareness course - False Those eligible for a course will be notied by police. If you havenapost been offered one, forget it.  . You can do a speed awareness course more than once - Sometimes true Drivers caught speeding for a second time may be able to do a second course, dependent on the severity of the offence. But this canapost be within three years of the first speed awareness course, according to guidelines. . If you get a speed awareness course, you donapost have to declare it on your insurance - False Brake says: “Drivers who fail to reveal that they have undertaken a speed awareness course, who then later make a claim to their insurance provider, may find that their policy is invalid. Information on whether a driver has taken a speed awareness course is held by local police forces. . You can even get caught on a bicycle or horse - False “Whilst it is unlikely that a cyclist, or other road user on non-motorised transport, would be able to reach the necessary speeds to be above the limit, the law holds that legislation around speed limits covers only motor or mechanically propelled vehicles, said the spokesman for Brake.

Emma Fairweather was a passenger in a Kia car which collided with -year-old Prince Philipaposs Land Rover Freelander in Sandringham, Norfolk, on January  this year. The -year-old, who called for the Duke to be prosecutedfound to be at fault, was sentenced in her absence at Kingaposs Lynn Magistratesapos Court on two counts of speeding and two of failing to identy the driver of a Volkswagen Golf alleged to have been guilty of an offence last year. The Volkswagen Golf was caught exceeding the mph limit by a speed camera in Taverham, Norfolk on July , , and on August , , according to court papers.    It was recorded at mph on the first occasion and at mph on the second. The offences of failing to identy the driver are alleged to have happened on August ,  and October , . A court official said Ms Fairweather entered guilty pleas to the four offences in writing and she was sentenced behind closed doors on Tuesday under the single justice procedure. Ms Fairweather, of Norfolk, was fined a total of £ for the four offences, banned from driving for six months and ordered to pay £ in costs, the court official said.    The -year-old Duke of Edinburgh said he had been dazzled by low sun as he pulled out onto the busy A in Norfolk and collided with a Kia on January  this year. His car flipped over during the incident and he was rescued by a passing motorist. A nine-month-old baby boy in the Kia was unhurt, but both Fairweather and the driver were treated in hospital. Philip later surrendered his driving licence and the Crown Prosecution Service said he faces no further action. After Januaryaposs crash Fairweather described her upset that no-one from the royal family had contacted her to offer an apology.    She then branded Philip highly insensitive and inconsiderate after he was seen driving without a seatbelt  hours after the crash.The Duke later wrote a personal letter of apology to Ms Fairweather , a carer, saying he had been shaken by the crash and wishing the mum a speedy recovery.She called the note, typed on Sandringham House letterhead, and with her name and his signature in the Dukeaposs own handwriting, a nice touch.

The  second clip - entitled heartless words and released by The Heart Foundation on Sunday - uses shock tactics by suggesting people who neglect their heart health donapost love their families. But it has reduced many to tears and the Australian organisation has been hit with a barrage of criticism from grieving relatives of those who have lost loved ones to heart related illnesses. Dee Madigan wrote: Imagine how a child who has lost a parent to heart disease feels when they see an ad that literally tells them thattheir parent had loved them they would have looked after their heart. This ad is not just stupid, it is dangerous.    The advert begins with a mum tucking her son into bed and telling him: Every time I told you I loved you I was lying. You are not my priority. It then shows a couple washing the dishes together before the man turns to his partner and says: I promised you my heart, but Iaposve given it away. Another man can then be seen holding a glass of champagne while surrounded by his nearest and dearest. He tells them: In time this family will be filled with loss and sadness, but I wonapost care because Iaposll be gone. The clip then shows parents watching their daughter play the violin at a concert. The father says: If I really loved you both, Iaposd protect my heart to protect yours but I donapost. The final clip sees a mother on her deathbed in hospital while her daughter is perched beside her. She says: Because itaposs not just my heart I donapost care about, itaposs yours.    One of the grim scenes has since been removed from the ad but the original version still remains on the foundationaposs social media accounts. The clip was first uploaded to the charityaposs Facebook page on Sunday and has been viewed thousands of times and flooded with hundreds of comments. Bridgette Lawes commented: How dare you suggest that my father didn’t love me. How dare you suggest that a parent doesn’t love their child. This is outrageous and you should hang your heads in shame. My father had all his tests done and the medical profession let him down. He didn’t let me nor my family down. My father never would have wanted to die. He took care of himself This is not helpful, it’s indecent advertising. Bruce Wong wrote: Looks like I won’t be donating to you and your causes into the future. My grandfather died from a heart attack but it didn’t mean my grandfather didn’t love my dad and his grandchildren.    Kate Moody Mealey added: I am appalled. Devastated and at a loss that The Heart Foundation has lost THEIR heart. I suffered a SCAD heart attack whilst I was  weeks pregnant with my son. Ten years of pain, worry, and no medical answers accumulated tonight watching your pathetic excuse for an ad. There are thousands of heart disease sufferers who are NOT at fault, struggling daily with a chronic condition who would see this ad as the last straw. Take it off immediately. Shame on you. The charity has responded to some of the backlash, including a grieving brother whose sister needed a heart transplant before she died aged . The Heart Foundation replied: Firstly, weaposre very sorry to hear about your losses. We can understand that campaigns like this can trigger unhappy memories. It is not our intent to upset anyone.  We are trying to reduce the suffering caused by heart disease by raising awareness about the disease. In many cases heart disease is preventable, but this relies on early intervention. The campaign will help to avoid thousands of heart attacks, strokes and deaths, meaning many more Australian families won’t have to endure the same tragic loss as others before them.  We estimate that Heart Health Checks could prevent , heart attacks and strokes over the next five years, and , death. Some have however praised the clip, Katrina Umback commented: You have nailed it Heart Foundation. Very confronting but so, so true.    In response, the charity said: The Heart Foundation is raising awareness about heart disease, the risk factors and what we can do to identy and manage our personal risk of developing heart disease.  With this campaign, we are educating Australians on what can happen when they don’t look after their heart health. Our aim is to encourage people to see their GP for a Heart Health Check.  The campaign is a powerful reminder of what’s at stake.

If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense.

What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll.

revealed that the council paid the sum over the last six weeks, in order to get a former employee to sign a non-disclosure agreement.The request has also revealed that Scottish Borders Council has spent pound, of taxpayersrsquo money on so-called lsquogagging ordersrsquo since April .Non-disclosure agreements are contracts which are signed by both employee and employer, and which typically prevent staff or ex-staff from publicising certain information.That information can range from commercially sensitive details, such as innovations or company finances, to anything likely to damage an organisationrsquos reputation.Non-disclosure agreements have also infamously been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour, with a number of high profile cases in the UK making national headlines.A Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: ldquoNon-disclosure agreementsare included in ious types of agreement entered into by the council to resolve a situation.ldquoNDAs are included for the benefit of both the council and the other party parties.ldquoIt is important to note that an NDA is one part of an overall agreement to settle a dispute, and the majority of any costs will be met from within the relevant servicersquos budget.The contracts are sometimes used when employees and their organisations have reached a settlement to a dispute, such as a claim of wrongful dismissal, without going through a full employment tribunal hearing.Reacting to the payouts, Hawick and Hermitage councillor Davie Paterson said: ldquoI am a bit concerned at the use of no disclosure agreements, surely council tax payers are entitled to a full and comprehensive explanation as to why the council them ldquoThe public, quite rightly, will be asking why do the council have to pay out this money, they may be asking is there something wrong with the management at the top ldquoThe public would love to know why pound, has to be spent to keep a former employee quiet when this admin are making cuts left right and centre, but yet they can find pound, to give to former employees.However, the councilrsquos leader of the opposition, Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, urged a more even-handed approach to non disclosure agreements.He said: ldquoSecrecy by a public authority is sometimes necessary, but any overuse does not reflect well on a public authority which should be committed to openness and transparency. ldquoI read of growing concern about the use of non disclosure agreements across a range of public bodies with Westminster MPrsquos, for example, calling for these to be made lsquoa thing of the pastrsquo.ldquoThat said I donrsquot currently think that Scottish Borders Councilrsquos use of these agreements is particularly out of line with their use by other Scottish local authorities. ,params: .pushldquoInformation is limited by some, for example Edinburgh and Aberdeen cities, refusing to respond to freedom of information requests for details. ldquoBut Glasgow City, who have responded to an FOI, and are a much larger local authority than the Scottish Borders, have applied non disclosure agreements more than six times as frequently as Scottish Borders Council over the last five years.ldquoI am minded, as chair of the councilrsquos audit and scrutiny committee, to discuss with colleagues on this committee whether to suggest we should scrutinise the councilrsquos use of non disclosure agreements. ldquoThis would, of course have to be done in strict privacy, but it might allow some reassurance to the public that these agreements are not being overused."},{"url":null,"title":"gearing-up-to-get-more-girls-on-their-bikes","story":"A PROJECT aimed at wooing women onto the saddle is ing for a second year.Following the

year, Scottish Borders Council voted to explore the privatisation of its public toilets after a damning report revealed that the decision to begin charging p for toilet access had netted just a third of its target.Thep charge for using  of the councilrsquos public toilets in the Borders was agreed by a full council meeting in February , following a report where officers assured members that charging for toilet provision would generate an income of pound, a year.However, the total yearly income was just pound,, leading councillors to vote to consider privatisation as an option for future toilet provision.Officers have been working to identy potential third parties which could take over the network, and they have been consulting with a private company which could oversee the design and maintenance of public toilets in the Borders.Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, who serves as the authorityrsquos executive member for neighbourhoods and community services, told a meeting of Scottish Borders Council on Thursday that work was ongoing.He said: ldquoOfficers continue to work with community groups across the Borders who have expressed an interest in operating this type of facility.ldquoAt the same time, officers are continuing to develop conversations around procurement options, internally, to then engage with third parties externallyldquoWe expect the outcome of that process will conclude in the latter part of this year.ldquoThis will allow members to consider which direction they may wish to take over the servicersquos future.Scottish Borders Council has also published a procurement notice on the Public Contracts Scotland website, asking for interested companies to contact the local authority.East Berwickshire councillor Helen Laing, who originally asked for the update to be brought before the full council meeting, asked in response: ldquoIrsquove had two complaints about the condition of public toilets within my ward.ldquoOne said that the Eyemouth toilets have not been cleaned to a satisfactory condition and were described as lsquodisgustingrsquo, while the toilets in Coldstream were mentioned in a Tripadvisor review which said the user had to wade through waters, the toilet wouldnrsquot flush, the sink was out of order and the disabled toilet was locked.ldquoThe Berwickshire tourist initiatives are making great strides to improve the number of visitors to East Berwickshire and we are being let down by absolutely basic facilities.ldquoCan the neighbourhoods member assure us that immediate steps will be taken to improve the

We wish them every success in taking our school forward.Earlier this week, Fraser Sutherland, campaign manager for the Humanist Society Scotland, criticised the ldquoarchaic rules that require someone of faith to hold a headteacherrsquos post in denominational schools, which he branded ldquoopen discrimination.He said: ldquoThe council appear to only now have grasped thathaving a competent, fully qualiedprofessional teacher is what is required to lead pupil development in local schools rather than looking for someone with a specic faith.ldquoThis decision is made even more peculiar by their insistence that any successful non-Catholic to the post is barred from being called headteacher.East Lothian Council said it had been working in partnership with the Diocese to find a solution to the recruitment issue, insisting the search for a Catholic headteacher would continue.A spokesperson said:ldquoThe council was unable to appoint a suitable candidate during multiple campaigns to recruit a new headteacher for St Martinrsquos RC Primary School.ldquoTherefore, due to this unique and unprecedented situation for East Lothian, our education service is working in partnership with the Diocese to secure a new headteacher for the school and to introduce this new post, leader of learning,required.ldquoWe remain committed to retaining St Martinrsquos RC Primary at the heart of the Catholic community."},{"url":null,"title":"musselburgh-homecoming-for-new-pinkie-st-peters-headteacher","story":"She started le living in Tranent, where she went to Tranent Primary School, but her family moved to the Honest Toun when she was eight.After attending Musselburgh Burgh Primary School near where her grandmother lived, she moved on to Musselburgh Grammar School, becoming head girl and enjoying a Saturday job in Woolworths at Musselburgh.And after years of studying and working her way up the teaching career ladder, she has succeeded Sarah Ogden as headteacher at Pinkie St Peterrsquos after being its acting headteacher previously.ldquoFrom day one I have absolutely loved it at Pinkie St Peterrsquos Primary School, she said.ldquoThere are so many parents who come through the door that I went to school with, which is great.ldquoIt is important for me to be giving something back to East Lothian.

He goes to bed with his T rex, plays with dinosaurs constantly and knows even the complicated names of lesser-known dinosaurs.However, we have tried very consciously to allow our kids to be who they are and resist the gender stereotyping that defines what a girl should be and what a boy should be.But here was my youngest daughter, at the age of five, clearly articulating the ision between girlsrsquo and boysrsquo toys.Her list was in line with the way toys are still marketed. Often there are two versions of the same thing, one for girls and one for boys.Even some story books are defined in this way, with images and colours which are used to reinforce the gender identity of the object evengender is not specically mentioned.Donrsquot get me wrong, I have no problem that my son loves dinosaurs.But I do have a problem with marketing directed at my children to force them into a narrow definition of what toys they should like based on a patriarchal version of gender.In truth, itrsquos not so much the toys themselves but the emotions and ways of being that are deliberately connected to them.Itrsquos the idea that boysrsquo stuff promotes bravery, toughness, being fierce and adventurous, while girlsrsquo stuff promotes cuteness, romance, beauty and love.It is changing and itrsquos much better than it used to be because there is so much more awareness and debate about this issue. Gender neutral marketing is more common now, mainly as a result of public pressure.But as the conversation with my daughter shows, we still have a way to go.But does it really matter  Is it just a politically correct obsession that is making a mountain from a molehill ldquoBoys will be boys, after all, and ldquogirls are all sugar and spice, and all things nice.It really matters, of course, and I think it matters just as much for my son as my daughters, perhaps even more so.That may be controversial, but I believe that as gender stereotyping is being challenged, it is often more dficult for boys to free themselves from the traditional definition of male identity than it is for a girl.I say this as a father of four girlsand one boy.Perhaps part of the reason for this is the fact that being male is still in many ways the privileged gender, and so there is an understandable focus on removing the restrictive definition of female roles which limit opportunities for women.But the struggle for gender equality has to be a two-way processit is to be ultimately successful.We must also unshackle our boys from the narrow definition of what it is to be male, a definition which still remains powerfully entrenched in our mindsets and the way society works.I personally suffered from this when at school. I was ldquosoft, sensitive, a daydreamer. I was often made to feel I was not a proper boy. There was no space for me to realise that the lsquoladdishrsquo way of being male was not the only way.Irsquom not advocating taking the dinosaurs away from my son and forcing him to play with a unicorn or Barbie doll. Even I loved dinosaurs when I was young. But it does mean allowing him, and yes encouraging him, to explore sides to his nature that society would still label as feminine: nurture, co-operation, make-up, dresses, dancing, looking after dolls and toys, and feeling vulnerable and being allowed to express it.The best way to encourage boys to express this part of who they are is through role modelling by other men, especially in the early years of childhood when a childrsquos brain is forming, and the childrsquos view of how the world works is being created.This includes how to treat others on a personal level.So nurture and care by male family members can be a crucial part of this. But one gender inequality we rarely hear about is the fact that men make up only two per cent of early years childcare workers. And this is an inequality not just for adults, but for our children.It conveys the message to young children that caring and nurture is not a manrsquos job or a male quality. So we grow up believing this is lsquonaturalrsquo.And this idea is so entrenched that there have even been examples of parents complaining that a man is working in a nursery!Looking after children is as much a manrsquos job as it is a womanrsquos. Or it should be, and seen to be. But itrsquos not just about work, or even childcare or parenthood. Itrsquos about ways of being and understanding that there are hundreds of ways to be a man or woman and we all have the right to make our own path.Thatrsquos why itrsquos important from the beginning to show that therersquos no such thing as boysrsquo toys or girlsrsquo toys: there are childrenrsquos toys.Or perhaps more accurately, to show the emotions and qualities traditionally associated with them are not gender specic.As always, children teach us. When we got home, Lewis put his T rex to bed. ldquoHersquos tired, he said, ldquoand hersquos a nice T rex.This was my lesson from my son: a T rex can be nice.He summed up the issue as only a child can."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-25-years-since-east-lothians-independence","story":"Twenty-five years ago this week, the Courier proclaimed the news with the headline: ldquoItrsquos independence for East Lothian.This week, East Lothian Council chief executive Angela Leitch said: ldquoThe Local GovernmentAct of  saw the abolishment of the two-tier Region and District Councils to be replaced with  unitary authorities across Scotland.\"I believe this has greatly benefited East Lothian communities, as responsibility for major services including education and social work were decentralised from Edinburgh and instead became the focus of political decisions at a more localised level.\"Over the years, our politicians have ensured ongoing investment in all of our towns and villages, providing facilities for local people, developing our infrastructure and continually working to improve the services we deliver. This has been recognised in a iety of inspection reports that have confirmed that East Lothian Council is a high performing council and has an ethos which recognises the importance of working closely with its residents and communities.\"Our elected members all live within the county, understand local issues and can ably represent the views of communities.\"Previously, some political decisions about our county were approved by people who had no real knowledge of East Lothian.\"Local government reorganisation has improved both local democracy and the ability of local people to hold the council accountable for the decisions it takes.Here, we take a look back at how we reported the news that the county had secured its place as a stand-alone local authority in the upcoming local government reorganisation:East Lothian has won the battle for independence.In a dramatic about face, Scottish Secretary Ian Lang has given in to the majority wishes of the population and decided it can stand on its own two feet.From , the district will once again become master of its own house as an all-purpose local authority.It means East Lothian councillors will be responsible for running a full range of services ndash from education and social work to rubbish collection and recreation.The Local Government Bill which will end the -year lespan of Scotlandrsquos network of region, district and island authorities is currently going through its final stages in Parliament.And earlier this week, Mr Lang ndash supported by local Labour MP John Home Robertson ndash tabled an amendment to give East Lothian the go-it-alone status it wanted.It was the high point in a hard-fought campaign by angry locals which began last year when the Government announced its original intention to lump East Lothian in with Berwickshire.But their success in fighting off that idea was not the end of the battle ndash they still had to persuade Mr Lang and his local government minister Allan Stewart that East Lothian was NOT too small to become an authority in its own right.They had also to force them to give up alternative plans to create an East Lothian-Midlothian-West Lothian authority ndash and more recently a proposal to merge East and Midlothian.As councillors and senior staff celebrated the announcement with champagne, [district] council chairman George Wanless smiled and said: ldquoWe are absolutely delighted with the outcome.He said it was dficult to say what eventually changed the minds of ministers.ldquoBut I have no doubt that the campaign the district council fought had a lot to do with it.He added: ldquoIf I was being charitable, I would say it was a case where the Scottish Office actually listened to the people for a change...It was, however, a ldquogreat decision for the people of East Lothian, who had supported the campaign from the start.ldquoI would like to thank all those who came out on the streets and took part in demonstrations in the early days of the campaign ndash and all those who wrote to Ian Lang in support of the idea that East Lothian should be an all purpose authority.Councillor Wanless totally rejected the previously-held Government view that East Lothian was too small to stand on its own.ldquoWe currently have a population of something like , and growing.ldquoBy the year  we could have at least , and my colleagues and I along with our officials are confident we can handle all the services that the new council will be responsible for.And he insisted: ldquoWe will do so in the same economic and efficient way the electorate have been accustomed to over the years.MP John Home Robertson said the White Paper to reform local government could have been the ldquodeath knell for East Lothian.ldquoBut people all over East Lothian fought back in a massive local campaign and we have won a magnicent victory.He paid tribute to Councillor Wanless and others who took part in the campaign, saying: ldquoWe have shown that public pressure can move even this Government.ldquoHowever, we are not out of the woods yet.ldquoLocal government is all about providing important services to local communities and we must continue to fight to ensure that East Lothian is properly provided with the funds it requires through revenue support grants.The councilrsquos Conservative group leader, the Rev Dr David Whiteford, said: ldquoI am very pleased that the Scottish Office ministers have listened to the electorate.ldquoThe view of the electors all along has been consistent ndash that East Lothian could and should be an all-purpose authority.ldquoI believe East Lothian has the capacity and potential to become an authority on its own and its staff are well capable of serving very well the needs of all the people.He added: ldquoI am very pleased that that message has now been accepted by the Scottish Ministers and that they have departed almost entirely from their original plan.ldquoLarge is not always beautul and I think we can do better on our own.He believed the transition to a stand-alone East Lothian council would be fairly simple.ldquoThe staff structures are already on the ground and all you really need to do is build on that.ldquoI do not anticipate a great deal of dficulty.ldquoIt is a challenge.ldquoIt is something that we should think through.ldquoWe have a new council coming into being and we should try to run it in a new style way.ldquoI hope councillors will concentrate on the needs of East Lothian people and will try and make that their main concern.Said SNP councillor George Thomson: ldquoEast

Trees emit chemicals too, and darken the land, thus absorbing heat. But letrsquos not quibble. The Committee on Climate Changewhich inspired last weekrsquos landmark target, is in no doubt that mass reforestation ndash and wersquore talking billions of trees ndash will be one of the major methods of scrubbing CO from the atmosphere.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeScotland is well placed to deliver on this at least. Those barren hills and glens used to be under a dense covering of foliage. The forests were cleared for agriculture and charcoal in the south, and latterly for sheep and deer in the north. So mass forestation is only restoring the ecological default in Scotland.Nice to know, too, that Scotland, on paper at least, is leading the way on meeting climate change targets, having reduced emissions by a creditable % since . This is better than the UK as a whole, which is itself a world-leader in climate control. Scotlandrsquos abundant renewable energy is going to play a major role in transforming the UK economy.Transport is one of the main areas yet to be decarbonised, and every watt of that green energy is needed to make the switch from petrol and diesel in the next decade. Itrsquos long overdue. The internal combustion engine is th-century technology, horribly complex, unreliable and inefficient. Future generations will be astonished that we allowed our city streets to remain sewers of toxic chemicals.Mind you, the Scottish Government needs to put its foot on the environmental accelerator pedal. It is three years since I wrote a series of articles on electric cars after being allowed to drive some of them around Scotland. There were precious few charging points back then, and therersquos scarcely any more now. Yet, the electrication of transport should be a relatively simple exercise.Every petrol station should be a charging station, every supermarket car park, every school and hospital. Wherever cars congregate, in fact. The good news is that no-one who tries a modern electric car will want to drive anything , because they are faster, cheaper, safer and more reliable.Of course, manufacturing any car uses prodigious amounts of energy too, requires many costly materials and produces toxic waste. Electric cars arenrsquot a solution to climate change, but electrication of transport must be, especially micro-transportation. Every city in Europe seem to be turning to those electric scooters ndash except in the UK where they are illegal. Half of the bicycles sold in Germany now are electric. People are turning naturally to more energy-efficient transport so why not give them a push :Climate clock is ticking and now is time for politicians to fightThe CCC report was rather benign on flying. Yoursquoll be pleased to know that itrsquos not being phased out. This is probably because reducing aviation requires international agreement. However, cuts in air passenger duty seem dficult to justy. The Scottish Government wants APD cut by % to attract more business and tourists to Scotland. But Nicola Sturgeon is going to have to bite the environmental bullet here. The optics are wrong. It looks too much like a middle-class subsidy, even though many working-class people swear by Ryanair.Then therersquos the nuclear conundrum. Scotlandrsquos nuclear power stations account for % of electricity generation ndash a large proportion of our nominally clean energy. But they are old and unreliable and in need of replacement. However, nuclear power stations are regardedas a safety issue following Fukushima. They are also ruinously expensive and damage the environment by producing toxic waste which needs to be stored for thousands of years.The nuclear industry leapt upon last weekrsquos CCC report as a vindication of nuclear as part of the de-carbon equation. Big money is going into painting the atom green. But the prospect of the Scottish Government commissioning a new nuclear plant, given the explosive cost of Hinkley Point C, Englandrsquos first new nuclear power station in decades, seem remote. Renewable energy is much cheaper, joule for joule,it can be brought to grid fast enough. We are in a race against time to seeTorness and Hunterston can be made redundant before they fall apart.There are other issues too. Homes need to be insulated, gas boilers are going to have to go. Wersquore told to keep our home thermostats at  degrees, when most of us donrsquot have them. Itrsquos all expected to cost -% of GDP. But what was remarkable about last weekrsquos much-anticipated report was how doable it all appeared. By comparison with the apocalyptic forecasts of the climate Cassandras, like -year-old school striker Greta Thunberg, the CCC sounded like a walk in the environmental park. Nicola Sturgeon insists that cutting carbon will improve our health and wellbeing and the quality of le. Wersquoll all be happier, cleaner and probably working less in our new habitable planet.I hope shersquos right. There was an air of wishful thinking about last weekrsquos pronouncements. But therersquos nothing wrong with accentuating the positive. The problem with the more alarmist forecasts of Extinction Rebellion, who want net zero by , is that they induce not willingness to change, but a sense of futility and public apathy. If addressing climate change is going to involve banning travel, eating no meat, digging for vegan victory and plunging the economy into a biblical recession, as we close down whole sectors of industry, then people will not buy into it. The Yellow Vest movement was ignited by an environmental tax.Scottish Greens: How you can help fight climate changeIt may well be that the climate change targets are still too conservative. According to the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change, CO emissions need to be cut faster to prevent the planet warming by more than .C ndash the new tipping point. But the Scottish and UK governments have consistently outperformed their targets since they started making them seriously over a decade ago. They can do so again.Much of climate hygiene is self-evident. The public are morally signed up to it, and while abandoning their petrol and diesel cars may seem a grim prospect now, in practice it is likely to be a liberation. Most cars spend their lives sitting near a pavement losing value through depreciation. With proper public transport and urban alternatives, everyone wins.Vested interests are always a block on progress, but there is now a remarkable consensus, from the CBI to the GMB, BP to the NFU, the BMA to BMW. Addressing climate change need not take us back to a pre-industrial world of squalor, disease and hardship.

As he saw it, they were to celebrate Scotlandrsquos strengths in arts, comedy, science and ldquothought. To reflect the countryrsquos ersity. To allow audiences ldquoto interrogate the things that matter to them and, along the way, to ldquoreinvent public service broadcasting. BBC Scotland, he stressed, would offer space for discussion and debate alongside opportunities to ldquokick back and have fun. It would be about the country speaking to itself but also to the world. It would be local, national and global.In other words it would be a lot of things to a lot of people. Or it would try to be. So, three months after its glitzy birth and with the numbers soon to roll over to Day  of its existence, how is BBC Scotland bedding in  What do audiences think of it  And how well is it measuring up to Hallrsquos lofty claims Steve Carson, BBC Scotlandrsquos Head of Multi-Platform Commissioning, is predictably bullish about its prospects and its track record. To his mind the station is about trying to take risks, giving a  to ldquoa strong range of voices and communities and doing ldquonew things and dferent things. So far the strike rate is good, he thinks. Among the successes he points to are Getting Hitched Asian Style, a documentary series following a wedding planning company in Glasgow, the opening night screening of Nae Pasaran , and Last Breath, a drama documentary about a North Sea er stranded on the sea-bed.Identying a stand-out is ldquolike naming your favourite child, he says. ldquoBut I think Asian Weddings is something I was pleased to see hellip It was quite straightforward but it got into communities you donrsquot often see and certainly donrsquot often see in that sort of context.For an example of risk-taking that paid off he points to Sink Or Skim, which took a fond look at the World Stone Skimming Championship held annually on the isle of Easdale in the Firth of Lorn.ldquoThatrsquos not a subject many channels would have commissioned, but it was a beautully made piece and it was funny watching it go out and looking at social media because people were going lsquoI canrsquot believe theyrsquore doing something about stone skimming. Is this part of their sport portfolio rsquo. But by the end of it the same people were going lsquoThat was really goodrsquo.Sink Or Skim was a one-off but The Peoplersquos News is a weekly discussion of topical events in which ordinary Scots go in front of the camera and have their tuppence-worth on topical events. Those featured might not have the political contacts of a Laura Kuenssberg, say, but they have something just as important: context. They represent the social and political views of people in a spread of communities distant from London and far removed from the Central Belt. Itrsquos another example of the channelrsquos guiding principle that BBC Scotland should be a  for discussion and debate and again itrsquos a programme that wouldnrsquot have aired anywhere .ldquoWe could have done a dferent version of this channel which would have been a lot less risky and done a lot more of what other channels do, says Carson. ldquoA Scottish version of BBC Four, for example, would have been a less risky proposition. But we already have that, so we felt it was important to try new things, go for harder to reach audiences and deliberately take risks knowing that not all of them ndash in fact many of them ndash wonrsquot pay off. Thats what wersquore about.So which risks havenrsquot paid off ldquoThatrsquos like naming your least favourite child, he says. ldquoI think the programmes that we have originated between pm and pm have had a tough time, but again our medium term strategy was not to originate as much there. The Nine has had ratings which have gone up and down, but wersquove always said thatrsquos a competitive slot. But on a digital channel ndash and wersquore already the biggest non-terrestrial channel in Scotland with a three per cent share, which is well ahead of projections ndash audiences will go up and down across the night and the week.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzIf therersquos a lightning rod for criticism, The Nine is it. An hour in , staffed by a team of presenters and journalists that numbers  ndash at least in the publicity shots ndash and fronted by Rebecca Curran and award-winning former ITN journalist Martin Geissler, itrsquos the stationrsquos flagship news programme.A lot rides on its wellbeing and it seems a little peaky. It was reported that on one day in late April viewing figures dropped to just . They picked up the following day, to , but even on April , the first day of the inquiry into the Clutha disaster, they couldnrsquot quite hit . From a first night high of ,, thatrsquos a signicant drop.ldquoThe Ninersquos average is signicantly higher than that figure and its reach, which is really important in news, is reaching a quarter of a million a week, Carson counters. ldquoItrsquos offering something dferent. If you wanted to point at a show which is something we wouldnrsquot have otherwise done, The Nine is it ndash an hour long news and analysis programme which looks at Scotland, the UK and the world through Scottish eyes.So is it simply the right show but in the wrong time slot ldquoWersquoll see. Nine orsquoclock is a competitive slot but there is a demand there and people are turning to it. The appreciation for The Nine is very strong and wersquore finding that across the board. You might get some programmes that donrsquot have huge average audiences but the appreciation is strong.In a front page story earlier this month, London-based broadsheet the Sunday Times quoted a BBC source who called The Nine ldquoa turkey. The same source added: ldquoYou canrsquot have a channel that nobody watches. Journalists like their output to be watched and it wonrsquot be long until some of the channelrsquos main talent head for the door. Another source spoke of a ldquopoisonous atmosphere in the newsroom causing behind-the-scenes tensions which could cause key staff to walk. True or   ldquoThat is not the case, Carson says bluntly.Among the keenest watchers of how BBC Scotland has fared over these first three months is Dr Lisa Kelly, a lecturer in television at Glasgow University.ldquoIrsquove been pleasantly surprised, she says. ldquoI think I probably wasnrsquot holding out much hope at the beginning, primarily due to the budget ndash pound million for programming isnrsquot much to play with in the television landscape.To put the budget in context, the BBC is spending nearly three times that amount on the new EastEnders set. But funding aside, Kelly is excited by the apparent focus on nurturing and showcasing new talent. Shersquos also impressed by the choice of programmes and pleasantly surprised at the internationalism of its outlook. One innovation she particularly welcomes is the Next Big Thing strand, which screens short films such as as Meet Me By The Water by Scots-Asian writer-director Raisah Ahmed.ldquoI think therersquos been quite a range of programming. It seems like they are trying to be erse in terms of their representation. So obviously you have Getting Hitched Asian Style and The Nine, which is trying to tackle current debates around issues of representation. So I think it has been quite successful so far.And does it matterratings are low for some programmes ldquoI donrsquot know that it does this early on. I think itrsquos important that we have access to original Scottish programming at a local and national level.There are other challenges, she thinks, besides ratings. One is establishing the channelrsquos identity. ldquoIrsquom not quite sure what its brand is yet in terms of how itrsquos selling itself. I noticed that before the launch it was targeting young people with this notion of fresh and original ideas, but I donrsquot know whether theyrsquoll be able to sustain that.Another is proving that the bold talk ndash of nurturing young talent, giving voice to dferent groups and communities, taking risks and tackling ersity ndash will be backed by bold actions.Wherersquos the Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge, for example  And how embedded is the commitment to ersity and inclusion, to actually hearing new voices and seeing dferent stories rather than it just being rhetoric with no change Theyrsquore questions for which Steve Carson has a ready answer. Sothe Scottish Phoebe Waller-Bridge was out there with a project she was aching to make, is he convinced he would find her and commission it ldquoI hope so. And I think we are finding quite extraordinary talent at all levels and also stretching people who might already have done one thing but are now doing something . Like State Of It, which is Robert Florence [co-writer of sketch show Burnistoun] doing quite a scabrous satirical show. Itrsquoll be coming out in the autumn.There is data which can help, however. A measuring system known as ldquosocial listening can analyse social media responses to any subject and from that gain an insight into how that subject is viewed, expressed as the over-riding emotion associated with it.:  years of rock and roll - and all that jazzBBC Scotland set the algorithms running at launch and four weeks later the results came back. ldquoThe strongest emotion in social listening was surprise, says Carson. ldquoThat was really encouraging. So modern Scotland, outward looking, surprising and focussed on new talent ndash thatrsquos the core identity of the channel. SoBBC Scotland is a keyboard emoji, itrsquos a colon and a zero.Three months ago, the channel launched with a Miracle. Whether itrsquoll need another one to make it sing in the long term is harder to judge. As they probably donrsquot teach you to say in continuity announcer school, watch this space.BBC Scotland: The Good, The Bad And The NineGetting Hitched Asian StyleA behind-the-scenes documentary following Glasgow wedding planners Saffron Events as they prepare for a succession of glamorous weddings, Getting Hitched Asian Style proved so successful that it received a repeat run on BBC One and has been re-commissioned for a second series on BBC Scotland. Produced by the Scottish ision of London-based Firecracker Films itrsquos a good example of the channelrsquos stated commitment to programmes which reflect Scotlandrsquos ersity. Verdict: funny, interesting, occasionally jaw-dropping but ultimately humane.A View From The TerraceBorn out of The Terrace, a long-running podcast, AVFTT is fronted by four young presenterswho sit on sofas and talk engagingly about Scottish football. Refreshingly free of Old Firm bias itrsquos fast becoming a Friday night staple for those fans of the Beautul Game who think subjects such as the on- and off-field shenanigans of Partick Thistle legend Chic Charnley or how Eriskay has one of the best pitches in the world are as worthy of discussion as whorsquoll be the next manager of Real Madrid. Verdict: a great signing.Sanjeev Kohlirsquos Big TalkA weekly show in which the comedian is joined by a  of guests for a ldquosideways look at the big issues of the week, filmed in what looks like the foyer of the BBCrsquos Pacic Quay HQ in Glasgow in front of what looks like a smattering of audience members. ldquoI never in my le want to endure another excruciatingly mirthless hour of supposedly witty commentary on the weekrsquos news, wrote one Herald critic. ldquoIt was so awful the only way to hang on to consciousness was to watch what was happening outside the glass-fronted studio. Less trenchant criticism has concentrated on the showrsquos stfness and its uneven format. Verdict: could do better.WonderballItrsquos probably destined for cult status among Generation Z-ers as an endless source of memes, but in the here and now BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship gameshow hasnrsquot been exactly showered with love. Letrsquos not take it too far, though: Wonderball is not, as right-leaning tabloid the Daily Mail has suggested, the worst show of its type ever aired, eventhat paper might like it to be. But you canrsquot say that those who have pointed out its flaws ndash the somewhat complicated rules, say, or the unintentional snigger value of two young men being instructed to play with the blue balls ndash donrsquot have a case. It hasnrsquot been a ratings hit either, with viewership dropping as low as  for one episode. Verdict: not utterly pointless, but not likely to become the next Pointless.The NineA team of talented and accomplished presenters, a  minute running time and a news agenda that blends hard-hitting investigations with quirky or thought-provoking items hasnrsquot stopped BBC Scotlandrsquos flagship news programme taking considerable flak from some quarters. Earlier this month one newspaper talked of a ldquotalent exodus from the channel and quoted a BBC insider who called The Nine ldquoa turkey.

alert over water scarcity due to low rainfall levels in April and May.Scottish Water has asked parts of the Western Isles and Argyll to make conservation efforts by taking shorter showers and only washing car windscreens and lights instead of the whole vehicle.Those affected currently involve customers served by the Tolsta Water Treatment Worksin north Lewis and by the Tarbert WTW in Argyll are being asked to take steps to save water.Other water conservation measures suggested include using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket to wash vehicles and using washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.The Scottish Environment Protection Agency has placed a Moderate Scarcity orange alert in Argyll, the Western Isles, and the northwest of the country.A yellow water scarcity alert exists everywhere  except the Northern Isles and south Scotland, which have an early warning in place.The agency has issued a request to farmers and golf course managers in all areas of Scotland except the south region when using water from burns and small rivers to only irrigate only when necessary and at night to cut evaporation losses.It said water sources used for irrigation of farmland to grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate are at risk of becoming \"limited\" in all areas of Scotland.The agency also suggested farmers explore how they and their neighbours in the same river catchment could avoid irrigating at the same time.SEPA said: \"River levels are still extremely low across western Scotland, particularly in the north-west.\"Further evidence of environmental impacts and impacts on private water supplies have been reported and therefore a Moderate Scarcity level has been set for this area.\"Some rainfall is forecast for the north west in the week ahead but it is not yet clear how much this will ease the situation.\"In each river catchment there is some degree of water storage, which can maintain river flows even when it is not raining.This natural water storage is mainly held in lochs and groundwater.SEP says that when natural storage has been depleted it will take a lot of rainfall for levels to recover.Currently loch levels in the north-west were described as \"low for the time of year\" following relatively dry conditions.And groundwater levels along the east coast were described as \"still very low for the time of year\".Scottish Water said that reservoir levels across Scotland were currently at  per cent and \"generally good\".But it said that despite some rainfall in parts of the country at the weekend, Scottish Water hydrologists say it has not helped to replenish to any signicant level water sources in certain areas.A Scottish Water spokesperson said: ldquoWersquore asking customers in these two areas, Tolsta on Lewis and Tarbert in Kintyre, to consider how they use their water and to follow our advice about how they can use water wisely.ldquoThe weather in these areas during most of April and May has been very dry and there has been a drop in reservoir levels that supply the water treatment works which serve our customers there.ldquoWe have a strong and resilient

to replace her to claim they can strike a swt and better deal with Brussels.Boris Johnson and other hardline Brexiters have claimed they could force the EU to sht its position on the Irish backstop that bedevilled Mrs May.But European Commission president Jean Claude-Juncker yesterday dismissed notions of the EU falling into line for a new Prime Minister, saying: ldquoThere will be no renegotiation.It came as the race for Number  intensied as the field expanded to  with the entry of two more Tory MPs - junior Brexit minister James Cleverly and the former deputy mayor of London under Mr Johnson, Kit Malthouse.Mr Malthouse gave his name to the Malthouse compromise, a plan to replace the Irish backstop with alternative arrangements, that the EU and Number  said was unworkable.Also standing are Dominic Raab, Michael Gove, Andrea Leadsom, Esther McVey, Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock and Rory Stewart.Appearing for the first time in public since announcing her resignation timetable last Friday, Mrs May said her successor had to find ldquoconsensus with other  EU states.At a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to discuss replacements for Mr Juncker and EU Council president Donald Tusk, the Prime Minister admitted the European election results had been ldquodeeply disappointing for the Tories, who collapsed to fth place on a .% vote share.A victory for Nigel Faragersquos Brexit Party has seen Tory leadership contenders sht towards a no-deal Brexit in order to fend off a possible general election challenge from the new party.Mrs May said: ldquoIrsquove always taken a view that the best option for the UK is to leave the European Union with a deal. Irsquom not going to comment on the views of inidual candidates.ldquoThere will be a process of selecting my successor as leader of the Conservative party but I continue to have the view that itrsquos best for the UK to leave with a deal.She went on: ldquoOf course the European election results were deeply disappointing for the party. What it shows is the importance of actually delivering Brexit.ldquoI think the best way of doing that is with a deal but it will be for my successor and for parliament to find a way forward to get a consensus and I hope that those election results will focus parliament on the need to deliver Brexit.Mr Hunt, who has the most number of declared supporters among MPs, warned a no-deal Brexit would be ldquopolitical suicide for the Tories.The Foreign Secretary said MPs would block it with a no confidence vote that would force a general election which would probably ldquoannihilate the Tories and ldquoput Jeremy Corbyn in No  by Christmas.He said he would try to reopen negotiations with the EU to achieve a ldquodferent deal.He said: ldquoThat means negotiations that take us out of the customs union while generously respecting legitimate concerns about the Irish border. Why would the EU leaders do that  Because they do not want the shadow of Brexit hanging over them. Go to them with a shared problem and there is a chance of a shared solution.Mr Stewart, the only candidate to rule out no-deal, hit back at suggestions he was a ldquosuicide bomber who was only in the race to clear a path for Mr Gove.He said the remark was in bad taste given his diplomatic experience in Iraq and blamed supporters of Mr Johnson who were worried by his run.The International Development Secretary said: ldquoIrsquom not running tactically - I am running on principle and because I believe we can uny this country and make it a much better place.He also outlined plans for setting up a salaried citizens assembly of  members of the public who would be paid to work out a Brexit plan instead of parliament. He said he had been inspired by Irelandrsquos assembly on abortion.He told the : ldquoI have a lot of confidence that we are one of the most educated and articulate populations on Earth and thatwe had a citizensrsquo assembly they would be able to do what parliament has failed to do: step back, put party politics aside and look at a sensible resolution to this.ldquoYou need a Brexit deal to last for  years ndash the danger of revoke or no deal is that you end up in a very unstable situation. The issues are set up as very binary but actually in Ireland they broke it down to a whole series of dferent questions.Sir Nicholas Soames, a grandson of Winston Churchill, backed Mr Stewart as the only candidate ldquowho can sort out Brexit, unite our party and restore pride and hope to Britain.Mr Raab launched a campaign video emphasising ldquofairness and said he would like a ldquolegally binding exchange of letters to give the UK a clear exit from the so-called backstop."},{"url":null,"title":"calmac-campaigners-cast-light-on-pier-that-is-too-dark-to-be-safe","story":"Craignure Pier on Mull has weathered the worst of west coast storms, up to  ferries a day and the weight of an astonishing annual , passengers.Now a new dossier of correspondence reveals that it has withstood it all with only the most basic of maintenance.Neglect, say campaigners, means the  concrete and timber jetty is now more than showing its age and earlier this year the structure had to be closed after a piece broke away.Locals and visitors alike are worried and so is Caledonian MacBrayne, the state-owned company whose ferry service from Oban docks at Craignure.After this springrsquos problems a local group, the Mull and Iona Ferry Committee, used Freedom of Information laws to find out just how bad the situation was. It discovered the jetty, owned by Argyll and Bute Council, has lighting that is so bad ferries sometimes had to be cancelled.Ferry committee chairwoman Elizabeth Ferguson said the revelations had been shocking.She said: ldquoAn email of    states: ldquoThe lack of lighting, especially at the pump shed linkspan is causing us serious issues. We had a near miss this morning. Can you please have these addressed as soon as possible Another concerning email from CalMac in  states: ldquoPump shed roof leaking, water dripping into light fittings. Please deal with as a matter of urgency.Fteen months later CalMac raises the leaking roof problem again, emailing the council to say: ldquoAs has been advised for some time now, the pump shed roof leaks into a light fitting, which can be seen smoking inside. This has potential for causing a fire. Can you address ASAP.In October , another email from CalMac reveals: ldquoThe guys are having great dficulty in seeing the heaving lines being thrown during the hours of darkness. The pierhead LED was swapped for sodium, we have repeatedly asked for it to be changed back, but it has never been done.Mrs Ferguson said: ldquoIn the weekly checklists submitted by CalMac between January  and December , lighting faults have been reported on  weeks out of . In other words, over that seven-year period, the pier lighting was only reported fault-free for just  weeks.ldquoPoor lighting at Craignure pier is repeatedly cited by CalMac as one of the reasons for cancellations in hours of darkness and inclement weather, yet the evidence of the weekly checklist and the email correspondence is that not only is the lighting system very poor, but repairs take a long time to be completed.Mrs Ferguson added: ldquoThe port weekly checklists from  to December  report a fender fault of one kind or another for  weeks out of , ie for only  weeks out of seven years did the weekly checklists report that there were no fender faults. Improvements seem to be completely absent. Upgrade of Craignure street lights and pier lighting to LED has been promised for several years, but has yet to materialise.ldquoThe water supply has been leaking without a permanent fix for five years.Craignure Pier is not alone in facing questions over whether it is fit for purpose. Argyll  Bute Council has long faced criticism for the state of infrastructure along a coastline that is longer than Francersquos.It has a multi-million-pound linkspan in Dunoon on the Cowal Peninsula that has no car ferry to service. Its pier at Helensburgh has lost its once regular Clyde ferries and needs pound million worth of repairs.Over the years there has been a pattern of problems, such as the specially built jetty extension at Bruichladdich that often could not handle the fuel tanker needed for Islayrsquos whisky distilleries.Islanders and coastal communities are angry, not least because piers make money. CalMacrsquos Oban-Craignure Service is its second busiest. The emails obtained under FoI, including CalMacrsquos weekly port reports, show Argyll  Bute spent only pound, on pier repairs and maintenance, over seven years while it received more than pound million in fees over the same period.Billy McClymont, chairman of Mull Community Council, speaking after the April closure, said: ldquoThe pier takes in almost pound.m a year. Itrsquos the golden goose and itrsquos a real slap in the teeth that they have spent nothing on the pier.Mr McClymont said the community council was set to join Coll, Colonsay and Tiree, in a new Confederation of Islands being planned to fight for a bigger political voice for islanders, as they claim they have been ignored for years by the council and the Scottish Government.This comes despite good news for the island. A new ferry is needed to handle a  per cent increase in the routersquos traffic as a result of the introduction of Road Equivalent Tarf in .But Craignure is not big enough for bigger ships. A recent Scottish Transport Analysis Guide appraisal stated that the north and south berths at the pier were too short for larger ferries.Meanwhile, CalMac has its own headaches, including an ageing fleet, with many past their lespans and more than  years old."},{"url":null,"title":"satnav-firms-asked-to-help-keep-left-campaign-for-tourist-drivers","story":"But now the issue of tourists driving on the wrong side of Scotlandrsquos roads has become so frequent that local politicians are seeking the help of global tech giants such as Google and Apple to remind drivers to keep left.Kate Forbes MSP, has written to the firms askingreminders can be added to their satellite navigation apps and devices telling drivers to keep left.A number of high-profile incidents involving international visitors driving on the right hand side in the Highlands have provoked calls for more to be done to educate drivers.The SNP MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch hopes notications can be included in satellite technology in a similar way to warnings to remain within the speed limit.Over half a million international travellers flock to the Scottish Highlands every year, according to VisitScotland, with many hiring cars and campervans to travel around some of the remote landmarks.Last week motorist Alan McConachie, from Elgin, was travelling home from a weekend in Glasgow when he witnessed a motorhome driving on the wrong side of the A dual carriageway.The shocking video posted online showed the motorhome hurtling down the inside lane, forcing oncoming cars out of its way.Mr McConachie said: ldquoI was behind him for miles. Just before the road becomes a dual carriageway he panicked and went across to the other side. There were people flashing him.Skye has also been prone to visiting drivers failing to keep left on their small, twisty roads. In December, local resident Sharon Anslow was on her way to work when she collided with a Fiat  being driven on the wrong side of the road by two tourists.Ms Anslow was left with minor injuries after her car plunged down a steep embankment near the Sligachan Hotel after colliding with the car.The mother-of-three, who is one of Ms Forbesrsquo constituents, subsequently launched the ldquoKeep Left campaign in an effort to raise awareness for tourists driving through the area.A petition started by Ms Anslow, to increase road signs or prompts telling drivers to keep left, has now received over , signatures. Signatories to the petition shared their similar experiences while driving on the island.Val Nash posted: ldquoI have been faced with cars and on one occasion a van, coming towards me on my side of the road.ldquoReminders are needed, especially after a parking area and heading into passing places on single-track road.While Brian McIlroy said: ldquoIrsquom a weekly commuter to the island we need to do everything we can to make driving safer on Skye. [The] #keepleft is a fantastic campaign.ldquoBetter road markings and less cluttered signage. Anything that helps visitors and locals.Following her accident, Ms Anslow said she was lucky to be alive after she was cut from the wreckage of her car by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service.ldquoThe more people I speak to the more I realise that this is a massive issue on the island and something has to be done before somebody is killed, she posted on the petition page.Speaking to BBC Scotland Ms Anslow added: ldquoItrsquos terrying. I relive the moment all the time and try to figure outI could have done anything dferently, but I couldnrsquot have done.Ms Forbes, the Minister for Public Finance and Digital Economy, has been campaigning on behalf of her constituents to increase road safety.She said she has already contacted car hire companies to raise awareness of the issue.One company, Skye Car Hire, received praise last week after including ldquoKeep Left stickers with their hire vehicles, and encouraging tourists to place them on the steering wheel.Ms Forbes said: ldquoNobody intentionally drives on the wrong side of the road, but clearly wersquove got to do more to remind visitors to drive on the left. Irsquom sure that many will be using a navigation device, whether a GPS, SatNav, Google or Apple maps.ldquoAlready, these devices usually remind drivers not to touch it whilst driving and to keep to the speed limit.ldquoAs such, I have contacted the tech companies to askthey could develop them further to remind drivers to drive on the left.ldquoThis could be done either verbally whilst driving or a warning sign before the start of a journey. Either way, it is another way of reminding drivers as they drive to keep left.The MSP has already met with Transport Scotland, VisitScotland and Highland Council officials to see what small improvements can be made before the peak tourist season."},{"url":null,"title":"why-its-time-for-an-advisory-referendum-on-independence","story":"Scotlandrsquos fate currently lies in the hands of , elderly members of the Conservative Party, who will select Britainrsquos next Prime Minister this summer without the voters of Britain having any say at all. These geriatric king-makers intend to install a leader in Nigel Faragersquos image, preferably Boris Johnson. He or she will then propel the UK into the self-inflicted turmoil of a No Deal Brexit.This is madness. Yet Scottish voters will be left watching this doomsday clock tick away inexorably till their economic welfare is sacriced on the altar of Brexit on Halloween. The prospect of No Deal may inspire a wartime spirit among Brexit voters, but the vast majority of Scottish voters see this as an act of wilful self-harm by a political elite who have lost the plot.The Scottish Governmentrsquos chief economic adviser says that No Deal could cost Scotland pound billion in less than a year. This on top of possible food and medicine shortages, and transport disruption as the UK severs its settled relations with its biggest trading partner. The longer-term impact of tarfs and lost markets could, according to the Scottish Government, cost , jobs in Scotland.Project fear  Perhaps. But not even the most starry-eyed Brexiter believes that No Deal would be cost-free. The question is: what can the Scottish government, and Holyrood, do to prevent this  Nicola Sturgeon says she wants an independence referendum in late , but by then, the damage will already have been done.I have argued against an advisory referendum on independence for the obvious reasons: Unionists would boycott it and Westminster would ignore it. But the way things are going, there may not be time to wait around for a Section  Order that never arrives. The situation is becoming critical.The Scottish Parliament needs to think carefully today about how it intends to respond to the reckless behaviour of the governing party in the UK.Gone are the visions of a smooth and orderly transition to Brexit, negotiated in goodwill with Brussels. Theresa Mayrsquos likely successors ndash Boris Johnson, Dominic Raab, Esther McVey ndash are behaving like intoxicated football fans before an away match. ldquoCome on you Brussels they slur, ldquo you think yoursquore hard enough.Even those who would prefer negotiation, like the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, are being swept way by No Deal fever. No sooner had he said that leaving without a deal would be ldquopolitical suicide than his rivals were vying with each other to don the suicide vest. They yearn for a breakdown in relations with Europe, the better to express their pugnacious nationalism.Theresa Mayrsquos EU Withdrawal Deal, which took two years to negotiate, is dead and another cannot be renegotiated before the end of the current Brextension on October . In fact, one of the conditions of the extension, we now learn, was that the Withdrawal Agreement would not be reopened. There is, as Britainrsquos first female prime minister put it, no alternative.Anyway, there wonrsquot be a Brussels to negotiate with because both the President of the Council and the President of the European Commission are standing down and their successors wonrsquot be in place until November when Britain will already have left.This means Britain is heading like an express train for a clf-edge Brexit in five short months. And, as things stand, Scotland will be dragged over the precipice along with the rest of the UK. The game plan in the Brexit Bunker is for Prime Minister Boris, or whoever, to ignore Parliament, sit tight, and allow Britain to crash out by the remorseless legal logic of Article .Many hope that Westminster will get its act together and block this ndash I certainly do. But there is no guarantee that our shell-shocked and confused MPs will be able to organise a successful no confidence motion to bring down the next prime minister and seize control. Nor is there a majority in Parliament for a repeat referendum, evenLabour were to persuade its dithering leader, Jeremy Corbyn, that it should support one. He says hersquoll think about it in September.Sothe House of Commons is now being held hostage by the Brexit revolutionaries, what can Holyrood do to save the day  Today, Nicola Sturgeon will unveil her bill for a repeat referendum, not on Europe, but on Scottish independence. However, todayrsquos bill does not actually legislate for Indyref . It merely provides the technical framework for a referendumand when Westminster agrees to make it legally binding by passing a Section  order. And the chances of that happening are precisely zero.For a start there is no prime minister to receive a Section  request. Theresa May has been reduced to the status of a piece of constitutional furniture for Donald Trumprsquos state visit. Her successor will be even less likely to contemplate breaking up the UK before the UK has departed from the EU. In fact, the prospect of any UK prime minister, Labour or Tory, agreeing to a Scottish referendum until well into the next decade seems remote.Yet, the case for a repeat referendum on Scottish independence is surely stronger than the case for the repeat Brexit referendum now advocated by Labour and the rejuvenated Liberal Democrats. Scots were told in  that only by remaining in the UK could they be sure of remaining in the EU. Now they are faced, not just with leaving Europe against their will, but crashing out of it in the worst possible terms. Material changes in circumstances donrsquot come much more material than this.Enough already. It may be necessary to advance the independence timetable and seek a test of Scottish opinion this autumn. At the very least, an advisory referendum would place on record that Scotland does not go willingly into the Brexit night."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  Do not rush to judge Theresa May or any other leader","story":"The answer, of course, might be a bit of all three, and a lot more besides.

This means workers have to collect litter by hand that has either been dropped from passing vehicles or left behind in lay-bys.Douglas Laird, Transport Scotland’s Project Manager for the AWPR B-T project explained: “The process of collecting litter from the side of a trunk road places road workers right next to high speed traffic, which can be dangerous. However, this type of work would be unnecessaryeveryone took their litter home with them. We are therefore asking road users to consider the safety of workers, not to mention the environment, before throwing litter from their vehicles.“The benefits of this project are expected to be wide-ranging, including reducing congestion, improving journey time reliability and enhancing safety, as well as attracting new business and tourists to the area. “The new trunk road gives everyone a snapshot of how beautul the north east is, so keeping it free from litter will create a good impression for visitors and give everyone the chance to see the North East at its best.”Malcolm Findlay, General Manager, Aberdeen Roads Limited commented: “We would like people to take all of their litter home with them, instead of discarding it on the new trunk road, so we don’t have to ask our road workers to clear it up. Our workers are already busy patrolling the new road to ensure it is operating as it should, as well as helping road users who need assistance.“In addition, litter-picking in certain areas of the road will require temporary traffic management to be implemented, which has an impact on road users by reducing the number of lanes available.”Inspector Steve Manson from Police Scotland said: “Littering is an offence which is thankfully unacceptable to the majority of people. However, it is becoming an issue on the new road.“Workers have to be located in close proximity to fast moving traffic to remove litter and these works can themselves be a distraction to road users. Littering on a road can also cause damage to vehicle tyres or windscreens.“In circumstances where road policing officers observe anyone to be littering on any road, they will take appropriate action.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"The Kilted Chef Craig Wilson raids Oldmeldrum local Liz Millars fridge\"  Kilted Chef sets out to reduce food waste viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"changes to come at aberdeenshire hwrcs","story":"As part of Aberdeenshire#s sht towards greater recycling rates and sending less materials to landfill, tyres and asbestos will no longer be accepted at any of the area#s Household Waste Recycling Centresfrom Monday, June .The change, which also applies to four of the council’s waste transfer stations, is expected to save around £, a year and have minimal impact on householders. The money saved will be used to employ extra staff at recycling centres, who will advise customers how best to dispose of materials, helping to increase recycling rates and reduce disposal costs. Tyres are not classed as household waste and the council has no legal responsibility to deal with them – anyone buying new tyres can pay for disposal of the old ones at the same time. Although one of the lowest tonnages of any materials handled at HWRCs, tyres are one of the most expensive to dispose of. With very limited options to recycle or reuse them, they are currently sent to a cement kiln for use as fuel, at a cost to the council. Asbestos, only currently accepted by the council at four sites under limited circumstances, is currently sent to a specialist landfill site for disposal at signicant cost. Although tyres and asbestos together only account for less than .% of the waste handled by the council each year, neither method of dealing with these materials is classed as recycling. Waste Manager, Ros Baxter, said: “We know a very small number of Aberdeenshire residents bring tyres or asbestos to the council for disposal. This service is an expensive one to provide and only benefits a few residents. “Neither of these materials contribute to the council’s recycling rate, but they do cost signicant amounts of money to deal with and take up space at the facilities where they are collected. “Requiring the person or company which generates this type of waste to ensure it is disposed of correctly at their expense not only saves the council money which is being reinvested in better services, it also frees up space for the recycling of other materials in future.“Many tyre retailers offer a disposal service for old tyres for a small fee and vehicle users should make use of this service where possible, as most people do.“There are commercial companies who will accept asbestos waste for disposal at two licensed landfill sites for a fee and anyone disposing of this material is advised to contact them.” Signs will be in place at facilities which have accepted the materials in the past advising of the change. Information on alternative disposal will also be available at HWRCs, service points and libraries. data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Some participants of this years Twilight Walk make use of a photo prop at the event\"  Twilight Walk marks th anniversary viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"While the facility to recycle these materials is being removed, the council continues to offer recycling for more than  dferent materials at HWRCs and is constantly seeking to expand this number, providing better services to Aberdeenshire residents, recycling more, protecting the environment and saving the council money on waste disposal.Clearly some people may consider disposing of their tyre or asbestos waste by illegally fly-tipping it, butyou see someone dumping waste illegally, or you come across fly-tipped materials, please contact Wasteline with as much detail as possible on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"inverurie store celebrates four years of surplus food donations","story":"Tesco#s Inverurie store is joining hundreds of others across the UK this weekend to celebrate four years of the supermarket#s surplus food donation scheme.This Saturdaycolleagues will be showcasing the Community Food Connection scheme, which is run in conjunction with leading food charity FareShare.They will be talking to customers about how the scheme works to provide free surplus food and inviting local charities and community groups who already receive food from the scheme to encourage even more to sign up.The Community Food Connection scheme ensures that every Tesco store in the UK is able to donate surplus food at the end of the day to charities and community groups.

To enter the competition, members of the public should post a portrait photo celebrating walking in some way, on Twitter or Instagram, using the hashtag #HumansOfTheWalk. Multiple entries are allowed with the competition running until Friday, May , next week. Those who take part are in with the chance of winning a Nikon B Coolpix camera.Ian Findlay, chief officer at Paths for All, said: “Orkney has a number of great walking routes — whether it’s residential streets or local paths and green spaces — and we’re keen for the community to celebrate how they make these part of their daily routines.“We want the photos to be a true reflection of everyday walking — walking that builds friendships, gives you headspace and gets you feeling fitter and out enjoying nature.“Walking can help prevent ill health, build communities and create a happier, healthier, greener Scotland and we know that people can demonstrate just that with their Humans of the Walk photos. “We want to revolutionise the way people use their cities, and stop our spaces from being dominated by cars. Scotland’s towns and cities should be a backdrop for people walking, scooting, cycling or simply spending time enjoying cleaner, quieter, calmer streets.“Paths for All is looking forward to seeing them all and wish everyone who enters the competition the best of luck.”Paths For All#s aim is to signicantly increase the number of people who choose to walk in Scotland, whether it’s walking for leisure, to work, to school or to the shops. The charity works to create more opportunities and better environments for walking, as well as cycling and other activities to help make Scotland a more active and greener place.For more information on Humans of the Walk and the competition, visit: https:www.pathsforall.org.uk humanscopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is both the highest volume of advance sales ever achieved in the voluntary-run festival’s -year tenure, as well as the greatest number of pre-festival sellouts. Stromness, the festival’s hometown in Orkney’s West Mainland, has already begun welcoming early arrivals, including some of this year’s furthest travelled visitors # Cape Breton’s globetrotting powerhouse quartet, Còig # as well as famed Irish singer Cara Dillon and Irish firebrands Four Men and a Dog, who are currently celebrating their th year on the road.Whilst early arrivals are no rarity for the festival, a far greater number than usual are already in Orkney, owing to a one-day Air Traffic Controllers’ strike across Scotland’s Highlands and Islands taking place today. As well as the closure of Kirkwall Airport, Inverness — a hub for flights from Ireland and England, before the final hop up to the islands — is also shut. With just a fortnight’s notice,  inbound arrivals originally scheduled for today, Thursday, have been rerouted, leading to early arrivals for most.Those already enjoying Orkney’s famed hospitality will soon be joined by fellow headliners including the groundbreaking Scottish three-piece, Lau a newly formed trio of celebrated Irish musicians John Doyle, Dermot Byrne and Éamonn Coyne and internationally renowned Hebridean vocalists, Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes, who visit Orkney as part ‘Between Islands’ # a collaborative project led by Stornoway’s An Lanntair, uniting musicians from Orkney, Shetland and the Outer Hebrides. Emerging artists are also prominent in this year’s festival programme, with appearances from BBC Radio Scotland’s Young Musician of the Year , Benedict Morris new Scottish six-piece Heisk and Helensburgh fiddler Ryan Young, whose accompanist, Jenn Butterworth, will work a double-sht across the next four nights, also playing with the high-spirited Glasgow group Kinnaris Quintet. In total,  acts will meet in Stromness — with the  visiting acts welcomed and outnumbered by Orkney’s thriving local folk scene, which itself features internationally renowned artists such as Saltfishforty, The Chair, The Wrigley Sisters and Gnoss, alongside local favourites including Hullion, the Kirkwall City Pipe Band # currently celebrating their centenary year # and many more. This amounts to an estimated  featured musicians # though many more will meet in Stromness, with the town’s pubs and hotels bursting with informal pub sessions from opening to closing time across the four days, alongside the ticketed programme. As well as Stromness, this year the festival reaches out to communities in Birsay, Burray, Finstown, Kirkwall, Orphir, Quoyloo, Sanday, Sandwick, St Margaret’s Hope, Stenness and Tankerness.In order to stage such a large event, the festival gratefully receives generous support from public bodies and corporate sponsors, from throughout the local and national business communities. This year’s principal supporters are Orkney Islands Council, Creative Scotland, NorthLink Ferries, Loganair — who also facilitated the rebooking of all those affected by the air traffic strike at zero cost, the Pier Arts Centre, and EIS, alongside many more inidual event sponsors and corporate patrons. The festival also benefits from many thousands of hours donated by hundreds of volunteers, who give their time freely to bring the world-renowned event together. From the twelve-strong year round management committee, to those who might work on just one event in their local community hall, each one of the festival’s community team is vital to its long standing, continued and increasing success.Festival director, Bob Gibbon said: “After many months of preparation we are delighted to be welcoming visitors and artists from far and wide, friends old and new, musicians from across the globe, to Orkney for what is set to be a memorable weekend of fun and good times. #Everyone has come together create a magnicent programme of events, and the festival just gets better and better. Orkney should rightly be very proud of what we can share, and this weekend is about sharing music, memories, time and happiness. Enjoy it everyone!”The festival’s chair, Elaine Grieve added: #I say this every year but I#m really excited about the programme for the weekend. There#s something for everyone fabulous visiting acts and a great number of local artists — and that#s something we really want to share with audiences. #It#s such a lovely time with many familiar faces ing and new joining the fold # a bit like a huge family reunion!#Alan Morrison, head of music at Creative Scotland said: “There are few places in Scotland with a more magical atmosphere than Orkney, where the stones of past civilisations sit alongside the buzz of the modern world. That’s also true of the Orkney Folk Festival, where the island’s heritage is woven into music being made by some of our best standard-bearers and rising stars. #It’s great to see so many brilliantly talented artists sharing a bill with musicians from far and near – andsome of them had to arrive a day early, well, that just means the sessions are already underway.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The final, which was held in Essex on Saturday, May , saw the finalists complete five tough physical challenges, as well as an interview with judges focusing on mental health.The competition was launched to promote mental and physical health in agriculture in a fun and engaging way.Mr Cursiter was announced as the men#s winner today, with -year-old Fiona Penfold, from the West Country, announced as the women#s winner.Asked about the importance of fitness to both mental and physical health, Sean said: #Farmers are constantly being required to produce cheap food while input costs rise. In Orkney there are a lot of farmers on their own, with  cows, living a lonely existence — they might not see another person for weeks.#He said that#s why he makes a conscious effort to socialise with others. Playing rugby for Orkney#s first team is a big part of this.#If folks close themselves in and just farm, then that#s not a good state of mind to be in. It#s hard to come away from the farm and be social, but it does have its benefits, and sometimes the lack of time is over-used as an excuse.##There are  hours in the day, so you need to give one to yourself. It#s good to have a hobby, and I don#t find that my sport has a negative effect on the farm.#For more on this story, see next week#s edition of The Orcadian.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

When attracting talent in a fast-moving and constantly evolving sector like fintech, deep and detailed knowledge of market dynamics is absolutely essential.Edinburgh-based firm Carlyle, which has signicant experience of hiring senior iniduals for both the financial services and tech sectors, is the leading search and interim specialist in Scotland’s fintech space, and the firm understands the need for “intimate market knowledge”, as managing partner Carol-Ann Searles describes it. “We have been the go-to search partner for some time for a number of large financial services institutions in Scotland and further afield,” she says.“We also have great strength in technology, working with the likes of FreeAgent, ZoneFox [bought last year by cyber security giant Fortinet] and CodeClan. We worked closely with the board at CodeClan to secure Melinda Matthews-Clarkson as their new CEO, and we are currently in the process of recruiting a CEO to succeed Polly Purvis at tech trade body ScotlandIS.” Searles continues: “Because we have real strength in tech and financial services – from start-ups to big banks – we have a unique view across both environments.“Also, having built a firm reputation in Scotland over more than a decade, our London office is now providing a very effective talent bridge.“There is real interest from our clients in London-based talent  per cent of the people we are engaging with for senior roles in Scottish-headquartered businesses are in the London area, so it’s very important for our clients that we have a presence there.”Carlyle’s presence in the UK Capital could go some way to resolving one of the conundrums faced by fintech in Scotland – how to recruit the thousands of skilled people needed by the rapidly growing sector north of the Border.Carlyle’s founding partner Duggie Carlyle thinks that part of the answer could be “fintech figureheads” – high-profile and highly-skilled people who can attract talent pools around them.“The research done by industry bodies such as Scottish Financial Enterprise says we need thousands of new people in the next ten years,” he says. “It’s a real challenge, but what we have clearly observed is that by introducing one or two highly respected leaders into a geography, other talent inevitably follows. “Ten influential people could be the catalyst to attracting thousands more, which is why we feel our responsibility as a firm is much greater than simply recruiting for senior roles.”DataFiona James-Martin, a fellow Carlyle partner, agrees. “In the data age, we can more accurately track not only the number of senior placements, but their success,” she says. “We’re beginning to collect more data which shows that precision hiring, ensuring the right person in the right role at the right time, has signicant long-term effects on our clients’ businesses.” The erse skill sets required in fast-growth businesses are increasingly being provided by experienced figures who want to work in disruptive and fast-paced environments.Carlyle explains: “There are growing numbers of senior, highly skilled executives who want to work at an impactful level, but who don’t necessarily always want to undertake a permanent role. “Many have had successful executive careers but now choose to work in shorter-term engagements. Others have four or five consultancy assignments running at the same time. “These people are providing cross-fertilisation between financial services and technology, which is really valuable. One of the results of this is that large companies are increasingly supportive of their leadership teams having outside interests.”James-Martin adds: “We’ve seen numerous positive commercial outcomes when a large business brings in talent from a smaller and more nimble company, and vice versa.”The emergence of this group of skilled iniduals with a broader industry perspective– and a desire for complex challenges – is driving growth in Carlyle’s sector-leading interim practice.In a world where, in the words of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, “The pace of change has never been so fast, yet it will never be this slow again”, the speed of hiring talent can be make-or-break for a business. However, Carlyle provides a solution via its senior interim practice, which enables the short-term placement of experienced executives. “We responded to client need by developing a senior interim offering that can bring people in very quickly on a non-permanent basis,” says James-Martin. “Fast-moving businesses simply cannot wait six to nine months to get someone into a key role and large businesses are realising the opportunity cost of not having the right person in post right now. “We can also help address this through our trademarked Parallel Search offering, which enables us to recruit an interim inidual quickly while searching for a permanent solution.”James-Martin goes on to add that this challenge can be easier to overcome for small fintech businesses: “They are more agile, with less laborious processes, and can make faster decisions and faster hires.”Cross-fertilisation between young, agile fintechs and larger, established financial services institutions is maturing and Carlyle is seeing this across its three key business areas – its core executive search practice, interim practice and board practice. Duggie Carlyle believes there is a real opportunity for smaller fintechs to attract heavyweight senior talent, in both executive and non-executive roles.He says: “What a lot of smaller firms don’t realise is that,they have a strong business, they can attract some hugely experienced names on to their board who have decades of expertise in relevant sectors. “[Smaller firms] first instinct is that such iniduals would not be interested, but often these people want to give something back and do something dferent.“We can act as a conduit for scaling companies to engage with senior people who can make a substantial impact on their business. That’s the real value inherent in our knowledge and expertise across both financial services and technology.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit could change uk politics as we know it professor john curtice","story":"Could Brexit break the mould of British politics  That is central question facing politicians after the results of the European Parliament election were unveiled on Sunday night, writes Professor John Curtice.The two parties that are meant to dominate the country’s politics – the Conservatives and Labour – between them secured less than one in fourof all votes cast. This tally has never been anything like this low since the s when Labour displaced the Liberal Party as the principal opposition to the Conservatives.Of course, in Scotland, their dominance has long been eroded away. That was more than amply confirmed in the Euro-election by the fact that the Conservatives came fourth while Labour trailed in fth place. But in England and for the most part in Wales, their grip on Commons representation has seemed secure – until now.: Scottish Labour MPs slam leadership for EU vote failure: Jeremy Corbyn handed victory to Nigel FarageIn truth, voters do not behave in European elections in the same way they would in a general election. They tend to be more willing to cast a protest vote against the incumbent vote, to vote for smaller parties, and to support credible Eurosceptic parties. Last week’s ballot provided an environment in which a mass voter defection away from the two largest parties was most likely to occur.The Conservatives and Labour would not have fared so badly in a general election. Moreover, once a Euro-election is over, any surges of support during the campaign often seem to disappear as rapidly they arose.But this does not mean we can simply dismiss what happened last Thursday.For a start, this Euro-election might well not be forgotten as quickly as its predecessors. The issue that seems to have most influenced voters in deciding how to vote – Brexit – is not going to be forgotten very quickly. : EU election results: Blackford says SNPcements case for independence voteMeanwhile, more than one of the parties that would love to end the Conservative-Labour duopoly performed well. Not only did the Brexit Party come first, but the Liberal Democrats displaced Labour from second place, while the Greens overtook the Conservatives in the battle for fourth place.This is the first occasion when the duopoly south of the border has faced a two-pronged attack. The Liberal Democrat challenge fizzled out after the party entered into coalition with the Tories in , while only then did Ukip become a serious force.The initial signs, at least, are that this rather dferent challenge to the traditional party system might yet prove a more formidable one.John Curtice is a professor of politics at Strathclyde University and a senior fellow at ScotCen Social Research©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"defiant richard leonard insists he won t resign over scottish labour s disastrous eu election result","story":"Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said he does not intend to stand down following his partys worst ever defeat in the European elections.Mr Leonard said he is \"taking the flak\" for an \"incredibly bad\" result, where the party lost its two MEPs and slid from second to fth place, with .% of the overall vote in Scotland.He played down suggestions of tumult within the senior ranks, following the resignation of his close ally, Neil Findlay, from the front bench with a call for the party to end infighting and a \"toxic\" culture of leaking and briefing.: Calls for Richard Leonard to quit after Labour slump to % in EU electionsFollowing a y group meeting in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Leonard said there had been no calls from members present for him to resign.He said: \"Im not going to resign as leader of the Labour Party.\"Weve had a constructive meeting of the group, the first chance we have had to talk about the result of the European Parliamentary election.\"There is a determination in the group to find a constructive way forward.\"We recognise that % is an incredibly bad result but we need to come together to build a way from that.\"He added: \"I am taking the flak, and I am prepared to take the flak, for what was a poor result.\"Sometimes when your backs against the wall, people come together.\"We need to rebuild the Labour vote but we will do that by being united.\"He repeated his assertion there should be a second EU referendum on a \"credible\" deal to avoid the threat of a no-deal Brexit.: Leonard ally Neil Findlay to quit Holyrood Askedhis partys Brexit position caused problems for his party, he said: \"We are trying to learn the lessons from theresult and you can draw your own conclusion from that.\"One of the Labour MEPs who lost their seat was David Martin, the UKs longest serving MEP, having spent  years in Brussels.Following the result declaration on Monday, he said the party \"lost not because of lack of effort but lack of a clear message\".He said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had become \"stuck in limbo\" on the question of the UKs EU membership.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"eu election results find out who won all of the seats for scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...With almost all the results in from Scotland, the SNP seems likely to win three of the six Scottish MEP seats, with Scottish Labour losing its two MEPs.window.twttr Results from the  councils across Scotland showed the SNP, who fought the election campaign on a strong pro-European , had polled . per cent.The partys previous best Euro election result was . per cent in .: EU Election results: Scots reject Brexit as Labour and Conservatives humiliatedMs Sturgeon tweeted: \"Formal declaration to come, but clear now that @theSNP has won the Euro election emphatically - we are on course to take  out of  seats.

They were among the first pioneers in planting English and Scots settlers in Ireland. But by , Smiths settlement failed and the lands reverted to the crown.On  May , King James I granted the Ballymena Estate to another native Irish nobleman, Ruairiacute Oacuteg MacQuillan. The estate passed through several owners, eventually passing into the possession of William Adair, a Scottish laird from Kinhilt in southwestern Scotland.The estate was temporarily renamed Kinhiltstown after Adairs lands in Scotland. The original castle of Ballymena was built in the early th century, situated to take advantage of an ancient ford at the River Braid.In  Charles I confirmed the grant of the Ballymena Estate to William Adair, giving him the right to hold a market at Ballymena on every Saturday. He hired local Irish as workers on the estate they served as tenant farmers for much of the next two centuries and more.And from those early days, Ballymena became a commercial hub for central Co. Antrim, steadily growing in prosperity through the years of the linen boom in the th century.Until recent years, the traditional market had been held at the area known as the Fair Hill on lands bordered by upper Broughshane Street, William Street and Thomas Street.When the area was sold for the development of what is now the Fair Hill Shopping Centre, the Saturday market was moved to its current venue near the Seven Towers Leisure Centre.And that is pretty much where the whole tradition kicked off nearly  years ago as the site is pretty much right in the front garden of what used to be the Adair familys residence in Ballymena!Mid and East Antrim Borough Council is urging you to come enjoy, explore and love your local market this May as part of UK wide campaign to support our local traders. ‘Love Your Local Market’ runs from - May.

Parents Charlotte and Sammy Watson, from Slatt, who lost their son Theo Philip Watson last year, want to thank all involved at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast.The Unit’s involvement allowed Charlotte and Sammy to spend precious time with Theo, who was born with Patau Syndrome, before he passed away.The Watsons are keen to give something back to the hospital.They aim to raise pound, so that the hospital can purchase a Neonatal incubator for the unit.

Farm attacks in South Africa are reported almost on a daily basis to the rest of the world and must be condemned. There is no denying they happen, the tragic results are plain to see. But what can be done about it  How does this affect how other farmers get on with le and their daily work I’ve been fortunate enough to visit and report from South Africa on five separate occasions now over the past  years and come away each time with a sense of dismissal but also hope.South Africa is a beautul country, physically, and produces some of the best food and wine demanded by consumers around the world.Politically, it’s a dferent place. A place where the state is not in charge. A state that cannot even control its basic power supply, without some form of corruption.But where does that leave agriculture and the farmers  No matter what political persuasion anyone holds, everyone must eat. Over the years of visiting farms in South Africa I noticed farmers becoming despondent, feeling let down, feeling a sense of ‘what’s the point of it all ’I’ve talked to farmers who were attacked, who lost loved ones, and who gave up.However, during my latest visit in early March this year I witnessed a positivity among farmers that really I never experienced before.Yes, nothing politically has changed, except for the worst, but farmers are more defiant, more ambitious and are investing to make their farms more efficient in order to give them a future.During the big livestock equipment show EuroTier in Germany last November I talked to a few South African farmers interested to see how technology could make their farms more efficient. It was really comforting to visit a number of farmers on this trip who are putting new technology to play in order to improve their businesses. Visiting Greenway Farms Ltd with headquarters at Tarlton to see how business partners Vito Rugani and Vincent Sequeira handle over , tonnes of carrots per year grown on , hectares was really inspiring.The passion and ambition shown by these leading vegetable farmers has resulted in a range of Rugani juices that are now being exported across the world. They have invested heavily in new state of the art equipment to extract juice from vegetables. The science is baffling, the set-up is extremely professional and as for the juice, well…..I have to admit this was the first time I ever tried carrot juice and it was absolutely delicious. The knowledge I gained from Vito and his team will stay with me for a long time. I just hope he finds a way to export the range to the UK!Next visit was to Corne Nel’s Doornfontein Melkery in Randfontein where they milk  cows. Dairy unit manager Pieter Barnard gave me a very informative tour around the farm.Having been brought up on a dairy farm myself in Northern Ireland this visit was particularly interesting and I was also impressed to see more investment in equipment to make le easier. A new rotary parlour installed two years ago certainly speeds milking time up and perhaps investment into robotic milkers will help too with the dferent milking groups in the future. The sun can be a challenge where livestock are concerned and it was good to hear plans to build new housing in the corals to keep the cows cooler. With excellent production figures and a sound understanding of the cows, this farm is certainly gearing up for an exciting future.Before travelling across the border to visit farms in Botswana I went to see Sarel Haasbroek’s grain farm in the Carletonville area of Gauteng. Again this is another progressive farmer positive about the future and was excelling in importing the Horsch machinery brand into South Africa. Up in Francistown, eastern Botswana, I was warmly hosted by the Munger family at Wayside Brahman Stud Ltd for four nights. During my stay there I was given a comprehensive run down of the breeding herd, commercial herd, game farm, and the egg laying enterprise. What a farm! Rowland and his son Rowly are certainly well respected in the area and for the cattle they produce. Wayside was started by Rowland’s father Keith who was also present during my visit. And then it was off to see another beef farmer, this time with Bonsmara cattle, Calla Visser, for a very early start checking his cattle. Every night Calla has to go and round up over  cattle on his farm and herd them into outdoor corals for the night to protect them against theft and predators such as hyenas or leopards!And, every next morning Calla and his staff start very early going around the five dferent corals on his , hectare farm counting all the cows, calves and bulls hoping they all made it through the night alive.This, of course, is a new line of management for me but was nonetheless interesting to learn. A visit to Bobbsies Chickens Ltd based in the east at Tshesebe guided by general manager Gerhard van der Merwe was another super visit. Botswana, too, impressed me, as did the farmers there. I received detailed insight into the beef and poultry industries there and look forward to the next time I can visit.Some of the Botswanans though need to learn how to drive!

They also said they hope the Scarva Street congregation will be able to move forward together.The comments came after Rev Andrew Watson was removed from his post at Scarva Street Presbyterian Church after the congregation said they no longer had any confidence in the minister.Earlier this year he was ly accused of having an “improper relationship” with another woman.Following an internal investigation, it was revealed that the accusations were unsubstantiated. However, despite having his name cleared, Rev Watson has still been removed from the post he has held for the last twelve years after the congregation committee passed a vote of no confidence.Rev Watson, who has also served as the Moderator of the Iveagh Presbytery, was removed from his position in the church last Monday, even though he was cleared of immoral conduct earlier this year.The internal investigation was launched in April when Rev Watson, who is married with five children, became the centre of malicious rumours in the town. Rev Watson was accused of having an affair with a woman who said she was going through a orce at the time. She denied there was anyone  involved in her orce.The Judicial Commission of the Presbyterian Church found “no evidence” of the alleged misconduct and it was reported that a number of the church elders had “contributed” to spreading the rumours. Two members of Scarva Street Presbyterian Church have since been disciplined for their involvement. An elder was removed from his position and the Clerk of Session was also removed from his post, although he remains as an elder in the church.Rev Watson, who moved to Scarva Street Presbyterian from Donegal in , is said to be “devastated” by the decision. The Presbyterian Church have yet to find a replacement for Scarva Street Presbyterian and it is understood that Rev Watson has not yet found a new position.A spokesperson for the Presbyterian Church said that Rev Watson was “a minister of good standing with the Presbyterian Church. I would hope Andrew will find another congregation and have a flourishing ministry. I also hope the congregation will put this behind them and move forward.”Man to stand trial over fatal stabbing Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"day two of the balmoral show in partnership with ulster bank at balmoral park outside lisburn","story":"The weather stayed kind for visitors and exhibitors at the annual show window.onload  .sharetool \"m.\" index  .indexOf \"ContentId\" pointIndex  .indexOf articleID  .substringThursday  May  :Picture DeskPictures from PressEye and Pacemaker PressPACEMAKER BELFAST  :Day two of the Balmoral Show at Balmoral Park outside Lisburn.

Over the years my da became sole owner of the butchers, it was always called A’town Meats,” he said.Gerald said his father was the eldest of five children and that Tom’s three brothers and late sister all emigrated to Canada, with his father opting to stay in Ireland to raise his young family.“At one stage he had opened up a butchers shop in Poleglass, inside a group of shops at the time and a shop in Ladybrook which my brother Vincent ran. Dad sold the business in September  and stayed on because it was coming up to Christmas, up to the Christmas club and what is a very busy time. After Christmas he stayed on, right up until around March, April time when he started to feel unwell. He was told it was cancer and started radiotherapy in October last year.”Gerald continued: “The Christmas period was very bad as he was very anxious waiting on results following the treatment. It wasn’t that he got the all clear, but he was told everything seemed ‘positive’. He knew by the end of January, early February something wasn’t right, the pain started coming back and he was told that ‘it’ was back.“A week or so later he was told that it was terminal.”“He was in hospital about a fortnight and we took him out to bring him home. He was only out three weeks and one day when he passed away.”Gerald spoke poignantly of how A’town Meats was known as a “meeting place, a place for people to come and talk”.“People would come in for a yarn, for many it was their way of getting out of the house and a chance for conversation.”Gerald said his father was a founding member of the Donegal Celtic Football Club and loved the GAA, especially local clubs Lamh Dhéarg and Rossa.“Last year was the best year of his le as he got closer to his kids. He was always working. His kids, his grandkids,you wanted to go see him you went to the shop. Eventhe children were being baptised, made their communions, their confirmations, you brought them to the shop. He was there six-days a week. I would have seen him on Christmas Day going into the shop and getting burgers, getting whatever was needed for restaurants who would’ve contacted him needing food. He went round, opened up and made sure they were catered for.”As well as a prominent businessman, Gerald said his father was a “bookmaker as well”.“He applied his trade at Celtic Park, Drumbo, Dundalk and Dunmore, it was a hobby as much as anything . He loved to see people winning.”He added: “One of the first times he ever done the book, a fella ended up owing him over £, and he said he would have it up to the shop that Tuesday. When the guy came up to the shop, my da was still meeting and greeting the customers, they came first, they were the be all and end all.“Dad gave the man a large meat parcel and said to him ‘take that down to the house with you’. The fella said it was the first time he had owed someone money, paid it and actually left ‘with a smile on his face’. The fella brought it down to his family and they were saying how nice the meat was and he replied: ‘Well of course it is, it cost me £,!’”Gerald said his father could pick up on when his customers were going through hardship.“He knew without them having to say anything. He would give them some food just to help them out, he never spoke of it, it was the people who would come in and tell you how he had helped.“A wee woman came into the shop one Christmas and she couldn’t afford the turkey so she said she was just going to take a ‘wee chicken this year’ and offered a ring as a means of payment. He wouldn’t hear of it but the wee woman insisted on giving over the ring. The wee woman passed away and her daughters came into the shop months later and he said he had something belonging to them and brought out the ring.“He was a very private man and religious in his own ways. He would’ve walked from his house in Donegall Park to Clonard, walked down for the Rosary and to St Paul’s as well. He always kept himself fit, he did Slimming World in his ’s and went out of his way to get the accreditation to sell the Slimming World endorsed food in the shop. He had people coming from all over to buy it.“He was always reading and went back to get his Degree in History. He loved the horses, he was always saying I would ‘scud’ his bets, that I was the worst ‘picker in the world’.“At the end of the day he was a very hard working, very generous, honest man. All his le he would’ve said ‘I’m doing this for you, I’m doing this for you’, in terms of working so hard at the business. He loved his family.”Gerald’s daughter and Tom’s granddaughter, Charleen Straney, described her “granda” as “a much loved man and very highly thought of by everyone who got to know him.”Tom Straney’s Requiem Mass will take place todayin St Agnes’ Church at noon."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"its second time out for the adventures","story":"ONE of the big hitters of the s pop scene, West Belfast’s very own The Adventures, will bring their back catalogue of melodic classics to County Down next weekend as part of the Harmony Live festival.Fans will be able to hear familiar singles Your Greatest Shade of Blue, Feel the Raindrops and of course ’s cracker Broken Land – the ‘most played song on Radio ’ during that particular year.In between rehearsals at Springfield Road’s Blackstaff Mill, lead singer Terry Sharpe told the Andersonstown News that the band aren’t going to be stepping away from the stage anytime soon.“We did a couple of shows at the Empire in January, all the lyrics, the cords, the tunes are hard wired into my brain. It’s like getting a record out again, all you have to do is just dust it down a bit.”Terry stressed that their Harmony Live performance, along with Irish duo Aslan and The  Of Us, definitely won’t be their last following speculation that circulated at the start of .“We didn’t say anything about final shows, I’ve actually discovered how this happened and it’s usually the venue or the agent who come out with the story. The next thing I was doing a radio interview with Johnny Hero and he was asking ‘is this going to be your last show ’ I said, ‘Johnny I don’t know, it was out of my hands’. Even when you deny it, it appears in the papers as well, but it’s not the case,” he said.Terry spoke of how nowadays outdoor festival gigs are planned to within an inch of their le – unlike back in the ’s.“Back in the day the first thing you did when you arrived at an open air thing, was the itinerary would be on the door, first thing you’d do is take it down as it had no resemblance to reality because everything then would run half an hour, to an hour late.”With the Spice Girls set to appear at Croke Park this weekend, Elton John taking two years to complete his ‘farewell’ tour and a Let’s Rock ’s festival set to set out its stall this summer in Boucher Road, Terry spoke of how nostalgia is a “new aspect” of the rock ‘n’ roll industry.“There is a big nostalgia industry, people who might have bought a record of ours when they were teenagers are now in their ’s. People want to go out and see what they spent their money on in their youths. Nostalgia is not part of the rock ‘n’ roll business, it’s a new aspect. Now rock ‘n’ roll is old enough to be nostalgic. It’s good for us, it’s good for everybody who was around at that time.”As the band fine tune their set list, Terry said that he along with songwriter Pat Gribben have been talking about making “another record”.“We’ll see,there is a demand there. We have talked about it.”A limited number of tickets for Harmony Live are still available. Tickets for the Friday May  line-up which includes Aslan, The Adventures and The  Of Us are priced at £..

The couple has moved there after the loss of the family home, Belle Reve, to creditors. Stanley’s suppressed rage at his lot in le finds an outlet when Blanche turns up.Through “nips of whiskey”, “sips of Bourbon” and card games, Blanche’s dreamy posturing and posingcollides head-on with Stanley’s rage and the anger boils over as the play reaches its brutal, violent climax.The production is spot on in its timing, debuting as the fall-out from the#MeToo campaign around the abuse of women continues to gather pace. Key contemporary issues of PTSD, mental health and gender equality are brought into sharp and devastating focus and we are forced to confront the question of how much –anything – has changed in  years.Emma Jordan’s sure-footed direction, Ciaran Bagnall’s atmospheric set and lighting design, Enda Kenny’s exquisite costume design and Carl Kennedy’s sound design interweave to bring us an utterly convincing sense of place and mood and combine with an absolutely outstanding cast to make this production the best I have ever seen at the Lyric.The audience were on their feet at the end to gave a well-deserved standing ovation to all involved in a play that will stay with you for a long time to come.A must-see.

I dont hate anybody no matter who they are or what they have done against me.\"But we have to love Christ first and what He says we have to obey his word. These things are written for our benefit.\"Baroness Paisley said she hoped the party was not making a move away from the ethos her husband established the party under.\"It was a decision taken at the time and I think it was taken as a defiance to see what would happen.\"And I think it should be put to the whole party and a proper decision made on what should be done.\"Turning to Brexit and Arlene Fosters comments on leaving the countrya united Ireland came about, Eileen Paisley said it would take an \"awful lot\" for her to move saying so long as their was freedom of religion she would remain.\"I would not like a dictatorship or someone whatever their religion was to be persecuted because of that.\"It is a big question. If we go right back to the beginning, the iding of Ireland.

It is too big an issue for me to ponticate on.\" I dont want my mind and soul to be poisoned with an unforgiving spirit.Baroness Paisley said she missed her late husband more, and more every day and she was told many times by others across the political ide and the communities his leadership was missed.She recalled how her husband wanted to be a farmer when he was a young boy and it was when sowing corn he heard the call from God that it was not he seed He wanted Ian to sow.She said in his first sermon in Sixmilecross in Co Tyrone he spoke for only  minutes before running out of material and immediately vowed to never speak again.\"And the man that was taking him told him youll speak all right, and so his words were fulfilled,\" she said.In his final years the Free Presbyterian Church ostracised its founder.

These are heady days for Naomi Longs Alliance Party..pushThe implications are potentially profound, for Brexit and a border poll. Most Northern Ireland voters voted Remain in , have backed Remain parties since, elected two Remain candidates at this election and support the backstopthey cannot stay in the EU. So good luck to the next Conservative leader explaining to Brussels why it is in Northern Irelands best interests that a Withdrawal Agreement signed off across all member states be renegotiated. Barnier will bin Boris, not the backstop. Then the Conservative government may have the stark choice between a plea for another delay to departure - which party leadership candidates are ruling out - or leave the EU with no deal. And the DUP will inhibit any backsliding from a new Conservative leader who, like the outgoing one, concedes that there really is no alternative to the backstop.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetAlliance surge Phase  wont sht the DUP. Its vote share rose again, with Diane Dodds cantering home. Meanwhile, the UUP is now bereft of representation everywhere except on local councils. Given that most Northern Ireland voters want to remain in the EU, the logic of the UUP in switching sides to supporting leave was questionable. This was another very weak election performance. The unionist leave-the-EU market was already a crowded marketplace in which it made little sense to jostle with the DUP and TUV bruisers. Having cautioned in  against Brexit on the grounds of economic damage, the UUP now advocated its implementation on the basis of popular UK sovereignty - which is not the easiest canvass. A personable candidate like Danny Kennedy was always up against it taking on the committed Brexit true believers. Does this result hasten a possible referendum beyond Brexit - a border poll  In this European contest, % of voters backed unionist parties, % backed nationalist organisations and % backed others. Thats nowhere near dramatic enough for the Secretary of State to fire the starting pistol, but it does indicate that a border poll,ever called, is not quite a foregone conclusion for the unionist cause. To be safe, unionists would have to attract the backing of at least one-third of those supporting Alliance or the Greens - and many of those supporters are utterly alienated by Brexit and its backers. Otherwise, unionists might need Seamus Mallon to do the counting. Alliances success also brings into question the political structures which have so prioritised unionism and nationalism within the Assembly. Parallel consent rules framed around those two minority identities - when the largest category of people, albeit not among those bothering to vote, say they are neither, may need revisiting. Northern Irelands party system is changing, with single big parties dominating the right, left and, finally, the centre. Brexit continues to transform politics - and we are far from done yet.

Its EU campaign unfortunately summed up the party - lacklustre and with no clear message.It is almost impossible to see the UUP becoming competitive again. It has oftencomplained that elections here are just sectarian headcounts which favour the two big beasts. Yet this months council and EU polls were far less that than any others in recent decades, and the UUP still lost signicant ground.Robin Swann cant be blamed for the problems his party is facing because he inherited them. The UUP shied away from taking bold decisions about its political direction in , preferring just to stick with the old familiar, failing approach.But it seems apparent that Mr Swann has no clear road map for the way ahead. Indeed, one likely doesnt exist. Traditional unionists will continue to stick with the DUP, liberal ones wont be leaving Alliance now. Despite two poor elections, he is unlikely to be challenged for the leadership because nobody in their right mind would want it.It was a good election for the DUP. Diane Dodds reduced Sinn Feins lead from , to , votes and was elected two counts ahead of Martina Anderson. Mrs Dodds has never had the spectacular victories that her predecessors, Rev Ian Paisley and Jim Allister, enjoyed. Yet she still increased the vote and her party will be well pleased with the result.The sharpest minds in the DUP realise that the biggest threat to it in future isnt from a disorganised, dwindling UUP, but from a youthful, energetic, hard-working and well organised Alliance Party.They realise that unionists, especially young ones, do increasingly vote Alliance and that constantly bashing the party as crypto Provos just wont wash.Expect those in the DUP who favour a more secular and liberal approach to make their voices heard internally over the next few months.Coming in comfortably ahead of the UUP was a very good result for Mr Allister who may have initially regretted running for Europe after the TUVs council results. He clearly still has a real future in politics here, although his party is destined to remain largely a one-man band.It wasnt a bad election for Colum Eastwood who managed to finally halt the SDLPs terminal decline and actually increased its vote, albeit by .%.Yet disappointment was written all over its leaders faces yesterday. They genuinely expected to be in the running for the last seat and will be concerned at Alliance overtaking them to emerge as the third largest party in the poll. By common agreement across the political spectrum, Mr Eastwood ran the best campaign of all the candidates. Yet the message from the result has to be that, unlike Mrs Long, his personal appeal is not greater than his partys.Martina Anderson may have topped the poll but dont be fooled into thinking it was a good day here for Sinn Fein whose vote was down %. The party is losing votes to Alliance and the Greensin middle-class areas while under pressure from People Before Profit and independent republicans in working-class areas. It will now be keener to restore devolution.In the Republic, Sinn Feins council vote decreased by a third to just under % and its likely to lose an MEP. The shine is rapidly coming off Mary Lou McDonalds leadership and expect Gerry Adams to start popping up more in an effort to reassure the base. Further reversals in a Dail election would put the Sinn Fein president on very dodgy territory indeed."},{"url":null,"title":"day of waiting at midlands north west as no second seat announced","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Where the liquid had hit, the mother reported her daughters skin was gone and blisters were forming in other areas and the child was crying.Upon landing in Krakow the girl was airlted to hospital and was then transferred to Toronto, Canada where she spent eight days being treated as an outpatient for her burns before ing home to Calornia.Sriya Venkata Neti, who is now  years old, and lives in Freemont, Calornia had through her father Srinivas Neti sued Ryanair over the accident on the Rome Krakow flight on June , .She had claimed she had been served a hot chocolate at such a high temperatures that the liquid could and did cause severe scalding and burns to her and there was an alleged failure to provide a safe method of service of hot beverages in particular hot chocolate suitable for minors.It was further claimed there was an alleged failure to warn the little girl of the known danger posed by the temperatures at the which the chocolate was served.It was also alleged there was an alleged failure to provide any or any adequate assistance to the child and her family post spillage and that after a time it was allegedly requested the little girl be moved to a toilet for treatment so as not to disturb other passengers.The alleged failure of the cabin crew it was claimed to prove any adequate assistance to the girl or her parents allegedly resulted in the burns suffered being exacerbated.In particular, it was claimed the alleged failure to provide any or any adequate means of cooling the burns worsened the injuries considerably.Ryanair denied all the claims.The girls counsel Hugh Mohan SC told the court it was a slightly unusual case in that  under the Warsaw Conventiona passenger on an international flight can show that bodily injuries were caused by an accident, an unexpected or unusual event that is external to the passenger, then the passenger need not show negligence or fault as against the airline.The young girl suffered burns to her thighs and buttocks and has been left with scarring, the court heard.In an affidavit to the court, the girls father Srinivas Neti said the scarring has now substantially improved and whereas the injuries sustained were extremely serious, his daughter has made a good recovery and the condition of her injuries has improved considerably.Approving the settlement Mr Justice Kevin Cross said when Sriya was scalded it must have been extremely painful. The young girl has also been left with scarring but the court heard she has made a good recovery. He also took in to account that the family now wanted to get on with their lives and to put the incident behind them."},{"url":null,"title":"wallace overtakes kelleher as ireland south count continues into fourth day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsEU Elections Top  CompaniesNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Hotels currently have a wage content of around % of turnover.\"The sector has a iety of roles from entry level at the appropriate national minimum wage level of the candidate through to supervisory, management and executive roles.\"The Federation has not seen the evidence that the LPC received last week and therefore is not in a position to answer the specics. Nor have the NIHF been made aware of working conditions contra to current national minimum wage levels by any trade union official or employee in the Derry-Londonderry area.\"Ms Gault added: \"Allegations of this nature are very damaging and without having specic examples are impossible to abate.\"As an industry we have done much to improve our image: improving working hours, providing strong and well rewarded career paths and supporting qualications that give employees the opportunity to have greater skills to work globally.\"googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Niall McCarroll, chairman of the Derry Trades Union Council, and members of Aegis in meeting with the Low Pay Commission."},{"url":null,"title":"foyle hospice weekly draw results winner","story":"Winners in this weeks Foyle Hospice Weekly Draw are - st prize: £,, Paul Breslinnd prize: £,, Rollover : rd prize: £, Terry Monaghanth prize: £, Diarmuid Campbellth prize: £, William Linton .googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"draft wales rally gb 2019 route","story":"Lights, cameras, action ndash the Wales Rally GB ceremonial start will be stagltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgted in Liverpool for ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtthe first timelt spangtlt spangtlt spangt\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedHuge crowds are expected at this year#s Wales Rally GB\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedA new street stage in Colwyn Bay is on the  schedule\" Major innovations add to Wales Rally GB as  draft route is releasedLocal hero Elfyn Evans makes a splash on Wales Rally GB.

Some say while those carrying out the work are obliging, they are not responsible the delay or the lack of communication.Businesses are also hoping that customers they have not seen for some time willwhen Irish Street s to a sense of normality.They say the loss of parking spaces has impacted on trade with the work forcing people not to use one of the townrsquos main car parks nearby.During last weekrsquos protest, one trader revealed that her business has been forced to go mobile, visiting the homes of elderly people who cannot safely access her premises in the town centre due to the public realm scheme.Restaurant owner Mizba Uddin says things have been ldquoterrible for his business since work on the project began.ldquoThe business has literally collapsed, he declared, standing outside his restaurant surrounded by barriers used by contractors.ldquoThe situation is very, very bad and we have even have people driving down the one-way system the wrong way. Parking spaces have been lost as a result of the work and not all will be ed when the scheme is completed. People are going where as we do not provide a delivery service.Mizba said one of his main concerns has been the lack of communication from those overseeing the project. He also urged those in charge of the scheme to talk to traders to let them know what is going on.He added: ldquoI was told that the scheme would end in March and have heard nothing since. I am relying on other people to tell me what is going on but it should not be like this. I cannot even clean my windows because there is so much dust everywhere.ldquoSummer time can be quiet for me. Everyone in Irish Street wants this project completed as quickly as possible. As the work continues, there are simply no customers going to any of the shops. The work is killing businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Ballygalget woman’s two week walk meeting inspirational people  ","story":"A BALLYGALGET woman is one of two volunteers who are spending a fortnight walking in towns and villages around Northern Ireland meeting inspirational people who are improving their communities.Patricia Fleming, a former camogie player with Ballygalget John Mitchelrsquos GAC, called into her old club last Sunday accompanied by Rory Mullan from Derry.They were hand-picked from a raft of candidates to be Big Lunch walkers for this year.Starting last Friday, they are visiting dferent places in Northern Ireland ahead of the Big Lunch weekend on June -.The Big Lunch event is where over six million people through the UK will meet to share food and eat together.Patricia and Rory visited Ballygalget to hear about all the great work the club does in the surrounding area.Patricia, who now lives in Belfast with her family, told the club how its community work was inspiring.ldquoThe reason I picked Ballygalget is that Irsquom from here, Irsquove played on that pitch many times, but I also know the community spirit that exists within Ballygalget. It blows me away when I come home and hear all the things that are happening.ldquoWhen I went for my interview after applying to be one of the Big Lunch walkers, I said thatI was chosen I would like to bring the Big Lunch community walk into rural areas and to Ballygalget.ldquoPeople here are very community oriented. That is not the case everywhere. A lot of people donrsquot feel able to knock on their neighboursrsquo doors.The club hosted a Big Breakfast fundraiser on Sunday towards sending the clubrsquos U- boys and girls to next monthrsquos Feile in Cork.However, the club is also trying to gather support for a huge number of projects, including cross-community work and is also going to host its own event over the Big Lunch weekend.A new cross-community gym opened in the club grounds a year ago, which has proven immensely popular with all sorts of people in the local area, including many who had no links with the GAC.The new building also has space for social workshops and some of the wider community schemes the club wants to pursue.Last year, Ballygalget won an Alzheimerrsquos Society Diversity Award for its work in the community.Club member Roisin Coulter said: ldquoWe are working to become a dementia-friendly community. The idea is to educate people about dementia: what are the signs and symptoms, and how to support someone living with the condition.ldquoEvery month we run a free two-hour workshop, with materials supplied by the Alzheimerrsquos Society.ldquoOur club is very much affected by dementia. Quite a number of people in the club are living with a diagnosis within their families. We want to reduce stigma and the social isolation people can feel.Aoe Savage, Ballygalget GACrsquos Health Club Officer, added: ldquoWe are working against social isolation within our area.ldquoWe are trying to improve health and wellbeing ndash both physical and mental health ndash of people who live nearby, on a cross-community basis.Ballygalget was the walkersrsquo third stop on their tour around Northern Ireland. They have already visited Belfast and Balmoral Show.Over the next two weeks will visit other places including Lisnaskea, Portadown, Ballymoney and Derry.There is still plenty of time to sign up at www.edenprojectcommunities thebiglunchhomepage..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Businessman calls for work to be completed quickly  ","story":"IRISH Street businessman Darren Trainor said the public realm scheme needs to be completed quickly for the benefit of everyone in the town.He saidthose in charge of the scheme told traders that they planned to deploy more men to finish it earlier they would put up with the disruption for a just a little longer.And asking for businesses to be provided with up-to-date information, Mr Trainor appealed to those in charge ldquocome and talk to us.He continued: ldquoWe received a letter informing us that the work would be completed on March . We are all so frustrated that this scheme has taken so long and we have lost regular customers which over a month or two would be fair enough, but over six or seven, you are not going to get them back.ldquoWe have been in business for over  years andit was not for that we probably would have closed by now. The first plan I viewed showed two parking spaces outside my door but they have been taken away.Businessman Francie Young, who is also upset about the y delay, also questioned the design of the scheme, pointing to a wide footpath at the top of Irish Street, close to the John Street junction.ldquoThe road will be considerably narrower at this point and can anyone tell me the reason for this  he asked, while Maurice Massey was critical of the lack of communication with Irish Street business owners, particularly in relation to the delay in completing the work.He said the business community should have been much better informed, with greater account taken of the impact the delayed scheme was having on trade.Alan Oakes said ldquocustomers have gone with businesses unsurethey will . He also appealed for better lines of communication between traders and those in charge of the scheme.It has also been confirmed that the work in Irish Street is impacting on patients attending a dental surgery, with those most affected the elderly and those with mobility problems.Traders say they are simply asking for communication and to be told what is happening, with the major concern that a project scheduled to last a few months had now entered its fth month, with work on only one side of the street largely completed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity concert  in Seaforde  ","story":"A CONCERT takes place in Seaforde tomorrow night in aid of a Parkinsonrsquos charity.The locally-based Harmonic Progression womenrsquos community choir will be presenting their spring concert, entitled Makers of Music and Dreamers of Dreams, in Seaforde YFC Hall at .pm.Rehearsals are well underway for the concert which is inspired by the first line of Arthur OrsquoShaughnessyrsquos Ode.One of the choir members, Heather Knipe, and her husband, John, are climbing Mount Fuji in Japan for the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust and all donations at the door and from a raffle will be presented to this charity during the concert.Harmonic Progression.

The video was well received and no doubt there will be more versions in the future.Bruce Grobbelaar then rose, to a rapturous reception to deliver one of the slickest and wittiest after dinner speeches the club has heard.Stories from his early days as a  year old lsquokeeper with Highlanders FC, a Zimbabwean football club based in Bulawayo, to an eventual move to Vancouver Whitecaps and subsequent transfer to Crewe Alexandria until the legendary Bob Paisley signed him for Liverpool in .Grobbelaar played  times for the Reds in a trophy-laden career. Among the stories he told were e the events of May , , when his antics in a penalty shoot out against Roma helped Liverpool to win the European Cup.He also talked about his career after Liverpool and working with Alan Ball at Southampton at the height of the match fixing allegations that were made against him.When Ball was asked by the media why he was playing Grobbelaar in goal ahead of England international Dave Beasant, Ball reputedly said: ldquoI would rather have Bruce in goal trying to throw the game than Dave doing his best to save it.By common consensus, Bruce was one of the best speakers the club has had and has whetted the appetite for the future to renew the clubrsquos tradition of bringing over guest speakers.Bruce was presented with a small gt from the club by youth team coach Simon Thornton, a set of golf balls and towel from the Royal County Down Golf Club.Club secretary Andy Hall then spoke for a few minutes to highlight some of the highs and lows of the last  years and to thank IFA regional development officer Seamus Heath for all the work he does in promoting football across the Newry Mourne and Down Council area.Andy then invited IFA vice-chairman Jack Grundie to say a few words with Jack presenting the club with a gt to mark the occasion.County Antrim FA president Jim Jess also spoke warmly about the club and presented a memento to mark the occasion with Maurice Johnston, vice chair of the Mid Ulster Football League, congratulating the club on their th anniversary and presenting Tollymore chairman John McIlvenny with a gt to recognise the achievement.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig was unfortunately taken ill before the dinner and was unable to attend and the club sends its warm wishes to him for a speedy recovery.The final official speaker was Elaine Junk, the former chair of the NI Womenrsquos Football Association during the period when Tollymore had a successful ladiesrsquo side.Elaine congratulated the club on its th anniversary and encouraged them to get a ladiesrsquo team back up and playing.With the official proceedings drawing to a close there was one last surprise with Adrian Howard presenting a le time achievement award on behalf of players and members to Andy Hall in recognition of all his work for the club.It was a wonderful gesture by the club and much appreciated by Andy.The evening concluded with dancing to the wonderful Fth Avenue with Bruce continuing to sign autographs and pose for pictures into the wee small hours..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Locals flying high in F15 championship  ","story":"ROGER Chamberlain and Charlie Horder won the Northern Ireland Flying Fteen Championship on Strangford Lough at the weekend.It was a deserved triumph for the Whiterock duo and also for Strangford Sailing Club, which hosted the event less than a month after the re-opening of its clubhouse which was gutted by an accidental fire in September .The five-race championship attracted a -strong fleet, which included a sizeable contingent of southern visitors, mainly from Dun Laoghaire.After three races on Saturday Chamberlain and Horder were in third place, behind Killyleagh pair Andrew McCleery and Colin Dougan mdash who got off to a flyer by winning the opening race mdash and overnight leaders Brian McKee and John Gibson, also from Whiterock, who were second and seventh in the first two races before winning the final race of the day.Chamberlain and Horder came out of the blocks early on Sunday and comfortably won the fourth race before sealing the championship with fth place in the final race.McKee and Gibson were a disappointing th in the fourth race, but with the discard brought into play, they still had a chance of outright victory.

beyond his power’ in Loughinisland report  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos Police Ombudsman went beyond his legal powers in publishing a report ldquoreplete with determinations that RUC officers colluded with loyalists in the Loughinisland massacre, the Court of Appeal heard last week.Lawyers for two retired senior policemen claimed the watchdogrsquos damning findings on the Loughinisland atrocity should only have been releasedit had recommended prosecutions or disciplinary action against any of those under scrutiny.Judgment was reserved in the renewed bid by Raymond White and Ronald Hawthorne to have the report quashed.UVF gunmen opened fire at the Heights Bar in Loughinisland, Co Down as their victims watched a World Cup football match in June .The men killed were: Adrian Rogan , Malcolm Jenkinson , Barney Green , Daniel McCreanor , Patrick OrsquoHareand Eamon Byrne .Five others were also wounded in a sectarian attack for which no-one has been brought to justice.In June  the Ombudsman, Dr Michael Maguire, said collusion between some officers and the loyalists was a signicant feature in the murders.He found no evidence police had prior knowledge, but identied ldquocatastrophic failings in the investigation.Mr White, representing the Northern Ireland Retired Police Officersrsquo Association, and Mr Hawthorne, a former sub-isional police commander, have been involved in a long-running legal challenge to the published findings.A first hearing resulted in a ruling in  that the report was procedurally unfair and had failed to make clear it conclusions did not apply to Mr Hawthorne.At that time the watchdog agreed to remove any references to him to ensure he is not connected to any alleged wrongdoing mdash a move seen as complete vindication for the former police commander.A limited re-hearing before a dferent judge focused only on issues around the extent of the powers to publish the findings.In November last year a High Court judge rejected the retired officersrsquo case that Dr Maguire had exceeded his legal remit.Mr White and Mr Hawthorne are now now appealing that ruling.The former policemenrsquos barrister, David McMillen QC, stressed their complete support for the Ombudsmanrsquos role in scrutinising and holding officers to account.He argued, however, that the watchdog lacked the legislative authority to publish such ldquoconclusive findings in the Loughinisland report.ldquoHe simply does not have that power, Mr McMillen said.ldquoThis is an organ of the state, an important and very public organ of the state finding police officers guilty.Askedhe believed the Ombudsmanrsquos report had concluded police officers may have committed criminal offences, Mr McQuillen replied: ldquoIt was replete with those suggestions.But Mr McMillen rejected suggestions that the document could be amended to state there ldquomay be evidence of criminal or disciplinary offences.ldquoThe report is so infected with conclusive language all the way through, about what he found, that a simple rider would not make sense, he said.Barra McGrory QC, for the Ombudsman, countered that the legislation allowed him to express an opinion on the alleged collusion.He said: ldquoThe definition the Ombudsman has set out on collusion is broad enough to encompass behaviour and actions by police officers which cannot be identied as specic criminal offences which could be referredunder that part of the scheme.Following submissions Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan, sitting with Lord Justices Stephens and Deeny,

compared to % of those in council areas that did not.Re-Gen Waste Ltd managing director, Joseph Doherty, said the survey results indicated that prioritising simplicity and convenience was the best approach to ensuring a high level of household recycling.He continued: ldquoSince April , glass can now be commingled with household recycling waste in the Down legacy council area, meaning that all householders across Newry, Mourne and Down can now put their glass into their blue bins.ldquoWe should see an marked improvement in recycling figures and a decrease in the percentage of glass placed in black bins across the entire council area.Mr Doherty said local authorities need to encourage the maximum number of people to recycle the maximum volume of materials, weighed against the cost of processing the material, and the potential financial benefits from reducing landfill costs, and selling on recyclable material.ldquoThe councils we with work in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland tell us that household friendly schemes such as commingling recyclables, plastic, paper, card, tins and cardboard and glass in one bin, are much preferable to residents than any pre-sort scheme using

the man tasked with the job of overhauling the countryrsquos ldquoided schools.At an Ulster University event in Belfast last week focusing on sectarianism, the Dundrum man said the segregated education issue needed to be addressed.He also criticised what he described as the ldquocasual sectarianism and ldquotribalism which characterises parts of society.He continued: ldquoI think we really have to address education, segregated education and I think that as a society we kind of have to start calling out that casual sectarianism.ldquoWhenever we had peace here we thoughtwe move on to a Glaswegian level of sectarianism that is fine, so we only hate each other every week when we go to football. That is not good enough. The tribalism of that is not good enough.The comedian also suggested that the integrated education term was ldquoinsulting.He explained: ldquoAround the rest of the world that is called education. What we have in this country is segregated education.The Dundrum man also paid tribute to the ldquobrilliant work of teachers but said people felt those high standards were enough and did not tackle the underlying ision.ldquoThe natural  of mixing and realising that we are exactly the same and having a school that has got a rugby team and a GAA team, you donrsquot have to go to that schoolyou like GAA. There are just certain things that we really need to have a look at and I am not sure that we are necessarily ready for it.Speaking at the Belfast event, Mr Kielty argued that changing the education system would have to be done by an international figure like former US senator George Mitchell.ldquoOnce we actually get through it we will go, lsquogee why didnrsquot we do that before now rsquo, but it is a dficult one, he conceded, suggesting that social media is contributing to the lack of exposure to dferent views.ldquoYour own opinion is folded back into yourself on the screen every day, he said. ldquoMore than ever, we actually have to put the screen down and make an effort to realise that we are the same.ldquoWe talk too much about dference here. You are either a British person living on the island of Ireland or you are an Irish person who is currently actually in the UK. You are actually a bit of both.Mr Kielty added: ldquoThe minute that we accept that that is going to move in a fluid way, and it is perfectly fine to be a bit of both, that is kind of where we need to be.Meanwhile, the charity which has been working for almost three decades to bridge the gap between starting integrated schools and securing full government support has welcomed Ulster University proposals for a concerted effort in Northern Ireland to eradicate sectarianism.The university, supported by the Sir George Quigley Fund, launched lsquoSectarianism in Northern Ireland: a Reviewrsquo at a conference at the UUrsquos Belfast campus last week.The Integrated Education Fundmdash which was established in  mdash praised the conference for addressing the issue and welcomed Patrick Kieltyrsquos comments that educating all children together is the way forward for a shared future.The review contains more than  proposals for how bodies including government, business, education, youth services, arts and sport could work collectively over a sustained period of time to foster greater collaboration and understanding across communities.As well suggesting that a government department should be established specically to tackle sectarianism, the researchers propose establishing a new civic body to help shape community efforts toward reconciliation.IEF chief executive Tina Merron said the organisation ldquoshares the vision, held by the overwhelming majority of citizens, of a united community and a shared future.Ms Merron said that at the signing of the Good Friday Agreement there were , pupils in  integrated schools, compared with more than , attending  integrated schools today.She said that with no government plan for integrated education, the growth was down to ldquodetermined campaigners and pioneering parents.She added: ldquoWe see a reformed education system as an essential ingredient of this future an education system which brings children, staff and governors from Catholic and Protestant traditions, as well as those of other faiths or none and of other cultures, together in schools, an education system which recognises and respects ersity and ensures that all young people feel confident and welcome in their school environment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Sinn Fein’s Casey chosen as district’s first citizen  ","story":"SINN Feinrsquos Charlie Casey is Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos new chairman.The Newry politicianrsquos appointment was confirmed at the local authorityrsquos annual meeting on Monday night when he succeeded the SDLPrsquos Mark Murnin as the districtrsquos first citizen.The new council vice-chairman is Rowallane SDLP councillor Terry Andrews, who succeeded Sinn Feinrsquos Oksana McMahon, who represented the Crotlieve area but lost her seat in the recent local government election.The new chairman was presented with his chain of office by his predecessor, who also losthis Slieve Croob seat at the recent election.The new first citizen said he was delighted to be nominated for the position by his party and hoped to do the position justice, urging all councillors to unite to protect services under the threat in the council area, particularly those in relation to the health and welfare of all, in particular, the most vulnerable.Cllr Casey also took time to thank Mr Murnin and Mrs McMahon for their work over the past year and the other councillors who were not ing to the council following the election.Addressing members as chairman for the first time, Cllr Casey urged them to fight for lesaving and le-changing services, champion the cause of equality and take forward the councilrsquos commitment of putting the organisation at the heart of everything it does.ldquoNewry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos mission is to lead and serve the district as a prosperous and healthy area and ensure it is sustainable from an economic, environmental and social perspective.

His heart is working at only % capacity and last week his consultant confirmed to his parents that he was on the organ donation list.There are around  children currently waiting on a heart in the UK.The Grants do not know how long Ollie will have to wait until a suitable one becomes available for him.Like many other parents, the couple were not aware that children could be registered for organ donation.They spoke to BBC Northern Ireland to urge more parents to register their children, although it was not a situation they would wish on any other parent.ldquoItrsquos a hard thing to think about. If you think about it from another aspect mdash of you being the person that had the child that needed the heart mdash you would be wanting people to consider it, said Damien.His we, Riona, said: ldquoWe didnrsquot think that this would happen to us and nobody thinks itrsquos going to happen to them. If a child is to get sick, or an adult mdash it doesnrsquot matter who mdasha heart or a liver or kidney, or whatever the case may be, is their only option, then what would they do Damien said Ollie was currently holding his own, but that doctors were still concerned.ldquoWith Ollie it is very dficult to tellhe is doing well or not, he is still smiling and laughing away, but doctors are concerned that his saturations have been up and down this week and he has been vomiting, Damien told the Recorder.ldquoThis is likely due to the heart failure because so far all other tests have been negative for any viruses.ldquoHowever, itrsquos great to know our message is being heard, raising awareness of the lack of organs available and getting families to bring up the conversation in the house.ldquoReading through some of the online comments to the recent media coverage, it gives us great comfort knowing that so many people have signed up because of Olliersquos story and it will hopefully go on to save so many lives.One woman posted on Facebook after seeing the Grantsrsquo appeal: ldquoSo proud of my  year-old daughter and  year-old son who saw this story, had a long meaningful conversation with their dad this evening and just both signed up on the NI organ donation register.

Outside court the man’s lawyer, Eoin Murphy of O’Muirigh Solicitors, said: “The signicance of parliamentary boundaries for representationat the highest level of our democracy is obvious.“Once the recommendations are adopted, they will be dficultnot impossible to change for at least the next election, which may affect how inidual constituents are represented for several years.”Mr Murphy stressed that the case was his client’s only option for challenging the proposals.“Given the very signicant effects of any legal error on the part of the Commission, and the essentially irreparable nature of those errors, the court quite correctly exercised an intense level of scrutiny and arrived at the correct conclusion that the Commission had fallen into legal error and acted in a procedurally unfair way.” try catch  TrendingN.I. motorist crashes car with R plates through clothes shop windowN.I. set to sizzle in long summer of intense heat -

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Especially being Cameroonian, living in a culture that isnrsquot mine, and with my kids growing up between two heritages.ldquoI didnrsquot want them looking down on one half of their heritage. I wanted to pay them a fuller narrative.No major publishers have picked up the books yet. ldquoI was disheartened early on in the process. One publisher advertised themselves as being very inclusive.ldquoI reached out to them but was disappointed by their feedback ndash all they said was a childrenrsquos book is  pages long. It felt like you can only be a BME authoryou conform to these standards. Really,yoursquore trying to promote ersity in publishing you should look outside the box!The books use the personal experiences of the boys as inspiration. ldquoTwo years ago we travelled around Europe. We found a caravan and went exploring, and the books have been inspired by our adventures ndash the first being Charlie the Fearless and Tancho the Brave.ldquoTheyrsquore all about courage, and being brave enough to admit when something scares you. They focus on looking out for one other, and how love makes you brave.ldquoA Place to Call Home deals with the anxiety of moving, and the unknown, as we travelled and settled in Penarth.ldquoTheyrsquore about making the best of situations ndash there are little anecdotes in every story, like the time we broke down in north France.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/sto1.jpg","title":"ni business rates to undergo full review","story":"Posted on Thursday May  by John Mulgrew There will be a full review of Northern Ireland’s business rates system, a top civil servant has revealed. Sue Gray, Permanent Secretary of the Department of Finance, announced the full review into the taxation system for companies here, during a Local Government conference, with Retail NI and law firm DWF, at Titanic Belfast. The reform and re-examination of business rates has been one of the core concerns among the retail and hospitality sectors for the last few years. It’s one of several key business issues which had been kicked down the road due to the ongoing impasse at Stormont. The news has been welcomed by Retail NI and Hospitality Ulster. In a joint statement, the groups said: “Both our organisations are delighted that the Department of Finance have announced this review into non-domestic rates. We have consistently lobbied for this over a number of years and are pleased that our joint call has been heard” “While this is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end. This review provides us with a roadmap for radical change to an antiquated and not fit for purpose system of business rates which is a major burden for our members “In this review we will be outlining signicant changes to rates, including our proposals for a targeted approach to small business rates relief, a revamp of the rates hardship fund, green rates rebate for business who invest in carbon neutral technology and greater relief for new start businesses. “At the last UK Budget, the Chancellor gave independent retailers and hospitality businesses a third off their rate bills in England. We want nothing less than this for our members in Northern Ireland.\" Ms Gray says that \"in recent years signicant changes have taken place in our high streets and town centres. It is critical from a business perspective, as well as a government funding perspective, that our rating system is capable of responding to this wider process of change. That’s why today I am announcing a full and comprehensive review of business rates. “We must create a rating system which generates the funding our public services need while supporting businesses in all sector and enabling economic growth right across Northern Ireland. “In an environment where we are working without ministers, there are limitations to what we can do by way of policy change. But we need to be ready with updated advice for incoming ministers for theirto office. This fundamental review is therefore a critical part of this process.” And Aodhán Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said: “We wholeheartedly welcome the announcement of this review and it is a credit  the Permanent Secretary’s drive to make positive change. “The fact that retail is % of the economy and pays a quarter of all business rates is simply not sustainable especially give the seismic structural changes going on in the industry. “We have some of the highest business rates in Europe and they are a disincentive to investing in Northern Ireland. We are already playing catch up to the rest of the UK on business rates reform where our businesses pay p in the pound more than the UK average. “This review must look at all aspects of the system. There must be equity in any new system that allows for a widening of the tax base and an audit of the plethora of exemptions some of which have been in place since the s. “If we don’t get business rates right, we risk further shop closures which will  not only cost jobs  but leave a gaping hole in NI finances.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"could a new dawn boost ni business development","story":"Posted on Friday  May  by Ulster Business While Brexit is still upon us, John Simpson says the business sectors finances have proved stronger than predicted and lending could be boosted on the outside as the veil of uncertainty lts The darkest hour comes just before the dawn: an apt reference to the prospects when Brexit is finally taken out of the daily diet of news, concern about business disruption, and foreboding about dficult trading prospects. Brexit is proving to be a slow departure. This year the economy has proved more resilient than many feared. Employment has remained at high levels, jobs for skilled employees are available, and with less certainty personal incomes have been maintained.Political uncertainty and efficient business management are an uneasy mix. In the recent winter and springbusinesses have had to live with an intense series of destabilising influences. For over  years, businesses in Ireland and the UK have grown accustomed to near frictionless EU market conditions. customs duties had disappeared on all internal EU trading. For businesses on this island, the memory of cross-border customs duties had all been but forgotten.   Looking at the lending performances of some of our own banks, the numbers seem to be adding up. In its full year accounts for , Danske Bank posted pre-tax profit of £.m, while new lending rose % and overall business lending increased by %.Across Donegall Square, Ulster Bank saw its income rising from £m to £m during , while profit after impairments stood at £m. There was a % rise in new corporate lending, while small business rose by %.Meanwhile, across the UK as a whole, Barclays has announced a £bn lending fund as part of a series of initiatives to help small and medium-sized businessesto succeed and flourish through Brexit and beyond.Only older colleaguescan remember the perils of railway journeys interrupted by a one hour stop at Goraghwood station, close to Newry, while all passengers were asked by customs officersthey had ‘anything to declare’. More affluent older travellers would more likely recall the cross-border queuing requirement for the predecessor of the ‘green card’ for cars. Today, the challenge is of how to deliver the political agreement that the border on this island should be either frictionless or non-existent as the UK plans to leave the EU. In the new era there will be redefined relations between NI and the Republic, within the framework of UK-EU relations. The important part lies in negotiations on working arrangements that have not yet officially started.For the remaining part of  and going into , the business scene might be described as getting ‘ready for le after Brexit’.In the last three years the business community which forms the core of the private sector in Northern Ireland has been trading successfully.  The evidence from local reviews of the larger profit making businesses has been encouraging. Year-on-year turnover has been increasing faster than inflation and, even more critically, profitability has been maintained and often improved.Work to identy how well locally owned and controlled businesses have performed has been reassuring. To be included in the review of the Top  more profitable Northern Ireland business, which will be published in more detail, the cut-off point has risen to just on £m annual pre-tax profits. In a further reassuring feature and in contrast to the preceding year, during the year  the number of business casualties fell to a very small number.While the overall performance of businesses in the private sector has been better than is sometimes appreciated, there is a mixture of features in the complex matrix of business performance. The evidence is often from personal subjective sources but the elements do point to a consistent pattern. Businesses have been trading, in general, with improved profits but with turnover rather less buoyant. Employment has been increasing, now more slowly, but pay rateshave not fully recovered from the fall in real earnings in the past decade. Interestingly at a regional and national level, changes in wage rates have not shown the boost of an inflationary increase that might have been expected when unemployment levels have fallen to near record lows.Bargaining in the labour market has been restrained, probably influenced by the siren voices of emerging problems as the Brexit withdrawal agreement has dominated the political and economic policy agenda. This points to the emergence of a contrast between the trend in overall business profitability, which has improved, alongside the trend for inidual personal incomes to lag behind the real levels of the past decade. To a modest degree, business profitability may have improved relative to changes in the costs of the payroll.While the scale of the dference should be treated with caution, as business evolves during the rest of , business finance may be better placed to activate improving investment plans.The post-Brexit business scene should be pointing to reduced uncertainty, even with some predictable new business obstacles, and a helpful change in government economic policy to incentivise faster economic expansion. That prospect, alongside a business sector that has a stronger capacity to invest and grow, makes the months ahead more encouraging than many experts expect.In summary, the business sector is understandably anxious to see aof greater business stability and, for a mixture of reasons, may now be more likely to implement more ambitious investment programmes. Add to this combination the possibility that official Government economic policy will be more flexibleand there is a hope that, out of the recent grey clouds of possible recession, there will be incentives leading to a more buoyant economy here.Just one moment of caution: the brightness of a new dawn in  may be dimmedthe political processes constrain the application of improved economic policies through a refreshed local administration. Business has been performing well, despite the huge levels of uncertainty. However, the political environment could drown out an improving economy. That challenge has not changed.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/graham_11.jpg","title":"word from the wise graham lapsley","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by Ulster Business Name: Graham Lapsley, head of private banking, Danske Bank How did you start out in business   Banking has always been in my blood as my father joined Belfast Banking Co Ltdin . As a boy I remember being in Northern Bank branches ‘helping out’ when my father was completing regular evenings doing overtime. This was an environment that I was familiar with, although I didn’t ever think I would make banking a career. In  I found myself in Limavady branch and thoroughly enjoyed branch banking at a time when there were no computers, no autobanks and lots of staff. I’ve benefited from lots of dferent roles at the Bank in my career, each bringing its own challenges. I left my role as head of personal credit last year to take up my current position as head of private banking. What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far On a personal level changing job roles always brought new challenges. Change is a constant which I accept and while I’ve worked in Danske Bank for  years I have had senior roles in branch banking, wealth management, business banking, risk management and now private banking.   As an area manager in branch banking, I found the leadership of the transition from Australian ownership to Danish ownership in  a huge challenge. This change was as exciting as it was challenging as we benefited from huge investment and the Dane’s leading edge technology. I didn’t go directly from school to university, but I’ve been lucky enough to have had employer support to complete a business studies degree and a masters’ degree in executive leadership. I’ve also attended business schools in Boston, Lausanne and London, with each giving me new tools to add into my skill set.  How would you describe your management style  I am energetic and enthusiastic. I love working with our relationship managers and customers to build a financial solution. I am very results oriented and prefer a direct style. I am very self-awareand have a positive outlook.  What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I’m not sure that I would change anything. I’ve learnt from my mistakes and that made me a better banker in the long term. Perhaps my ambition in my early career took me into roles that didn’t match my skill sets, but I did take away vital learnings from these experiences  Have you done it all on your own  Absolutely not. My we Sonya and family have always been a great support and this enabled me to have a good work le balance. I have a strong network personally and professionally, which is mutually supportive. I’ve also been lucky enough to have worked with many leaders who have greatly inspired me.  What’s more important, your product or your people  In Private Banking, without a doubt our people. We are a people business and our strength in Private Banking rests with the professionalism of the private banking team.

I’ve heard employers bemoan the fact that this generation can’t communicate face-to-face or they place more emphasis on their passions outside of work than their own career development.While some of this is no doubt grounded in their experience, employers perhaps need to adjust how they engage with the new generation beyond just offering them quirky perks and trendy working environments. Hays recently sponsored The GoodIdea, the biggest ever AI hackathon in NI organised by AINIand Hackily – a two-day event hosted by QUB School of Computing and Ulster University Magee campus for around  hackers in Belfast and  in Derry.The hackathon provided a welcoming and collaborative environment for hackers to build out brilliant, innovative, and impactful ideas using AI under a theme of ‘AI for good’, where hackers were challenged to utilise open data sources to create an innovative solution to a real-world problem.It was an opportunity for students – who made up % of the attendees – and experienced professionals to meet fellow hackers, learn new technologies, and work alongside seasoned mentors.Far from being underwhelmed by Generation Z, we were inspired by the talent pools from dferent backgrounds such as computer science, physics and maths, coming together to collaborate with each other, learn about bleeding edge technologies and also to put their skills to use in creating something that was a benefit to society. For example, one of the teams invented an algorithm for a computer to read British sign language using a webcam.These were ambitious, driven, competitive young people who worked brilliantly in their teams and certainly didn’t struggle to communicate, eventhey arrived alone and joined a team. A team from Glasgow made the journey across to take part and the hackathon ran right through Saturday night – so we couldn’t fault their work ethic.There were prizes, mentorship and funding available to the winners of the hackathon, as well as recruitment advice and workshops provided to students and professionals by Hays’ own experts across software development, data engineering and cyber security.But the main attraction was undoubtedly in the opportunity to co-create new ideas about how to apply technology to the world they will run in future. That is hugely positive and our challenge as employers must be to make sure the students who will be the candidates of the future in NI’s thriving tech community are encouraged to put that passion into their careers.The undergraduate community is an under-served community of future leaders in terms of recruitment and our desire is to equip undergraduates with the right understanding of what employers in the tech sector want and how they can build their personal brand for the future.Employers need to get past the myths about Generation Z and focus on helping younger employees find meaning in their workthey are to unlock their potential.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/5g1.jpg","title":"belfast to get superfast g mobile broadband this month","story":"Posted on Wednesday  May  by John Mulgrew Suzanne Wylie, Belfast City Council with Karen Dundas, EE Victoria Square store manager Belfast is to become one of six UK cities to get superfast G mobile broadband later this month, it has emerged.
