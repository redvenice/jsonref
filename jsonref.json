At the time of writing to that constituent the PM\u0027s position did indeed appear \u0027\u0027terminal\u0027\u0027 but that is not the case today. \u0027The PM is building a new team and is earning back support. But of course, there may be more to come out including the outcome of a police investigation.\u0027The Chancellor appeared to suggest that he does not expect to be asked to fill out a police questionnaire about his involvement in an event that possibly broke coronavirus lockdown rules.Rishi Sunak has confirmed he was at the surprise birthday celebration for the Prime Minister on June 19 2020 in the Cabinet room in No 10, but has said he was only there for a scheduled Government meeting.Mr Sunak, asked by Sky News whether he had received a questionnaire from the Metropolitan Police, said: \u0027No.\u0027Asked whether he expected to receive a form to complete, he replied: \u0027No... well, I don\u0027t know.\u0027He also said he did not think he had broken Covid rules.Pressed on whether he has confidence in Boris Johnson still, Mr Sunak added: \u0027The Prime Minister has my total support.\u0027The remarks by the Johnson ally to the Times were slammed by Mr Cummings, a former consigliere turned critic of the PM.Writing on Twitter he agreed with a senior law expert, Professor Mark Elliott, who said the \u0027implication that Police should think more carefully before issuing someone with a fixed penalty because they\u0027re the PM is abhorrent to the rule of law\u0027.\u0027Over past few years of Brexit battles \u0027\u0027rule of law\u0027\u0027 has often been a weasel phrase but Prof Elliott is right this time, Tory MPs are propping up a guy not just trying to fix illegal donations etc but trying to bully cops into treating him differently,\u0027 Mr Cummings said.Tory MP Bob Neill also criticised the remarks today, saying: \u0027It is completely inappropriate to suggest that there should be any special treatment for anyone involved in these inquiries and any suggestion of political pressure on the police is completely reprehensible. No 10 would do well to disown it.\u0027Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: \u0027This veiled threat by Number 10 allies is amongst very heavy competition perhaps the darkest moment of this whole sorry saga.\u0027It shows a fundamental belief in the heart of government that Boris Johnson should be above the law and that Number 10 will bring any institution into disrepute to save Johnson\u0027s skin.\u0027This is a sobering reminder of why we need a cast-iron guarantee that Boris Johnson and his team will have nothing to do with the appointment of Cressida Dick\u0027s successor.\u0027There was a time that the Conservatives called themselves the party of law and order the public will laugh at that very idea for generations.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Barrister wigs culturally insensitive Britains black QC claims colleague afro ordered wear one face disciplinary action","story":"Share this article He added hashtag #HairDiscrimination to his tweet. It comes amid growing calls to outlaw hair discrimination - which often sees black adults and schoolchildren suffer criticism if they don dreadlocks, braids or afros.The hairstyles can be deemed as \u0027unprofessional\u0027 in discriminatory settings due to deep-rooted eurocentric concepts of neatness. Etienne added: \u0027To be clear, I didn\u0027t ask for dispensation.

Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyA proposed temporary cycle lane in Salthill, Galway, will have a negative impact on traffic, will reduce parking availability and will decrease access for older people and those with mobility issues, locals have said in submissions to the city council.A report summarising the public response to the proposed development, prepared for Galway City councillors, states that almost two-thirds of submissions were not in favour of the plan.Last September councillors voted 17 to 1 in favour of temporary segregated cycling infrastructure along the promenade in Salthill. A public consultation on two proposed routes opened on January 14th, running until January 28th, during which time almost 7,000 submissions were received.The first proposed route featured one-way vehicular traffic from the Grattan Road junction to the Barna Road junction, with the second option having two-way vehicular traffic along the R336 (the sea front) and one way vehicular traffic from the Pollnarooma west junction to the Barna road junction.The second proposed route proved more popular among those who were in favour of a cycleway. However, the proposals were isive, with a significant majority of submissions – 63 per cent – taking issue with the plan.“Access to the prom for the elderly and those with impaired mobility is severely impacted. Access to carers and other professional services in all residential areas affected by this will be negatively impacted,” one submission stated.Another, from a resident who lives off Dr Mannix Road, said cars erted from the promenade onto their road would be “a serious issue for endangering children and adults in a very built up residential area”. Response timesBlue light services raised concerns around emergency response times, while Bus Éireann raised a concern about the impact on service delivery.Other submissions were more positive, highlighting the potential to make the area more attractive for tourists, to encourage sustainable transport and to help reduce emissions.“At the moment cycling in Salthill is terrifying, even for an experienced cyclist like myself. Segregated cycle lanes are essential for a modern north European city – otherwise cycling is the preserve of the lunatic fringe,” a submission in favour of the plan said.The motion, under Standing Order 32 to “amend or revoke’’ a resolution of the council, is on the agenda for Monday’s meeting of the local authority when a summary report on the thousands of submissions received will also be considered. The motion is supported by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and a number of Independents. Public spacesIn a statement responding to the motion, Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan said on Friday “we can’t keep our heads in the sand” and continue to let cars dominate public spaces.“The cycle track in Salthill is a critical opportunity to demonstrate that safer roads and alternatives to cars are a priority across parties in Government,” he said,“While Salthill is a very popular destination for families and tourists, it is actually too dangerous for children and families to choose to cycle there at the moment. Galway deserves better. Communities across Ireland deserve better.”Green Party Senator Pauline O’Reilly added that it was “completely out of touch with reality and the future of communities and transport to continue to prioritise cars over pedestrians and cyclists”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"cost of living students grapple with hard choices to make ends meet","story":"University College Dublin student Sadhbh Mac Lochlainn: ‘I’d sometimes have to make a choice between what I want to buy versus whether I want to heat my home’The Republic’s rising cost of living has left students with “difficult choices” to make between prioritising studies and working full-time to pay rising bills and rents.University College Dublin student Sadhbh Mac Lochlainn’s Dublin rent has not increased in recent times, but her weekly food shop has “noticeably gone up” as well as electricity and heating costs.“I got four things in Lidl the other day and it was €9, which is expensive for Lidl. My electricity and heating have gone up a lot since Christmas. I’d sometimes have to make a choice between what I want to buy versus whether I want to heat my home,” she said.More expensive bills have meant that “it’s become a conscious decision when you heat your home” which, for Ms Mac Lochlainn, resulted in a “severe respiratory infection” in the winter.“There is no central heating in our house so we have plug-in heaters, which cost a bomb. These things mean as a student living in Dublin I have to work full-time in order to be able to study here and live here,” she said.Many students’ studies were “taking a back seat” because they have to work full-time.Ms Mac Lochlainn said she was “lucky” to be in part-time education, though this was because she worked full-time.Lower incomesUnder measures agreed by the Coalition on Thursday night to tackle the soaring cost of living countrywide, the previously announced household energy credit of €100 was increased to €200.For students and young people on lower incomes such a measure does not go far enough, said Ms Mac Lochlainn.“Obviously, any extra money is good, but €200 isn’t going to go very far in the grand scheme of things. We want to see actual policies that get to the heart of this, like caps on rent,” she said.Fees for third-level education are also an issue for many students, she said. At €3,000 per year, the Republic has the highest university fees in the European Union, which means “a lot of people have to choose between going straight to work or going into education because it costs so much”.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"officials surprised by russian criticism of defence forces report","story":"Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveney on board the LÉ Samuel Beckett last September. Photograph: Alan BetsonFindings of the Commission on the Defence Forces which were criticised by Russia this week had been cleared by Government ahead of publication. The commission’s report, which was published on Wednesday, cited instability on Europe’s borders as being a major threat to Irish security and quoted EU reports which were strongly critical of Russia.This drew a sharp response from Russian ambassador to Ireland Yuriy Filatov the next day who said the EU reports were “totally unfounded”.It is understood members of the commission and Government officials were surprised by the ambassador’s comments as they had taken care only to cite official comments from EU reports, rather than introducing their own criticismThe section of the report dealing with potential external threats to Irish security, including from Russia, China and far-right and Islamic extremists, was vetted by Department of Foreign Affairs officials to avoid drawing Ireland into a dispute with other nations. The section was cleared by officials with no amendments.UpgradingThe commission has recommended an overhaul and upgrading of almost all sections of the military to enable it to meet the tasks laid out for it by Government. This will cost, at a minimum, €500 million a year in the short term, and, if the most ambitious proposals are accepted, up to €3 billion a year. It has also recommended wide-ranging cultural changes to increase the representation of women and minorities and to improve military working life. Many of these can be implemented at little to no extra costOver the coming months, the Department of Defence, in consultation with the Defence Forces, will refine the options laid out in the report to a series of proposals for which it will seek funding. That requires decisions about what the department and the Defence Forces want to do first.It is understood the Minister for Defence, Simon Coveney, will spend some time consulting with officials and more extensively with all ranks in the Defence Forces to get their views on the priorities, and the realistic timescales for their implementation. In parallel with this, Mr Coveney will seek the backing of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, and the agreement of the Green Party, where concerns about neutrality abound.Obvious difficultyIt is likely to be July before this process crystallises into a proposal to be put by Mr Coveney to the Department of Public Expenditure as part of the normal budgetary process. One obvious difficulty is that the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces will then have to compete with other departments, who also have their own asks, their own priorities, their own reform plans.The report has recommended the establishment of an implementation oversight group, with an independent office and chair.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"people s income is able to purchase less and less that s politically toxic","story":"The potential for political trouble is clear, as Minister of State Seán Fleming found out when he had to apologise for  suggesting that people should shop around to help offset the cost of inflation. Photograph: Daniel Leal AFP via Getty He is one of many seeking help. “It’s a very real crisis, people have been taken aback by the latest energy bill, and there’s plenty of evidence the cost of groceries is going up rapidly,” O’Dea says.A 40-year veteran of the Dáil, O’Dea knows the dangers inflation poses for any government: “As recently as last night a couple of people in the housing estates were saying to me how are they going to survive week to week,” he says.While it is influenced by a whole range of factors outside the Government’s control, that is unlikely to matter much to voters. “All they know is their income is able to purchase less and less, and that is powerful, absolutely politically toxic,” says O’Dea.For several political generations, no government has had to deal with its causes and consequences, but inflation now risks becoming another bread and butter issue, alongside health and housing. “All of a sudden they’re saying, ‘Oh, my God, this bill is double the cost of last year,’” he says, adding that it is not yet the equal of housing or health, but it is affecting “the squeezed middle” who so far are not as badly affected by the other two problems.InterventionOver the past week and a half, since the news emerged that the Coalition was planning an intervention, the impact of inflation on working families and middle income households was a major talking point for Fine Gael in particular. Leo Varadkar repeatedly made the point that people on middle incomes were being hit, and argued for universal payments during the negotiations alongside targeted measures. That seems to have landed – 75 per cent of the €505 million package is taken up with a universal electricity credit of €200 including VAT, to be paid in April. Both Fianna Fáil and the Greens were clear that targeted measures for those on low incomes had to form part of the package, and they do, with a lump sum for those on fuel allowance of €125, and a reduction in the drug payment scheme threshold to €80.However, the combined cost of these measures is €66 million, more than €300 million less than the universal energy payments. An increase to the working family payment and changes to the threshold it is paid at were already announced, but will kick in earlier. Changes to the school transport charges will cost the exchequer only €3 million. The Government will face charges that millionaires are being given a needless subsidy while lower income households struggle. “Basic economic theory says that you help the people on fixed incomes more than you help the people who can work through changes in inflation,” says Stephen Kinsella, professor of economics at the University of Limerick. “They could have targeted the measures to poorer households… the taxpayer is losing the money it gives to me.” O’Dea agrees: “There isn’t enough focus on the low paid,” he says. The Government’s room for manoeuvre was limited by the fact that it wanted to avoid a mini-budget, meaning a whole host of ideas were off the table – firstly, anything to do with tax. Both Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath were said to be stubborn on this point during negotiations: one source said it was an “over my dead body” issue for both. On Thursday the three party leaders and their advisors met Donohoe, McGrath and Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys. The goal was to keep the size to €500 million, and to avoid reopening the social welfare or finance bills - and to target measures that wouldn’t spill over into Budget 2023 - things had to be “targeted, timely and temporary”, one source said. The leaks and briefs of measures were a headwind - and halfway through the process, it became, at least in part, about expectation management. Changes to hospital fees, prescription charges and further assistance for students were among the last items to be dropped.Donohoe was also insistent that the interventions not drive inflation themselves – something Kinsella says was achieved.“The policy design is quite clever in that it minimises the risk of causing inflation using half a billion of taxpayers’ money.” However, given the volume and variety of options that were briefed out to the newspapers, there is a risk that the package can only be seen to disappoint. Across the past week, just a few of the ideas floated which didn’t transpire included: cuts in hospital and prescription fees, cuts to college fees, a bonus for low income and older people, cutting fees for driving licences and passports, VAT on energy charges and road charges, changes to the taxation of bonuses, the temporary deferral of bill payments, and a dedicated hardship fund.Ruralurban ideThe one surprise was a cut in Leap Card fees of 20 per cent, a significant win for the Green Party, delivering a public transport measure, especially amid so much focus on the cost of filling a fuel tank. It’s expected that Eamon Ryan will likely make an effort to retain the cuts. It’s unlikely to soothe tensions, however, around an emerging ruralurban ide within the Government that sees flashpoints on environmental and energy policies already, like the carbon tax. Michael Ring, the Fine Gael TD and former minister for rural affairs, was caustic about the carbon tax earlier this week. “It’s rip-off Ireland again,” he told The  on Wednesday, saying that he pleaded with Eamon Ryan and Donohoe not to put an increase in the carbon tax through last year. The Greens strongly reject this: Neasa Hourigan, the Dublin Central TD, says carbon tax accounts for about one-fourteenth of the increase being seen at the petrol pump, and says that calls for it to be stalled are “really cynical” and “bordering on disinformation”. Hourigan, however, also has views on what should be done to counter inflation. She called for a range of payment increases and interventions on welfare policy during the week and believes the Coalition may have to do more again.“Most of the forecasts are that it will be short lived, so I can see why this package makes sense,” she says. However, she’s not convinced that inflationary pressures will be transitory. “We need short-term, fairly urgent action to make sure people don’t fall into poverty, but we also need longer and medium-term measures,” she says. The potential for political trouble is clear, given Minister of State Seán Fleming’s hapless intervention this week when he suggested people should shop around to help offset the cost of inflation, for which he later apologised. “You can shop around and get a 1 or 2 per cent decrease,” Hourigan says, “but you won’t be able to bridge the gap between this year and last year.” Fleming’s contribution, she says, was “very unfortunate both in terms of the wording of it and the sentiments it expressed”. Government is hopeful that inflation will begin to fall by the middle of the year, but a steep descent is seen as unlikely. Wage pressures are expected across the economy, public and private sector, but the prospect of financial assistance to employers to help counteract this is remote. The coalition is of the view that it is in the process of unwinding supports, not putting new ones in place. Despite the half a billion euro package, the Government is staring down the barrel of yet another problem and inflation looks likely to set the pace for some time to come.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit uk signals it could accept checks on goods for northern ireland","story":"UK foreign secretary Liz Truss meeting European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic for talks in central London  Photograph: Rob PinneyPA Wire The UK has signalled it could accept customs controls on goods destined only for sale in Northern Ireland, its first significant concession during months of talks with Brussels over post-Brexit trading arrangements.Liz Truss, foreign secretary, wants to resolve the dispute over the Northern Ireland protocol - part of the EU-UK withdrawal agreement - which has soured relations between London and Brussels as well as convulsing politics in the region ahead of elections on May 5th.Ms Truss, who travelled to Moscow on Thursday for talks on Ukraine, believes Europe needs to work together to tackle the geopolitical crisis in the east. “Liz thinks western democracies need to work together,” said one ally.London has so far insisted that suppliers of products shipped from Britain intended for sale in Northern Ireland only should no longer have to fill in customs forms as dictated by the protocol.But British negotiators on Friday told their EU counterparts they could accept controls - though far fewer than under existing arrangements or reforms proposed by Brussels.The verbal offer was considered so sensitive it has not yet been provided in written form.The proposal came during Ms Truss’s third in-person meeting with European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic, held in London. British officials said there was “a constructive atmosphere” at the talks.After the meeting the pair issued a joint statement, saying they agreed “on the need for progress in their talks in the interest of people in Northern Ireland, to stay in close touch and that officials will continue intensive discussions in the coming days”.Ms Truss’s team declined to comment but one ally said she had “put forward a series of constructive proposals to address problems created by the protocol” and to bring the two sides closer together. There was no single “offer” and the UK’s fundamental negotiating position had not shifted, they added.Under the terms of the Northern Ireland protocol, all goods going from Britain to the Northern Ireland must follow EU customs and health rules to avoid a trade border on the island of Ireland itself.However the Demcratic Unionist Party (DUP) pulled its First Minister out of the Northern Executive over its disputed contention that the trade border in the Irish Sea impacts on the North’s constitutional status within the UK.DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson’s has said his party would not renominate a First Minister following May’s elections unless there was progress in dealing with unionist opposition to the protocol.The commission in October had offered to create “red and green channels”, in which goods that were clearly destined to remain inside Northern Ireland, such as supermarket deliveries, would only need to provide a single customs form per load. London has now agreed to discuss this idea, but wants declarations to be even less detailed.The two sides have yet to make progress on the trickier issue of health checks on animals and food entering the region. The commission claimed its offer would reduce them by 80 per cent but the UK is unconvinced.Any customs agreement could be ratified by a meeting on February 21st of the Joint Committee, which manages the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland. The talks are then expected to be paused during the election campaign.EU diplomats gave a cautious welcome to the UK proposal. “It’s a positive move but we are not rolling out the red carpet yet,” said one. “There is still a long way between the two sides.”Any concessions made during the talks with Brussels could anger Eurosceptic Conservative MPs, who dislike the protocol negotiated by Boris Johnson, the prime minister, because it puts a trade border in the Irish Sea - within the UK’s internal boundaries. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2022"},{"url":null,"title":"cost of living unions call for pay rises of 5 5 for private sector","story":" Patricia King, general secretary of ICTU. Photograph: Dylan VaughanThe Irish Congress of Trade Unions (Ictu) has called for private sector pay rises of between 2.5 and 5.5 per cent to help workers to cope with the rising cost of living. Ictu’s private sector unions committee met on Friday to discuss rising inflation.Ictu general secretary Patricia King every pay negotiation would have to be cognisant of the employer’s ability to pay, some will be less than the 5.5 per cent, while many other companies were very profitable and could afford to pay wage increases.Ms King said that the committee is also calling on the Government to relax the Small Benefits Exemption rules for employees in from €500 to €1,000. The increase in the tax exemption level would “insulate” workers, she added.“Our job is to ensure that the value of wages doesn’t fall.”She said public sector workers were not insulated against rises in inflation and that would have to be reflected in talks.Asked by reporters on Friday about the union’s remarks , the Taoiseach said society had to be “careful that we don’t try and chase inflation and then end up causing more harm than good”. He said there “have been increases last year and coming into this year”. He said at the last forum involving unions and employers “we did take the opportunity to discuss the inflationary cycle and how we would need to work together in terms of navigating this period and taking initiatives that would help workers but also make sure we do it in an intelligent way.” Mr Martin said there would be “ further soundings between ourselves and the unions and the employers”. He said the biggest pressure was on talent especially in hospitaltiy and this would “create its own upwards pressure on salaries and wages.”Cost of living It comes after the Government on Thursday announced a package of measures to address increases in the cost of living, doubling the energy rebate to €200, cutting public transport fares by 20 per cent and promising a once-off payment of €125 to recipients of the fuel allowance.The package went further than expected, and also included changes to the drug payment scheme (reduced from €100 to €80), the working family payment and school transport fees but was criticised as insufficient by opposition parties and some groups working with the poorest households in the country.Sinn Féin and the Labour Party said the package did not go far enough, while the Social Democrats accused the Government of “tinkering around the edges” of the cost-of-living problem. The Society of St Vincent de Paul said that the Government should have used the resources in a more targeted way to benefit those most in need of help.Support Earlier on Friday Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe defended the measures introduced to address increases in the cost of living, particularly the universal energy rebate, saying it would bring support quickly to those who needed it most.He said the Government had been determined to get the balance right: “These measures will help families. We are using this money to respond to the real challenges people are facing.”Mr Donohoe acknowledged that there were some who had experienced wage growth, but the majority of the measures were geared towards those who needed the most help. “The style of the social welfare system is that it is geared to help those who need it most.”On RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, the Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath also defended the universal energy rebate. He said it would help those who fall outside social welfare thresholds.The Government recognised that the measures would not meet everyone’s needs or would solve all the financial problems people were facing, he said.Earlier on Morning Ireland, Dermot O’Leary of the National Rail and Bus Workers’ Union (NRBU) had expressed concern that the 20 per cent reduction in public transport fares would have an impact on wages of his members.Mr McGrath said that the fare reduction was an important initiative and moved to reassure the NRBU that it would not be at the expense of workers but would come from additional funding.Green Party leader Eamon Ryan defended the universal energy support package saying that its main benefit was that it would go directly to those who needed it and would be done quickly.“We wanted to do something fast that people would see immediately. This goes straight to the consumer, that’s why we picked this route.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"About 2.4 million forced to leave their homes during 13-year-long war with Boko HaramTom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"chalk drum discovered childrens grave important piece prehistoric","story":"A 5,000-year-old chalk “drum”, discovered in the grave of three children has been dubbed “the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years”.The intricately-carved chalk cylinder was first found in 2015, but its existence had not been revealed until Thursday.It\u0027s unearthing helps to prove that at the time Stonehenge was under construction, societies across the British Isles shared artistic and possibly religious customs rather than forming isolated communities.The drum will go on display as part of the World of Stonehenge exhibition that launches at the British Museum on February 17.Neil Wilkin, the curator of the exhibition said: “This is a truly remarkable discovery, and is the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years.”The drum, which has carved motives along its sides closely resembles the Folkton drums, which were found in 1889 and have been in the museum ever since.The new discovery, found in Burton Agnes in East Yorkshire, just 15 miles from Folkton, is only the fourth of its kind to be excavated.The Folkton find, however, was never successfully dated and little was known about the objects’ context.This latest discovery has allowed archaeologists to apply new technologies, including radiocarbon dating, unlocking information not just about the Burton Agnes find but the Folkton drums, too.The date of the burial and therefore the carving of the drums has been put at 3005–2890BC - the same period during which Stonehenge was first constructed.Archaeologists said this was significant because it showed that communities in Britain were sharing artistic styles and possibly religious beliefs across significant distances.Dr Wilkin, said: The elaborate motifs found here on the Burton Agnes drum and also on the British Museum’s Folkton drums, are seen on a range of prehistoric objects discovered across Britain and Ireland.“This tells us that there was an ‘artistic style’ of the people who built Stonehenge. Because we can date the burial this drum was found in, it means we know these ideas existed at the beginning of Stonehenge’s era. It’s game changing in that sense, and hugely exciting.Previously, archaeologists had believed the Folkton drums to have been carved 500 years later, well past the period of Stonehenge’s construction.What this remarkable discovery tells us is that the period of Stonehenge was not insular or shadowy as is often assumed. Here, and in the objects we are showing in the Stonehenge exhibition, we can see shared ideas and artistic styles that have made it to all four corners of these islands almost. Culture and ideas were massively interconnected even 5,000 years ago, just like today, said Dr Wilkin.The children the drum was buried with were of differing ages, with the two younger iniduals placed into the grave holding hands while the eldest child was found embracing them.Dr Wilkin called the grave “highly moving”, saying that “the emotions the new drum expresses are powerful and timeless, they transcend the time of Stonehenge and reflect a moment of tragedy and despair that remains undimmed after 5,000 years.Despite their names, the objects are not musical instruments but are thought to perhaps be protective talismans.The Burton Agnes drum was also found alongside a chalk ball and polished bone pin, which lay beneath the head of one of the children.The significance of both objects is unclear, but similar items have been found at other burials, again suggesting shared culture across Britain.The gravesite was found during routine archaeological excavations ahead of a construction project. For the past seven years, it has undergone extensive study and conservation work.Alice Beasley, a project archaeologist for Allen Archaeology who first uncovered the drum, said: “Discovering the chalk drum was a thrilling and humbling experience. Seeing the love and effort put into burying the iniduals over 5000 years ago was truly moving.”The new drum will go on display in the Stonehenge exhibition alongside all three Folkton drums. It will be displayed at the British Museum on loan from the Burton Agnes Estate.After the exhibition, it will undergo further assessment and analysis.More from NewsChildren aged five to 11 set to be offered Covid vaccines‘They knew each other well’: Prince Andrew pictured with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2002 palace tourIt is folly to think Britain can turn away from producing its own foodMet police braced for further damning WhatsApps to emerge between officers and Wayne CouzensHalf of dog owners wouldn\u0026#39t date someone their pet didn\u0026#39t like, survey findsWe\u0026#39re surrounded on all sides, Ukrainian army warns as Russian forces close inMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ardern trudeau woke darlings western world finally getting comeuppance","story":"Who knew that empathy wasn’t enough? Two leaders who got to their positions by showing how much they can emote, how much they can feel, how much they care, now appear to be in the worst positions of almost any head of government in the democratic world.Take Jacinda Ardern, prime minister of New Zealand. Ardern has always achieved a degree of international fame far beyond that enjoyed by most leaders of her small nation because she is a woman and she appears to really mind. In fact caring is Ardern’s shtick. She is especially good at apologising for things she hasn’t done. Her face crumples, her voice breaks, and the world’s news organisations shout in chorus: “Here is what we need in a leader.”Sadly for the people of New Zealand, that isn’t quite true. Most of the world is emerging from the corona era. Britain, thank goodness, seems to be leading the way, and even recalcitrant countries such as the Netherlands are starting to realise that if the UK is back up and running, you can’t lock down your own people forever.Jacinda seems not to have got the memo. Last summer she notoriously locked down her country again after one man was found to have Covid in New Zealand. I wouldn’t have wanted to have been him. Now, even Australia, which has been one of the strictest, harshest, countries during Covid, has started to lift regulations. And New Zealand?Well, Ardern has announced yet another batch of regulations for her countrymen. New Zealand seems almost hooked on the stuff. The international media once again went doolally for Ardern when she gave a press conference announcing fresh lockdowns and saying that this meant that her own wedding was off. How much she seemed to care! How much her face crumpled as she talked of the plight of her countryfolk! How selfless she was even to cancel her own nuptials!What people should have said was that New Zealand’s prime minister had clearly become a mad person. There was no reason to do this performative caring. There was no reason to sacrifice the opportunity to get hitched. The rules were the problem, and getting rid of them should have been the priority.Instead, everyone got swept along, yet again, on an ocean of Ardern ardour. And on it seems this will go. What will come of New Zealand? Perhaps it will remain always stuck in the summer of 2020, never allowing anyone in or out. Those of us who once went there will tell of it to our grandchildren who will listen in awe to tales of this remote island people who voluntarily cut themselves off from the rest of the world.Or perhaps, if some recent opinion polls are any guide, New Zealand will soon tire of its caring prime minister. Facing a mounting economic crisis, support for Ardern’s party among New Zealanders appears to be collapsing.But it isn’t just Ardern who has this emoting, empathetic act. Perhaps the world leader in this shtick is someone with an even softer voice and even nicer hair: Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau.As time goes on it becomes clear that Trudeau really is the worst leader in the democratic world. His principal qualifications for the role were that he had been a primary school teacher and that his father had been prime minister before him.Other than that, he simply promised to do things differently, to be more empathetic, to emote more, to be more feminine and more understanding. Before lockdown, this manifested itself in international trips during which Justin did more costume changes than the cast of any West End show. But as the Covid era came, Trudeau, like Ardern, seemed to come into his own. He talked about the importance of caring, looking out for each other and other fundamental Canadian values.Unfortunately, if you do not happen to agree with the silken-haired premier, he will have zero time for you. In recent months, as the rest of the world has adapted to Covid, Trudeau seems to have boxed himself into a corner on the matter.In an effort to persuade the population to get vaccinated, Trudeau did everything he could to defame those who disagreed with him. This extended to him dismissing anyone hesitant about taking the vaccine as being (guess what?) racist, misogynistic and more. Trudeau had no evidence for any of this, but this is the modern way of excommunicating any person or group of people. Say that they are racist, misogynistic, homophobic, transphobes and you have successfully un-personed such people.Unfortunately for Trudeau, many Canadians can see through this playground antic and are not persuaded by it. Specifically, Trudeau found that his vaccine demands had riled Canadian truckers.There is no special reason why truck drivers (one of the most isolating professions in the world) should have to display vaccine passports in order to do their work. But Justin decided that they had to, or their livelihoods would come to an end.Gloriously, last month, thousands of truckers drove in convoy to Ottawa. As they arrived there for their protest, Justin decided to pretend he had a headache. Or rather he said that he had met someone who knew someone who had once danced with someone who had Covid. And so the prime minister was doing the reasonable thing and self-isolating.The truckers stayed. At present they remain in Ottawa. Officials have looked into how to criminalise them. They have even looked into criminalising the thousands of Canadians who gathered at the roadsides to show their support. The Ottawa police are now actually stealing the truckers’ fuel and other necessities in an effort to make the protest go away. But the truckers aren’t budging.There is no reason why Trudeau should not make peace with the truckers. Any more than Ardern should not start to walk back from isolating her island nation.But the problem is that when you have presented yourself as the most moral person in the land – the most feeling, the most understanding – and portrayed all your critics as Nazis, it is hard to move to ground we might once have called common. So there Justin is, like Ardern, holed up in a problem entirely of his own making.Empathy is an overrated trick in political leadership. It only gets you so far. Much more important are grit, capability, adaptability and expertise. Neither Ardern nor Trudeau have demonstrated any of these traits. And it is their populations who are suffering as a result. A leader might like to present themselves as limitlessly compassionate, but if you end up having neither compassion nor even understanding for the citizens of your own country, then “compassion” is the problem.More from NewsChildren aged five to 11 set to be offered Covid vaccines‘They knew each other well’: Prince Andrew pictured with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2002 palace tourIt is folly to think Britain can turn away from producing its own foodMet police braced for further damning WhatsApps to emerge between officers and Wayne CouzensHalf of dog owners wouldn\u0026#39t date someone their pet didn\u0026#39t like, survey findsWe\u0026#39re surrounded on all sides, Ukrainian army warns as Russian forces close inMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"european elites can no longer turn blind eye putins imperial","story":"Today, Europe is on the verge of war. Military conflict is no longer an unlikely scenario. It is a real option. For many generations of young Poles and Europeans, this is the closest they will have come to seeing such a scenario play out. For years, the West has trusted that the 21st century would be free of armed confrontation. Recent experience, however, provides sufficient evidence that Russian aggression is no illusion but a sign that a new chapter is opening in the history of the West. Questioning the borders of a sovereign state can only mean one thing: an assault on European stability and security on freedom, democracy, and welfare. This is the greatest political crisis since the end of the Cold War and a direct challenge to the principles adopted by the Euro-Atlantic Community in the years after 1989.  Faced with a growing Russian threat, European governments have largely reacted passively. Leaders have lacked the courage or determination to cut business ties with the Kremlin. The noose is tightening around Europe’s neck, not Moscow’s.  The desire to engage in opaque dealings with a regime that has no qualms about waging war on smaller states, engaging in political assassinations, and employing special forces inside the territory of European Union member-states cannot be perceived as merely short-sighted, but a deliberate act of political cynicism.  Europe is now losing the battle not only in economic terms, through higher gas prices for example, but also politically. Last year, Gazprom stepped up its gas exports to China and Turkey, while sharply reducing deliveries to Europe. This artificial escalation of the energy crisis is a deliberate attempt to force through Nord Stream 2. But the people who will have to pay the price for this mistaken policy are not those signing the contract, but ordinary Europeans.  For all its madness, Russian policy is painfully rational. Vladimir Putin is cynically and effectively exploiting European weaknesses as we enter the third year of an extremely difficult pandemic, face a growing economic crisis, and now an additional menace coming from our eastern neighbour.Unfortunately, many members of the European elites have become adept at ignoring the dazzling rebirth of Russian imperial ambitions. A long list of leaders has opted for Russian cash the case of Gerhard Schroder, who exchanged his political career for stakes in Russian energy companies, is just the tip of the iceberg. Among the many European collaborators of Gazprom, Lukoil, Rosneft, and companies building NS2 are former chancellors, prime ministers, senior diplomats, presidential advisors and ministers. Some apologists speak of the free market and a ‘right’ to accept such jobs after years of public service. But these people have not gained positions by chance. As national leaders, they helped forge European policies on energy, economy, and security. They had access to secret data, and made important strategic decisions. Let us call them what they really are: Trojan horses used by Russia across Europe. Moscow’s intentions leave no room for doubt. Last July, Vladimir Putin published an essay on the historical relations between Russia and Ukraine, arguing that there is no such thing as a separate Ukrainian nation. For Putin, Ukraine is an inseparable part of the Russian world. His objective seems clear: to make the West withdraw its support for Ukraine and allow Russia a free rein.  Nord Stream 2 casts a long shadow over German policy. Thanks to the pipeline, Gazprom will control gas flow across Europe, making deliveries contingent on political decisions. We can already see that Russia is drastically cutting the transit of gas via existing pipelines. Only a small proportion of the available throughput via Ukraine is currently being used, with Gazprom making no bookings of gas transit from the Yamal pipeline. Russia’s energy monopoly is thus a monopoly over decisions regarding Ukraine’s sovereignty.  In the face of this menace, solidarity and cooperation are needed throughout the continent. Europe and its Transatlantic partners should treat events on the EU’s eastern border as a final warning. The West’s most effective bargaining chips will be potential economic sanctions and a clear intention to block NS2. This should not just be the stance of Poland and other Central European nations. In these critical times, we need true leadership to eliminate the present menace and restore Europe to a path of security and development. Mateusz Morawiecki is the Prime Minister of PolandMore from NewsMet police braced for further damning WhatsApps to emerge between officers and Wayne CouzensHalf of dog owners wouldn\u0026#39t date someone their pet didn\u0026#39t like, survey findsWe\u0026#39re surrounded on all sides, Ukrainian army warns as Russian forces close inBritish Army Gurkha cleared of sexually assaulting a female colleague at SandhurstRussia set to invade Ukraine ‘any day now’, warns USNHS Test and Trace to be scaled back as \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 plan takes holdMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"half dog owners wouldnt date someone pet didnt like survey finds","story":"Almost half of dog owners would not date someone that their pet did not like, a Kennel Club survey has found.Some 45 per cent said if their four-legged friend didn\u0027t like a prospective partner, then they would not carry on meeting them, according to the responses from 2,000 people.A further two in five respondents said they would be more likely to go on a date with someone who had a dog.For those who find dates online, one in ten admit choosing potential matches by looking at profile pictures and seeing if a dog is present.The Kennel Club said the research, published ahead of Valentine\u0027s Day, highlights the unbreakable bond that humans and dogs have shared for centuries.It said this means it is not surprising that owners rely on their pet\u0027s instincts when it comes to selecting a partner.Bill Lambert, a spokesperson for the organisation, said: “Clearly there are many benefits of dog ownership, from being an ice-breaker when meeting new people, to providing love and companionship, but of course it isn’t for everybody.“It’s worth remembering the similarities to human relationships a canine counterpart is also looking for long-term commitment, which comes with compromises and changes to your life. And there are 222 different dog breeds in the UK with varying needs and traits, as well as distinct, inidual personalities, so finding ‘the one’ takes time.Two thirds of respondents said their dog is their best friend, nearly a quarter said they prefer their dog to their partner, and three in five admitted they would prefer staying in with their pet rather than going on a date.A further three in five said they would not date someone who doesn\u0027t like dogs.The Kennel Club is the largest organisation in the UK devoted to dog health, welfare and training. Their survey was conducted in August last year.The Kennel Club also said owning a dog should not be seen as an obstacle but a help in finding your soulmate.Mr Lambert suggested that dog owners who find it hard to find a suitable date should socialise at events such as Crufts, where they are more likely to meet fellow dog lovers.More from NewsChildren aged five to 11 set to be offered Covid vaccines‘They knew each other well’: Prince Andrew pictured with Ghislaine Maxwell in 2002 palace tourIt is folly to think Britain can turn away from producing its own foodMet police braced for further damning WhatsApps to emerge between officers and Wayne CouzensWe\u0026#39re surrounded on all sides, Ukrainian army warns as Russian forces close inBritish Army Gurkha cleared of sexually assaulting a female colleague at SandhurstMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"john bercow weakest link goodbye","story":"Poor John Bercow. The former Commons speaker was voted off in one of the early rounds in a celebrity edition of the BBC television programme The Weakest Link, a few weeks after appearing on The Wheel. Presenter Romesh Ranganathan had to break the news to him. “John, I am afraid that with five votes you are the weakest link – goodbye.”Bercow put a brave face on his latest setback, saying: “It is an abject humiliation. Obviously, I feel deeply ashamed. Will I be able to bear the shame? I don’t know. I will attempt through stoicism and fortitude to bear up but it has been a bad day for Bercow.”It’s almost enough to make you feel sorry for him.The inner workings of the Conservative Party are never straightforward so it is little surprise that the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs marks its centenary next year, not this year. Sir Graham Brady, its chairman, has signed up Lord Norton of Louth to write the centenary book.Of more interest to historians might be the prospect of a memoir being considered by Brady himself, who has run the show since 2010 and overseen two leadership elections and attempts by the whips to dislodge him. Brady has not been keeping a detailed diary, unlike his predecessor, Michael Spicer, whose well received Spicer Diaries were published in 2013.“But I have been keeping some notes,” he tells me with a smile.Isn’t it time for some sort of honour for Michael Crick, whose new biography of Nigel Farage is garnering rave reviews? Crick, who was political editor of Channel 4 News and BBC Newsnight, has penned biographies of Arthur Scargill and Jeffrey Archer over the years.A proud Mancunian, Crick has a home in Crook in the Lake District. “I would like to be Lord Crick of Crook,” he tells me. Quite right!Scotland Yard has published details of parties on eight dates in 2020 and 2021 that it is investigating as part of Operation Hillman. But Brexiteers are scratching their heads about why there was apparently no lockdown-busting party in Downing Street on December 31 2020, when Britain officially left the EU’s single market and customs union. Was our freedom not worth marking?Speaking of celebrations, it has been revealed that British taxpayers paid £700 for a leaving party last November for the BBC’s departing North America editor Jon Sopel and 86 invited guests at the British Embassy in Washington. Tory MPs are unhappy. Julian Knight, the chairman of the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee, asks: “Why are the public paying for a knees-up for a BBC journalist who is already paid for by the taxpayer – is it a case of ‘double bubble’?”A Foreign Office spokesman says: “Hosting events allows our embassies around the world to pursue the UK’s objectives. This is normal diplomatic practice.” A source adds that “English sparkling wine was served, paid for privately at no expense to the taxpayer”.Couldn’t Sopel – who was paid between £235,000 and £239,999 a year by the BBC in 2020 – pay for the whole thing himself?Andrew Lloyd Webber has clearly had enough of Covid. Welcoming back the audience on stage at the reopening of Cinderella last week, the composer – who threatened to risk being jailed to reopen his shows during the lockdowns – asked: “What is the anagram of omicron and delta?

He may have proved a terrible prime minister, losing most of Margaret Thatcher’s majority in 1992 before being ked by Tony Blair in 1997, but the Remoaner-in-Chief can now add a new epithet to his chequered CV.For this week, we discovered Edwina Currie’s former lover’s greatest achievement in life. In a crowded field of deluded referendum losers determined to talk Britain down, the man who was humiliatingly bundled out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism in 1992 is arguably king.Describing Boris Johnson’s administration as “distinctly shifty” with a straight face on Thursday, the premier who presided over cash for questions once again reminded us that, when it comes to those obsessed with reversing Brexit, hypocrisy knows no bounds.And he is far from alone. Just look at the reaction of other extreme Remainers to Sergey Lavrov’s attempts to undermine Foreign Secretary Liz Truss – an event which coincided with More-Peas-Norma’s self-serving speech at the Institute for Government, the establishment think tank.Lavrov, who has been Russia’s minister of foreign affairs since 2004, already had form on the world’s stage for being, to quote one of George W Bush’s officials, “a complete a-------”.Known as “Mr Nyet” (Mr No) in Russia, Moscow’s whisky-drinking, chain-smoking top diplomat has carved out a reputation for effing and blinding as he has slavishly devoted himself to Vladimir Putin’s cause.According to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, he behaved like a “jerk” during negotiations with the US. Obama administration officials told the Politico media company that he was an “anti-diplomat” with “nothing redeemable” about his “uncharismatic, offensive, uncompromising, cruel, unlikeable, brusque, caddish” character.Yet regardless of seemingly being the Kremlin’s answer to the Duke of York, some useful idiots in Britain chose to lap up his criticism of Truss, whom he described as “deaf and mute” following unconstructive talks over Ukraine.Lionel Barber, former editor of the Financial Times, was one of the first out of the traps, tweeting: “Lavrov – Putin’s Gromyko – eats Liz Truss alive on camera, dismissing her as an ignorant lightweight who spends too much time on social media. Easy to have anticipated this payback!”Would this be the same Lionel Barber who, when he interviewed Putin on the eve of the G20 summit in 2019, asked probing questions including: “How have you seen the world change over the past 20 years while you have been in power?” and “Are you putting too many eggs in the China basket?”Asked by Putin whether he thought it was Russia’s fault that a woman was killed during the Salisbury poisonings, Barber replied: “I did not say that. I said somebody died.”Well, to be fair, no one wants to be Novichoked on their way into work, do they?Max Seddon, the FT’s Moscow bureau chief, joined the fray, tweeting: “The public dressing down Lavrov gave Liz Truss was so brutal, and the gap between them so yawning, you almost have to wonder why they even had the meeting – and Lavrov did indeed wonder that aloud during an excruciating press conference in Moscow.” With friends like these, one wonders why the Soviet Union ever needed a Politburo.Others who decided to condemn Truss, rather than Lavrov, included Mike Galsworthy, founder of Scientists4EU, who tweeted: “I f---ing despair. Our cabinet of fools are far too lightweight for this. Liz Truss seems like she’s winging some sort of student politics against extremely hardcore players … and is distracted from detail by thinking about her photo ops. It’s really, really not good.”Yes Mike, perhaps it would be better if we had a more “hardcore” foreign secretary who carried polonium-210 around in her handbag?I mean, I don’t know about you, but I’m not sure I’d rather be backing the bloke who was given a favourable welcome by thousands of pro-Assad supporters in 2012 before the Syrian president went on to launch a chemical weapons attack on Ghouta, gassing hundreds of children.Truss’s crime by comparison was probably best summed up by the “luxury communist” Ash Sarkar, contributing editor at hard-Left Novara Media, who tweeted: “Now I’m not saying Liz Truss is a lightweight, but if your first priority on arrival to Russia during escalating tensions on the Ukraine border is to stage a Maggie T photoshoot, then…”I’m not sure what is more worrying, that these anti-Brexiters and Communist sympathisers fell for Lavrov’s lines, hook line and sinker – or that they were aware of what they were doing, and did it anyway?Whatever happened to Brexit being a Russian plot?I appreciate that this conspiracy theory has been debunked by every investigation that has been carried out into it – but isn’t it telling that these Remainers don’t seem to mind Russian interference in Western democracies provided that they agree with it.I’m the last person at this newspaper to argue that our own Government is in a good place right now, but I would suggest that, compared with Russia, our democracy is looking positively peachy, not least as some Tory MPs continue to conspire to remove the Prime Minister (a luxury that is not afforded the average Russian politician, let alone voter).But it is now six years since the Brexit vote. When are the commanding heights of Remain going to let it go? If it wasn’t bad enough that we had to endure John Major, wheeling himself back out again to give us the latest fruits of his Brexit sulk, we have now got to endure all those people who happily trashed him in the Nineties pretending that he is some sort of political Messiah.He isn’t the Messiah, he’s just a bitter man with a pompous mission to rewrite the story of his own failure which led to a decade in the wilderness for the Conservative Party.Far from galvanising more Tory support to overthrow Boris Johnson, all his speech surely achieved was to push MPs who had been considering submitting a letter of no confidence in the opposite direction. Why? Because those who dislike Johnson, but not enough to have already written to Sir Graham Brady, dislike Major even more.Rather than listening to Remainers parroting the New York Times’s latest ridiculous missive on “broken Britain” (like they can talk!), most Conservatives want to talk Britain up, not down.The Government’s problem, and it was exposed in the mockery of Jacob Rees-Mogg canvassing the public for ideas on EU deregulation, is that it hasn’t yet done enough to maximise post-Brexit opportunities.From the delay in implementing the report from the Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform (TIGRR) to the watering down of the free ports plan, not to mention the continued row over the Northern Ireland Protocol, No 10 simply hasn’t got Brexit done well enough.Yes, there have been some notable triumphs the vaccination rollout, for starters and then, this week, Britain leading the way on nuclear fusion power after breaking the world record for the amount of energy produced from the process in one go at a plant in Oxfordshire.Remainers had argued that this sort of collaboration with our partners across Europe would be impossible post-Brexit. We knew they were wrong then and we know they are wrong now – but the Government has to continue to prove it. Otherwise our enemies will continue to make use of our idiots.More from NewsMet police braced for further damning WhatsApps to emerge between officers and Wayne CouzensHalf of dog owners wouldn\u0026#39t date someone their pet didn\u0026#39t like, survey findsWe\u0026#39re surrounded on all sides, Ukrainian army warns as Russian forces close inBritish Army Gurkha cleared of sexually assaulting a female colleague at SandhurstRussia set to invade Ukraine ‘any day now’, warns USNHS Test and Trace to be scaled back as \u0026#39living with Covid\u0026#39 plan takes holdMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"keir starmer speaks out over","story":"Keir Starmer speaks out over Jimmy Savile slur mob - and blames Boris JohnsonLabours leader said Boris Johnson knew exactly what he was doing and hell never be persuaded there was no link after a group branded him a paedophile protector outside ParliamentKeir Starmer being surrounded outside Parliament Image: PAByPatrick DalyMeg HillDan Bloom:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb Sir Keir Starmer has blamed Boris Johnson for the group of antivax protesters who accosted him, saying the Prime Minister knowingly pedalled a conspiracy theory of violent fascists. In an interview with The Times, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had used a deliberate slur without any basis in fact. The PM knew exactly what he was doing. It is a conspiracy theory of violent fascists that has been doing the rounds for some time, he said. Mr Johnson last week ly accused his rival of failing to prosecute notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile while he was director of public prosecutions.On Monday, police escorted the Labour leader away from demonstrators, some of whom accused him of protecting paedophiles. I have never been called a paedophile protector before. That happened yesterday for the first time in my le, Sir Keir said.  If others want to argue that this is unconnected with precisely what the Prime Minister said one week before then let them make that case. But theyaposll never persuade me that there is no link. Itaposs not about me, itaposs the way we conduct our politics. I donapost want to see us go down the route that this potentially takes us. Earlier, Sir Keiraposs spokesperson said he was fine after the incident. A spokesman for the opposition leader told reporters: He was back at his desk straight after. Police did their job. Obviously these things look sort of rougher on the camera often than they are. But, as I say, police did a good job, he was back at his desk afterwards and he was off playing five-a-side football that night as normal. A host of Conservative and opposition MPs have called for Mr Johnson to apologise for what was branded a scurrilous accusation against Sir Keir.  The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman acknowledged his original words last week in the Commons were capable of being misconstrued and said that was why he subsequently issued a clarication.The Prime Minister claried his remarks last week to make clear he was not suggesting Keir Starmer was inidually responsible for the Savile decision, the spokesman said.He added: I think the Prime Minister was making a political point about taking responsibility for organisations as a whole. Mr Johnson tweeted on Monday evening that the behaviour directed at the Labour leader was absolutely disgraceful. Although Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service in  when a decision was taken not to prosecute Savile, he had no personal involvement in the deliberations.Labour said Mondayaposs incident occurred when Sir Keir, who was accompanied by shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, was walking back from the Ministry of Defence after a briefing on the situation in Ukraine.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour PartyThe TimesMinistry of DefenceJimmy SavileDavid LammyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves. A Brit special Brits starring in Oscar nominations and at tonight’s Brits awards is great news. When it comes to films and music, we’re seen and heard all around the globe.

The London police force has faced a number of scandals and dficult moments under Dickaposs tenure, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he was not satisfied the -year-old was the person to take it forward amid a loss in confidence in the force. Public fury was raised over the Sarah Everard case, in which a young woman was raped and murdered by serving Met police officer Wayne Couzens, and WhatsApp texting scandals that showed both misogynistic and racist attitudes from officers serving on the force.The Mayor said: It’s clear that the only way to start to deliver the scale of the change required is to have new leadership right at the top of the politan Police.  Dick said it was with huge sadness that she is stepping back after taking the role in .The first openly gay commissioner of the Met will stay on in the role until a new head is found. Who is Cressida Dickaposs partner   Very little is known about Dickaposs private le, but her partner is a now retired Met inspector known only as Helen.Dick told the Daily Mail in : She was a duty inspector in a busy London borough. It was a big, demanding job — she loved it and I am biased, of course, but she was really good at it.In what was a landmark moment, Dick became not just the first woman in the Metaposs top job, but the forceaposs first openly gay serving commissioner in .  Speaking on Desert Island Discs in , Dick claimed that one of the least interesting things about her is her sexuality. She said: Sometimes people say to me that they think it’s important, but to be honest, for me, I think it’s one of the least interesting things about me. Despite this, many in the LGBTQIA+ community saw her appointment as a signicant step on the road for promoting equality of people from all backgrounds, genders and sexualities. Why has Cressida Dick resigned   The Met has faced repeated dficulties, culminating in a concerning perception of serving officers. Among other scandals, the abduction, rape and murder of Sarah Everard, and the subsequently controversial dealing of a vigil held in Clapham marking her death, were met with public outcry. Members of the public voiced their concerns about serving police officers - not helped by the most recent scandal of her tenure, in which an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct found vile misogynistic messages on WhatsApp and Facebook messenger groups held by Charing Cross police officers. Chats saw them joke about slapping your missus about and calling women daft c**ts for getting murdered by their partners. The Met was also accused of a aposstitch-upapos - which it denied - regarding the handling of the Number  Partygate scandals after it emerged a senior officer overseeing complaints about Partygate is the brother of Health Secretary Sajid Javid.Dame Cressida acknowledged the Metaposs failings in her statement, which said: The murder of Sarah Everard and many other awful cases recently have, I know, damaged confidence in this fantastic police service. There is much to do – and I know that the Met has turned its full attention to rebuilding public trust and confidence.

Now the pair are back behind bars after being jailed for their latest crime last month. Police quickly established who the suspects were and arrested OaposDonnell and Hannay shortly afterwards.Enquiries later revealed that a second aggravated burglary had taken place where the occupant sustained an injury. O’Donnell and Hannay, , both pleaded guilty to two charges of aggravated burglary and one charge of  imprisonment.They were remanded in custody and were sentenced at Worcester Crown Court on February . OaposDonnell received a seven-year jail term, while Hannay was jailed for eight years. It is not the first OaposDonnell has made headlines.  In June last year, she was named by cops as she was wanted for recall to prison while awaiting sentencing for stealing a car. She was facing a prison term in November  after pleading guilty to taking a car without the owner’s consent, driving otherwise than in accordance with a licence and driving without insurance. The court heard how OaposDonnell, who was pregnant at the time, had a long history of drug and alcohol misuse. Her lawyers at the time argued that OaposDonnell was the victim of domestic violence. Last February, Anthony Hannay, also went on the run - but was eventually found hiding in the attic of a house in Worcester.Whilst on the run, Hannay appeared to be taunting officers by posting comments on the Facebook appeals West Mercia Police was making in their bid to find him.Someone using his name goaded them, with comments like: Catch meyou can and Just cooking my steak so come after.

Dame Cressida announced on Thursday she would be stepping down after losing the backing of London Mayor Sadiq Khan in the wake of a series of scandals during her tenure leading. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was not satisfied Dame Cressida could root out the racism, sexism, homophobia, bullying, discrimination and misogyny that still exist in the force or restore Londonersapos trust.Dame Cressida acknowledged the Metaposs failings in her statement, which said: “The murder of Sarah Everard and many other awful cases recently have, I know, damaged confidence in this fantastic police service. There is much to do – and I know that the Met has turned its full attention to rebuilding public trust and confidence.”Describing her decision to resign, she said: “It is with huge sadness that following contact with the Mayor of London today, it is clear that the Mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue. He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the politan Police Service. The mayor and Home Secretary Priti Patel will now begin the search for a new Commissioner.Without a clear frontrunner to replace the outgoing commissioner, here is a look at some of the likely candidates Neil Basu  Neil Basu, another assistant commissioner who previously worked as the head of counter-terrorism, is thought to be a likely candidate. Mr Basu has spent his entire career serving in the politan Police.In a  interview with , he said thatsomeone used the racially offensive comments Boris Johnson had, they would not be admitted into the police force.For some, the comments were seen as political and could prove detrimental to his chances of succeeding Dame Cressida. But Mr Basu is popular among officers and is still widely seen as capable. He is also the most senior police officer of Asian heritage and would be the first minority ethnic commissioner.Matt Jukes  Matt Jukes, an assistant politan Police commissioner currently working as head of counter-terrorism, is seen by many commentators as a likely contender.Mr Jukes first joined South Yorkshire Police as a Pc before moving to South Wales Police and working his way up the ranks.He rose to become chief constable of South Wales Police before ing to the politan Police as an assistant commissioner in . So unlike Dame Cressida, who never ran her own force before becoming commissioner, he has prior experience at the helm. Sir Stephen House  Sir Stephen House is the Deputy Commissioner of the politan Police, just below Dame Cressida, and so is a natural contender for the job.The Scottish police officer has worked in several dferent forces and was appointed chief constable of Police Scotland in .However, during his tenure leading Police Scotland he faced criticism for his use of armed patrols as well as stop and search. He eventually resigned in  over the deaths of Lamara Bell and John Yuill, who lay undiscovered in a wrecked car for three days despite a call from a member of the public. But in , he became an assistant commissioner at the politan Police and was promoted to deputy commissioner by the end of the year.Lucy DaposOrsi Current Chief Constable of the British Transport Police, Lucy previously worked as a senior officer at the politan Police. During her career, she was in charge of the police response to the Beaufort Park fire in  and she headed up security during Chinese leader Xi Jinpingaposs visit to the UK in .She would be following in Dame Cressidaaposs footsteps as the second woman to become politan Police commissioner. Nick Ephgrave  Nick Ephgrave, assistant commissioner for frontline policing, is also in with a chance of getting the top job.Mr Ephgrave began his career at the politan Police but moved to become chief constable of Surrey Police in late .In , he ed to the politan Police as an assistant commissioner. Like Mr Jukes, he also already has experience leading a police force. Families of those failed by the Met Police have also spoken out since Cressida Dickaposs announcement to step down. The brother of Stephen Lawrence, who was killed in a racially motivated attack in , has said the politan Police commissioneraposs resignation was needed and it has set the police on a pathway now of seeing real change. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Stuart Lawrence said: I have met her a good couple of times and those meetings always have been productive, she has always come across to me personally as someone who wants to implement change and wants to see things done dferently, but she just hasnapost been able to really put that down to the rest of the forces and the people who are responsible for the dferent teams throughout the politan Police force.Its a big service, thereaposs lots of dferent members and lots of dferent moving parts and itaposs a big job and we really need someone thataposs going to be put in post now thataposs going really to be able to stamp a real clean step of a new direction to go in. Ricky Waumsley, whose partner Daniel Whitworth was murdered by serial killer Stephen Port, said he didnapost have much faith in Dame Cressida Dick when he met her just before Christmas. He said he welcomed her resignation as she definitely needed to go. Outlining his meeting with the former Met chief after an inquest into the deaths of Portaposs victims concluded in December, Mr Waumsley told the Today programme on BBC Radio : It went OK. She came across [as] friendly and she said she was going to look into improving the Met Police, but I didnapost really have much faith in her.  Explaining why, he said it was due to a combination of the scale of what had happened and because of that meeting. Thereaposs so much homophobic, sexist and racist stuff going on within the Met Police right now. I donapost think she is capable of sorting out these issues, he said. He said he is calling for an investigation into the officers who handled the case to be reopened. Last year, Assistant Commissioner Helen Ball issued an apology on behalf of the Met but rejected the claim that homophobia played a part in its investigation into Port.

AS is a long-term inflammatory condition that causes her pain and stfness, as well as periods of chronic fatigue. While it can be managed with medication and movement, her job at the University of Cambridge required full-time commitment and sitting at a desk added to Emma’s pain. “My diagnosis came with a sense of loss of what I envisaged the future to be,” Emma said. Around the same time, Emma noticed something was wrong with her dog Thea.  “She started missing her jumps on the sofa and wanted to turn around and go home early on walks,” Emma said. Vets diagnosed Thea with mild arthritis, and together, the pair adapted to their new realities. A busy schedule made it dficult for her to take care of herself and find time to take Thea to her many appointments. The turning point for Emma was when she realised that she couldn’t reduce her working hours. “I applied to go part-time and I was declined because I was a manager. I couldn’t just clock off,” she explained. So, Emma left and found a new part-time job that allowed her more spare time and flexibility.  “Financially, it was daunting making the jump to leave my career but I felt my lestyle had to change,” Emma said.

As reported last week, Greggs has teamed up with Primark for the very first time on a unique cafe experience and clothing range. The collab feels like a long overdue fit for the two high street legends, with Nottingham-based interior designer Philip Watts bringing a fun and energetic feel to whataposs been described as the most ‘Instagrammable Greggs in the world’.The doors to Tasty by Greggs officially open in Primarkaposs giant flagship store on Saturday, February . However, I was fortunate enough to get a sneak peek ahead of the launch, and feel I can now at long last officially add the role of apospasty influencerapos to my CV.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Although the Tasty by Greggs cafe is far more than just your average Greggs, the menu will be very familiar to all Greggs fans, with all your favourite treats present and correct - nothing brand new or dferent being sold here.Seems a bit of a shame they didnapost decide to create a limited-edition Primark-themed doughnut or something with bright neon colours to match the playful interior. With nothing new on offer to tantalise my tastebuds, I opted for a trusty vegan sausage roll followed by a sugar strand doughnut, all washed down with a vanilla latte from the quirky self-serve coffee cart. Although I know not everyone is keen on self-service coffee, I personally enjoyed this aspect of the restaurant, which really does enhance the relaxed feel of the place. I can absolutely imagine nipping in for aposjust one coffeeapos before staying for three. As big as the cafe and host store are, the sausage rolls and doughnuts were unfortunately standard-sized, which was, admittedly, another small disappointment. However, it does mean thereaposs always room to eat more!  Being Northern, Iaposm more than happy queuing up at small Greggsapos chains during hurried lunch break runs. However, Tasty by Greggs brings a completely new dynamic to the beloved bakery experience that I didnapost even know I needed in my le until now.You will also still very much feel like you are in Greggs, albeit Greggs when looked at through an influencer-worthy Instagram filter. Tasty takes things to the next level, seating as many as  people in a spacious and above all very chilled-out space. However, despite its size, Tasty doesn’t have the sort of impersonal, hectic feel that a lot of large high street cafes have. Divided into distinct sections, Tasty has a fun, home-from-home feel, and you can absolutely imagine flopping down here with your shopping bags to st through new purchases at your leisure. Those wanting a summery feel in drizzly February can park themselves in the light and airy Greggs picnic area, which is fitted with picnic benches well-suited to weekend catch-ups over brews. Meanwhile, selfie lovers will be in their element, with the most ‘Instagrammable Greggs in the world’ certainly living up to its name.My personal favourite feature was the cute sprinkle doughnut swing, surrounded by neon signage and tailor-made to show off your latest Primark haul.I can imagine this will prove popular, so Iaposd definitely advise grabbing yourself a seat at one of the nearby half doughnut booths while you wait for it to free up.  Much like the chain thataposs kept Brits coming back again and again since , Tasty offers a friendly, welcoming experience, all while bringing something a little new and vibrant - itaposs the perfect accompaniment to any serious Primark shopping spree. Tasty by Greggs will open at Primark’s Birmingham store at . am on Saturday, February , and can be found between men’s and ladieswear on Primark’s - Mezzanine floor.

The four-bedroom detached property in Hilington borders the , acre estate and is also close to Anmer Hall, the country home of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The Royal Family spends several weeks of the year at the Sandringham estate, including Christmas. If you want the chance to catch a glimpse of the Royals during the festive season, all you have to do is shell out £, for the property. For that price, you get stylish glazed walls, a large back garden, and a view of St Mary the Virgin Church, where the Queen sometimes visits while in residence at Sandringham.  The property has been listed by estate agents Brown  Co who say the bungalow was built in the late s and is in superb order. They also say it is flooded with natural light from the clever architectural design and large windows.  The property has been giving planning permission to build a three bedroom detached house and garage at the end of the property, which could add £, to its value. The couple who are selling it has lived there for  years, have re-roofed it and carried out extensive renovations on the property in recent years. The kitchen is designed and fitted with quartz worktops and floor to ceiling glazed windows as well as sliding doors.There is a sitting room described as a stunning formal space and a reception hallway leading into an open plan dinning area and the kitchen breakfast room. A family room can be converted to a fth bedroomthe new owners have use of it, while the master bedroom has an en-suite shower room and sitting room so you can get a bit of quiet timeyou need it. The current owners use the sitting room as their study. There is a family bathroom, a laundry room, and access to a double garage, as youaposll need a car to get around the area.The bungalowaposs amazing location means you wonapost get much noise, particularly as it is set back from the road behind a wall and security gates. Itaposs in walking distance from a shop, a petrol station, a garage, a pub, and the Queen – what more could you need  Lee Shauardson from Brown  Co said: There is a lot of interest in the property because it appeals to quite a mixed bag of buyers. “There is some interest because of the building plot – but a lot of people just see it as a fantastic house in Norfolk, and in close proximity to the coast. Being next to Sandringham makes it even more attractive, he says. He added: Sandringham has beautul countryside and woodland, and there are plenty of areas which have public access.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeRoyal FamilySandringham\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He could be heard pleading with passers-by for a cigarette as he banged on the shutters at .am on Feb th. And one man on his way to work found his pleas so hilarious he filmed him. Musician Ethan Brahney, , was walking through the city centre at .am when he heard the manaposs desperate cries. He realised they were coming from behind the shutters, which protect the main store windows of Wilkos in Lancaster. In Ethanaposs video, the stricken man can be heard banging on the metal doors.Ethan says: You alright mate  to which he replies: I canapost get out! Ethan replies: How did you get in there  and he replies: I fell asleep last night and someoneaposs locked me in! Ethan then says: Youaposve been locked in the shutter  and the man says: Yeah. Ethan then adds: Sh*t man Iaposll give Wilkos a call and seeanyoneaposs there. Hilariously the trapped partygoer then pleads: Have you got a cig on you mate  Cracking up, Ethan replies: Nah man, I donapost even know how Iaposd get it to you, thereaposs a f*cking grill in the way. I canapost even see you. That is f*cking class man. Heaposs stuck in the gutter, in the grill. Ahh I tell you what man you have just brightened my morning up with that. All the best brother. Ethan then continues on his way to work, laughing.  He said he didnapost call Wilkos as the store opened in  minutes and he knew the man would get rescued then. Wilkos Lancaster shuts at :pm, meaning the man must have been there for almost  hours. Ethan explained: I was going to work, Iaposve no idea about anything before I saw him. I assume heaposd just had a night on the drinks, fallen asleep and the shutters have come down automatically when the shop closed. Weaposve all had a rough night like that - you canapost blame the lad for wanting a kip. Iaposm not sure about how people didnapost see him because itaposs not asit was dead, there were a few people out and about. I Googled the number, but saw the store opened not too long after I was there. I thought of calling but thoughtthe shutters are down thereaposd be no one in as theyaposd have to open the shutters to access the store. I saw that the store was opening very soon after I found him and I had to get to work so I went. Obviouslyhe was in pain or discomfort I wouldaposve helped but he was chilling asking me for a fag. If the first question was more alarming than that I wouldaposve done more to help. I think heaposd just been on a night out, I thinkhe was homeless he wouldaposve had a spot thataposs more permanent. Iaposve no idea who the guy is, thataposs why Iaposm keeping the video up, the guyaposs anonymous so itaposs a funny video rather than a mocking one. Wilkos has been contacted for comment.

Across the road, there was meant to be another crescent that would form a circus, but financial problems during the first development meant the other half was never built and the land was named Park Square instead.

The houses were for the wealthy – andyou were rich enough to get your hands on one you would have exclusive access to the gardens in Crescent and Park Square, as well as a nursemaid to look after your children. But because of the busy road between the two areas, an underground tunnel was dug out in  to keep the children safe and for the nursemaids to use, giving the hidden space the name of aposNursemaidsapos Tunnelapos.

The tunnel connects both gardens and has sloping approaches which were perfect for prams and children, and it is still in use today - but because the gardens are private for residents of the wealthy street, the public rarely gets to see it. However, it is accessible to visitors during the annual Open Garden Squares weekend for London history lovers, which will take place this year on Saturday  and Sunday  June, .Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON property newsViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The resident watched the incident on his home CCTV camera at around noon last Friday , reports North Wales Live.He was in the bathroom of his three-bedroom home when he heard a knock at the door, followed immediately by the sound of the door handle being turned by the driver in question. The man, who wished to remain anonymous, said: I just think itaposs unusual. The Hermes delivery man pulled outside my house with a parcel, he walked up the drive, knocked the door, and then immediately pulled on the handle. I know what sound my front door makes when someoneaposs trying to open it. I was upstairs at the time in the bathroom and it was a bit of a shock.Have you had a similar encounter  Let us know at webnews@mirror He then ran from the bathroom to tell the driver to leave the parcel at the door. The resident added: I stuck my head out of a window to tell him. Iaposm not sure whether they should be doing it or not but it could be quite frighteningit was an elderly person living by themselves.  He added that the driver had his hood up which made it look like he was trying to hide [his] identity. He said: I sent a complaint to Hermes and they told me that the driver thought we had a porch and that he was trying to leave the parcel in it [a designated safe place]. However, the resident claried that they donapost have [a porch] and the door opens into [their] living room. EvenI did have a porch, I wouldnapost want people letting themselves in, he said. A spokesperson for Hermes said: We have raised this with the local team who have spoken to the courier involved. This was a genuine mistake as the courier believed it was a porch - we will ensure it wonapost happen again.

Speaking to the Daily Star, Quinn described an alleged incident where Meghan felt she was not being treated with the same respect as Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, while she and husband Prince Harry lived at the Palace.Meghan and Harry were living in whataposs called Nottingham Cottage and itaposs probably the only bit that you genuinely really could say, is actually quite small,” Quinn said. And so, I think that reminded Meghan that she was, as it were, second place or as the runner-up.  So, when Harry and Will got together and sometimes Meghan and Kate as well because there was this tension occasionally, famously Meghan slightly lost her temper with a member of Kateaposs staff in front of Kate. And it was that incident, that I was told by someone who was actually there, who said it was really uncomfortable because Meghan just lost it with this person. The reason she lost it with Kateaposs member of staff was that she, Meghan, didnapost feel that this person was giving her the sort of attention she deserved. It was almost asin that one encounter, it encapsulated for Meghan the problem that she had, that sheaposs a Princess and sheaposs number two.  He added: She was very successful, coming into this alien environment where people behave towards you according to where you are in the status of who becomes King or Queen next, thataposs just alien to her. The way it was described to me was, there were raised voices and foot-stamping. It is further claimed that the incident left Kate feeling really upset. Mr Quinn continued: Meghan asked this person, I know who it was, but I canapost say because it will give away my source, who works for Kate who was basically asked to do something by Meghan and said, aposIaposm really sorry I canapost do that because I work for Kateapos. And Meghan really felt she had been slightly put in her place becauseyou become a Princess, you kind of assume that staff when you ask them to do something, they are going to do it. He added: Shewas horried, she was really upset because sheaposs very fond of this particular member of staff and she thought that Meghan almost bowling out this person was just completely unacceptable. Sheaposs very sensitive about not being treated with the same respect that she feels Kate is, so can react badly and doesnapost take it lying down.

The slightest touch would make the spots bleed and she would scream in agony. “This meant she couldn’t eat or drink, resulting in weight loss and dehydration.” The first time mum took her poorly daughter to the doctor who prescribed Panadol, but it took three weeks for the agonising sores to finally clear up.  She added: “She was absolutely miserable and stuck to my hip for four days straight! Just attempting to put her down made her scream! We went to the Dr to get cream for the spots on her lip but it really was a waiting game for it to clear up. Around the clock Panadol was the only thing helping.

Lee Clark, who works in a branch of Tesco in Southend-on-Sea, says he will be giving the silent treatment to all customers and colleagues. Lee is usually noisy and chatty but his silence vow is for a very good cause. He is being sponsored to be silent while on sht to raise money for Cancer Research, British Heart Foundation, and Diabetes UK. The father-of-five started his silence at the beginning of January and will finish on April . Instead of speaking, Lee is communicating with flashcards, pens, and paper.Speaking to Manchester Evening News, Lee said: It could be quite draining because you try not to slip up and try to focus. It can be a horrible experience but, again, Iaposm lucky I can put myself in that position to help someone  and Iaposll happily do that every single time. Lee said that knowing he is doing something good for those charities gets him through it because it can be a very lonely place and can make him feel quite isolated. The Tesco worker has worked at the supermarket chain for  years, and this will be his th year doing a sponsored silence. He first decided to remain silent after being referred to as the singing man on the tills.  Lee raised £ for the Lennox Lewis Cancer Fund in that very first nine-hour silent sht. It was phenomenal because Iaposve never done anything like that in my le before, so it really got me. He said, It gave me the bug for fundraising as well. I just saw the response as well as the love and support it brought. Lee explained that people would come into his branch of Tesco to see him be silent and donate to the bucket, saying it was a brilliant experience. I saw the dference it makes to people and thataposs what I never experienced before. Youaposre helping someone and theyaposre helping you, there is no better feeling than that. He added: I love giving. Lee has participated and organised in over  charity events in the last  years, raising around £, for  dferent charities.  Tesco is very supportive of Leeaposs fundraising and supports his challenge on its social media s. He also believes it provides a sense of fun and laughter to his colleagues and shoppers. While working, Lee hangs a board around his neck to explain what he is doing and who he is raising money for. Itaposs my th one, so itaposs quite an achievement in that sense and no one gets bored of it. They love me being quiet.  But, some people think at first they heaposs being rude but quickly change their minds when they see the sign. Lee says this fundraising event is his worst one compared to others heaposs participated in because he gets frustrated that he canapost talk.  It is the worst thing in the world when you just want to blurt out and join in their conversation, he said. After his sht is over, he is happy to be able to speak because he loves talking. In addition to his sponsored silence, Lee will also be running the London Marathon and climbing Mount Kilimanjaro this year to raise money for charity. Anything you raise is something more than you had yesterday, so it doesnapost matter what you raise, Lee added.

Tens of thousands are still coming down with the virus every day and, just as Charles will hope he has not passed it on to the Queen, they too will worry about spreading it. So Boris Johnson must explain why he unilaterally decided to bring forward the end of all Covid restrictions. One member of SAGE has said they were blindsided by the decision even though it has implications for millions of people’s health. It is also noticeable that neither the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, nor the Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, have said whether they approve of the PM’s actions. People will rightly ask whether the Prime Minister is acting in the national interest or out of political expediency.  Fools rush in Everything must be done to prevent Russia from carrying out its threat to invade Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is playing a reckless and risky game by massing an estimated , Russian troops on the country’s border. The response from the West must be resolute and united. But there is a fine line between taking a firm stance against Russian aggression and inflaming an already delicate situation. Boris Johnson’s overblown rhetoric yesterday risked crossing that line. President Putin is deliberately testing the resolve of the West. Forcing him to back down requires careful and well-calibrated diplomacy, not cavalier comments and photo opportunities designed to distract attention from domestic troubles.

And as you can imagine being a pet of the Queen comes with serious perks as they lead lives that other dogs could only dream of. Hereaposs what their pampered lives entail... Menu of dishes It will come as no surprise that the Queenaposs dogs also have only the very best when it comes to their meal times.As well as meticulously checking what the royal household will be eating each week, the Queen also reportedly insists her beloved corgis have their own menus. Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. Former royal chef Darren McGrady said: They corgis have their own menu. One day theyaposll have lamb, one day beef and then another, chicken. We had to make sure that all the meat was cut very finely and diced so there were no bones because we couldnapost have them choking. Special gravy  If it sounds like the dogsapos food is quite dry fear not - they also have a special gravy that is poured on top of their food to make it even more delicious.And whataposs more, itaposs a special recipe that Her Majesty has created herself. In the book All The Queenaposs Corgis, author Penny Junor writes that the petsapos food is a iety of fresh, cooked meat, vegetables and rice, prepared specially for them in the royal kitchens, topped with a little biscuit, homoeopathic and herbal remedies when required, and a special gravy that, legend has it, is the Queenaposs own recipe. Feeding ritual  But youaposd be mistakenyou think the food is just put into bowls and the pets head in for a free-for-all. What actually happens at feeding time, is a strict ritual.Dr Roger Mugford, an animal psychologist who has worked for the royal household for decades, described witnessing the dogsapos dinner time at Buckingham Palace.He told Town and Country magazine: Their food was served by a butler in an eclectic collection of battered silver and porcelain dishes. As I watched, the Queen got the corgis to sit in a semi-circle around her, and then fed them one by one, in order of seniority. The others just sat and patiently waited their turn. While in her book, Penny Junor adds: Whenever possible, she [the Queen] feeds them herself and it is an afternoon ritual but not an unruly frantic free-for-all. A footman brings the food and bowls on a silver tray and lays out a plastic sheet to protect the carpet. The Queen then sits them in a semi-circle around her and does the rest.Travelling in style With the Queen having houses up and down the UK, she often has to travel with her dogs seemingly tagging along with her. But they donapost seem to be packed up in the back of a car. Charming snaps from over the years have shown the Queen sitting with the pets on her lap while in the car. In addition, the dogs have been a familiar sight at the likes of Aberdeen Airport, where the royals fly into on their way to the Balmoral estate in the Scottish Highlands.  Impressive sleeping quartersWhen it comes to bedtime, the Queenaposs dogs donapost just head to dog baskets in the kitchen - they actually have their own quarters.According to Hello!, when at Buckingham Palace, the dogs have their own spacious room where they sleep in raised wicker beds.In addition, the beds have fresh sheets put on them daily, which is said to be a tradition started by the Queen Mother.

The Monarch has been collecting stamps for decades and she now has an extremely impressive private collection with several that are worth a pretty penny.According to The , the Mauritian stamp is not only the most valuable in her collection but itaposs one of the most prized in the world and was valued at a staggering £ million back in .Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.Click here to sign up.It originally belonged to her grandfather King George V, who bought it at auction in  for £, at the time - equivalent to about £, today. The stamp went on display to the public in  as part of a travelling exhibition to celebrate the Queenaposs Golden Jubilee. Over the years, the Queen has built an impressive collection, which is said to fill about  albums and about  boxes, all stored in a vault at St Jamesaposs Palace. Queen Victoria’s second son, Prince Alfred, started the stamp collection in . He then sold it to his brother, the future King Edward VII, who in turn gave it to his son, King George V and it subsequently passed down to King George VI and finally to the Queen.  When the Queen took over the collection she decided to sell some of the surplus to requirement stamps at auction and used the cash to buy new additions.According to the , the pieces she sold were a huge hit with buyers back in  and her  items made £,.She spent £, of the profit on a unique set of  Penny Blacks.Royal expert Phil Dampier told The Sunthat she loves to show them off to visitors when they come to see her at Buckingham Palace.He said: The Queen loves showing her stamp collection to visitors, say heads of state who stay at Buckingham Palace.

Anna Birley said under Dickaposs watch, the Met Police was willing to put itself above the expense of womenaposs safety in refusing to tackle issues of misogyny and violence against women - along with wider issues of homophobia and racism. Commissioner Dickaposs resignation comes after the deaths of Sarah Everard, Sabina Nessa as well as sisters Nicole Smallman, , and Bibaa Henry, .Sarah Everard was kidnapped, raped and killed by Met Officer Wayne Couzens, while sisters Nicole and Bibaa were killed stabbed to death in north London by Danyal Hussein.  Koci Selamaj, , has accepted responsibility for Sabina Nessaaposs death, but denies murdering the -year-old. He is due to stand trial later this year.Following a public outcry for the Met Police to do more in protecting women, Cressida Dick was slammed for saying those who feel intimidated on the street should flag down a bus or pretend to FaceTime.Anna said: It was absolutely tone deaf - the idea that the answer to keeping ourselves safe is to flag down a bus, phone a friend or pretend to FaceTime is quite frankly offensive. Her unwillingness to recognise discrimination and call it out for what it is creates toxicity.You canapost fix somethingyou donapost accept and recognise thereaposs a problem. Speaking about the need for change within the force, Anna said: We are really pleased about this resignation. There is a rotten culture in the Met Police and one which puts itself at the expense of womenaposs safety. While one person leaving doesnapost fix this culture overnight, we have to hold our leadership accountable to a higher standard and we need a leader who can meet those standard. The past  months has shown this toxic culture in the Met. People of colour have always been affected by the way police treat them, but women in the last year have felt less safe.It was on Cressida Dickaposs watch that one of her officers used his position to abduct, rape and kill a woman. Lucy went on to say the police response to calls for more support for women was offensive. She added: Following this police then knocked womenaposs doors in my neighbourhood telling them they needed to take steps to stay safe. Any organisation that tells women they are part of problem rather than stepping up with the right support is an issue.Following Sarah Everardaposs death, Reclaim These Streets organised a vigil at Clapham Common where an inquiry later found officers used excessive force, antagonised protesters and misinterpreted coronavirus laws during their policing of the event. Anna continued: The way they policed the vigil showed a complete lack of understanding and highlighted these engrained issues. I am yet to meet a woman who feels safe when she leaves the house. We hold keys in between our fingers, we share locations, wear bright clothes. In March we had had enough. We are tired of the burden to stay safe being placed on our shoulders when what we need is to look at who is policing us and why itaposs not working.

Welsh actor and skincare influencerScott McGlynnlives with his partner Justin in Cardf, Wales, and the dog-obsessed pair have five pets together.They welcomed their first puppy within five months of meeting, and have given every dog a sentimental name to mark a dferent milestone in their relationship. Due to work commitments and a busy household, Scott and Justin have made the decision to stick with furry children - and wouldnapost have it any other way. “We couldn’t have a child right now and it’s not on our cards, but that’s okay,” Scott said.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Scott met Justin online  years ago, and they instantly spoke about getting a pet together. “Justin is a dog groomer and lives and breathes dogs, and I’ve always wanted one,” he explained. The pair named their first dog, a chihuahua toy poodle cross, after their first date. “She is called Belle after Bellini’s restaurant. I remember it was a really lovely night,” Scott said. When they got engaged a couple of years later, they saved the money they’d been given as gts and spent it on a second dog. Shih Tzu Cleo was named after their first car, a Renault Clio, to mark a “very proud moment”.  The duo have spent the last decade building their dog family, and have made the decision not to have children. It follows Pope Francisaposs comments that couples who prefer pets to children are selfish - which sparked a furious backlash. The leader of the world’s . billion Catholics previously claimed that substituting pets for children “takes away our humanity” - leaving people baffled at his tone-deaf remarks. “Our dogs are our absolute lives,” Scott said. “We’ve spoken about having kids and both decided that they just aren’t part of our plan. “We are very career-driven and I go away a lot with my job. Five dogs keep us very busy. I wouldn’t have it any other way.” Scott loves ing home to his wonderful family of furry friends, and enjoys being greeted at the door with jumping paws. “We like spending our Sundays on long walks with all the dogs,” he said.As well as Belle and Cleo, the pup-obsessed couple have Faith, Bridget and Buffy. Seven-year-old standard poodle Faith got her name from their favourite phrase “keep the faith”. And two-year-old toy poodle Bridget is named after their most-loved films, Bridget Jones and The Girls Next Door. The pair almost stopped at four dogs, but decided on a fth when a rare pure white poodle came up. “Buffy is our baby and she’s named after my favourite TV show, Buffy the Vampire,” Scott said. Scott says Buffy the Vampire “taught him everything about gay relationships, being sassy and not letting things bother him”. “Buffy is just like that!” he added. All five dogs get on really well, and look picture-perfect with their black and white coats. “I would never say never to a sixth dog,” Scott said. “Especially a red toy poodle to mix up the colour scheme.” Scott loves nothing more than having a “cwtsh every morning and evening” with his dogs on the sofa, and says Buffy is a “crazy puppy” but they’re “enjoying every moment”. “We love a walk and a power nap. It’s the best of both worlds,” he finished.Do you have a fun dog story to share  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsLove\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Donna Phillips complained after she was twice subjected to the aposoffensiveapos remark that her afro was the result of an electric shock. She was one of only two black employees at the construction company and also complained after a colleague used the N-word aposseven timesapos a work. Now, an employment tribunal has ruled the comments about her hair amounted to racial discrimination - stating the same comment aposwould not have been saidapos to a white employee. Miss Phillips, who sued London-based Ballymore Construction Services, is now in line to receive compensation.  The employment tribunal heard Miss Phillips began work at Ballymore in March  as a receptionist and administrator. Miss Phillips was one of two black employees on the site and the tribunal heard there were also two employees of Indian origin as well as several European employees Six months into her new job, Miss Phillips sent an email to bosses complaining about a racist remark made by Paul McStoley in July  and another offensive comment made by Moiz Zahid in August . A tribunal report said: The comments were similar and remarked about what electrical sockets Miss Phillips had touched to make her hair like that. Miss Phillips has an afro and the tribunal found these comments were made when she had her hair untied and open. In the same email Miss Phillips also complained to bosses about a Spanish employee, Isobel Perez, using the aposN-wordapos seven times in the context of asking her, aposI have heard it is wrong to use the N-wordapos.  The London South tribunal heard Miss Phillips advised bosses the team could benefit from aposersity trainingapos because of the incidents she had raised. She later sent another email to bosses, complaining her concerns were not being aposaddressed properlyapos and raising additional concerns such as aposbeing blamed for IT errorsapos and aposbeing accused of being aggressiveapos. She raised a grievance which was dismissed, apart from one aspect relating to one of the afro comments - which was deemed aposindirectly discriminatoryapos. Miss Phillips resigned in January  and won her claims of race discrimination relating to the remarks about her hair.  Employment Judge Omar Khalil said: The tribunal concluded that the comment was less favourable treatment of Miss Phillips because of her race compared with a hypothetical white employee. The [electrical sockets] comment, even as a joke and in the context of Mr McStoleyaposs own hair, would not have been said to a white employee. The remark was made because Miss Phillips was black and wearing her afro hair out. For the same reasons, Mr Moiz Zahidaposs comparable comment to that of Mr McStoleyaposs was also race discrimination. Miss Phillips received an apology from Mr Zahid, it was heard. Judge Khalil said Ms Perezaposs use of the N-word, although offensive, did not amount to discrimination. The judge said: In relation to Isobel Perezaposs use of the N-word, the tribunal was unanimous in its view that the word was an inappropriate and offensive term. However, the tribunal was not satisfied that Miss Phillipaposs description of the event and the repetitive use of the wordwas plausible. It was, in the tribunalaposs view, an inquisitive and perhaps naive enquiry from someone who spoke Spanish first, English second. Miss Phillips will be awarded compensation at a later date. Her other claims relating to race discrimination, direct sex discrimination, victimisation, sexual and racial harassment and disability discrimination all failed.

Angela, from Hampshire, admitted she never had a great relationship with food,” as she shared her weight loss transformation. She explained: “After the birth of my second child I fell very ill with leukaemia. My marriage broke down, I lost my hearing due to the cancer treatment, and I wasn’t able to do my job anymore.I was feeling low, and the weight crept on, my blood pressure was high, and I had a number of health issues. When I moved area with my children and new partner Phil, I made the decision to lose weight and start taking care of myself.“I tried to lose weight in the first lockdown, but I couldn’t do it on my own and I knew I needed the support of a group. This is when Angela decided to join Slimming World.She explained: “I was slightly nervous going to my first group and couldn’t believe it when I stood on the scales to find I was  stone . pounds. I cried when I realised my BMI was in the obese category. “Emma and the other members were so kind and welcoming, though, and they put me right at ease. From the moment I arrived, I felt no judgement, only acceptance. Going to group has been a lesaver for me, it has helped me to set goals, understand where I might trip up on my weight-loss journey, and put plans in place to make sure I continue to lose weight.Angela admitted that before starting her weight loss journey, she didn’t really pay attention to what she was eating. But now I really enjoy trying new Slimming World recipes, and I never feel hungry. I’ve been able to adapt Slimming World’s Food Optimising plan to create meals my family enjoy, and make healthy swaps, like using leaner meat and less oil. “For a long time I’ve been unable to even walk to the end of my road without getting out of breath, but with the support from my Slimming World group, I started introducing exercise slowly, and now I enjoy going swimming three to four times a week, and when I can’t go you’ll find me going for a long walk.  She continued: “I’m still on my weight-loss journey, but I’m so proud of how far I’ve come. I always wore leggings before with large, baggy tops as nothing  fitted me, now I’ve lost weight I enjoy trying on clothes and really think about what I want to wear. Slimming World has given me the confidence in myself to continue making healthy changes and choices, and the energy to do all the things I want to.” Emma Jones, from Slimming World group, said: “Angela has fully embraced Slimming World’s Food Optimising and physical activity Body Magic programmes and is doing incredibly well. She is such an inspiration to our group and I’m so proud of how far she’s come.” Diet before Breakfast: Toast and cakeLunch: Sandwich, crisps, a fizzy drink and chocolateDinner: Breaded chicken with ketchup served on a roll or with chipsSnacks: Cake, chocolate, ice cream and sugary sweetsDiet after Breakfast: Yoghurt and fruit or mushroom omeletteLunch: Baked potato with baked beans or saladDinner: Cajun chicken with lots of veg and riceSnacks: Fruit and cereal barsMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Slimming WorldDietFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

While many of us wouldnapost bat an eyelid and would be happy to welcome our friends and family to our wedding regardless of whether theyaposre pregnant, others see their baby bump as a warning sign, as guests may be tempted to fuss over them instead of keeping their attention on the bride and groom. The latter is the opinion of one -year-old woman on Reddit, who has actually banned her fiancéaposs own sister from attending their wedding because sheaposll be heavily pregnant at the time.Sharing her story anonymously, the woman explained her future sister-in-law, , is due to give birth two weeks after the wedding, and the bride doesnapost want her there as she believes she and her husband-to-be should be the focal point.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She said: My fiancé has a -year-old little sister who he is close to and whom I really do like. Iaposm very excited to be her older sister-in-law. She was going to be a guest at our wedding, however, a few days ago we found out she is pregnant and plans on having the baby. Now Iaposm not going to sit here and shame her for her irresponsible actions or anything, but I felt like this was a very big deal. She is apparently due two weeks after the wedding. My worry is this: pregnant women require a lot of care and extra accommodation. Thereaposs also the risk of her water breaking at my ceremony and taking all the attention off me on my day. Call me selfish but I feel that I and my husband to be should be the focal point.  I donapost want to risk her giving birth and needing even more attention that should be placed on me. So I think she shouldnapost be there. The woman told her fiancé, , she doesnapost want his sister at the wedding - and he accused her of being selfish. She added: I told my fiancé and he got unbelievably p***ed off at me. He told me I was being a complete a**hole by not inviting her since heaposs her little sister. I get that they are very close, but itaposs not a good idea. Attention aside, I donapost think a nine-month pregnant teen should be on her feet at a wedding so close to her due date. He told me I was backpedalling and I should be ashamed of myself. He then told his whole family and they all are mad at me for suggesting this. Commenters on Reddit canapost believe the womanaposs cheek, with many of them telling her she needs to be more supportive of her pregnant future sister-in-law. One person wrote: This is a girl who is likely to face a lot of ostracism and challenges already and you seem eager to be first in line to make things harder for her. Be careful, because you are showing some truecolours to your future husband and in-laws. While another added: You will ruin your relationship with her forever by not inviting her. By extension, you will damage your relationship with your future husband since they are close. Get over yourself. And a third said: This is someone who is very important to your fiancé.

For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. In the clip, Owen revealed his purchase and said: I waited ages and paid £ for these and I’ve texted and complained, they said they are going to sort it.” During the review, which has been viewed more than . million times, Owen first showed off his own teeth before putting in the bottom row of the pearly white set. He said: Bottom ones are actually sweet, nothing wrong with them.  However, it quickly goes downhill for Owen as he clips in the top set of teeth which pushes out his top lip and leaves him struggling to speak. Mortied at the result, he questioned: Are you going to tell me that these are normal  They are huge, I’ve got a f***ing overbite. In good humour, Owen gave a dashing smile that left the lad’s fluorescent white teeth touching below his bottom lip. Tickled by Owen’s set of ‘huge’ teeth, many people took to the comments to poke fun at the veneers. One person chuckled: Whose horse is that  Another user added: You could enter the Grand National with them… And someone  giggled: Mouthful of headstones.

Holidaymakers who witnessed the incident have told of how they thought they were going to die during the bizarre ruckus, which reportedly saw the mum and daughter lunge for the drive while on a bus trip during their TUI holiday to the Caribbean. The duo, who hailed from Essex, were said to have been smoking weed and eating rum cake prior to boarding the bus back to their hotel, in Montego Bay.Witnesses told the Sun Online that the pair became agitated to the point that they began to scream about being “kidnapped”.Adding fuel to the flames, the mum and daughter posted on social media during the meltdown, ly alleging they were being “sex trafficked”.The posts caught the attention of their followers and spread like wildfire on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.The daughter has since cleared up the “misunderstanding” with a post on Instagram stating the family is safe.  The episode was reportedly triggered by weed, which prompted the pair to become frantic and paranoid as the busload of British tourists were being ferried past Dunns Falls and Bob Marleyaposs house on the sun-soaked island. They attempted to grapple with the driver and pull the handbrake of the coach before leaping from the moving vehicle. The bus driver was later hailed as a “hero” by the family’s fellow tourists for keeping his cool during the -minute trip and getting most passengers to their destinations. The mum allegedly started to claim there was a plot to “kidnap” her and her daughter after the pair allegedly smoked a joint at the Bob Marley Museum at Nine Mile, the tour’s final stop. Chaos ensued, as the bus tried to navigate the winding trip back to Montenegro bay while the pair became increasingly erratic, and eventually convinced themselves other tourists on the bus were involved in the “plot”. One passenger, Darrell Smith told the Sun Online that he had turned to his we Jemma to say “I love you”, as he thought it might be “the last time [he] got to say it”. Darrell and Jemma had had a “fantastic day” with the tour group as they explored the countryside, Darrell said, but things had changed dramatically when they got back to the bus after visiting Nine Mile. The women became increasingly delusional and tried to force open the bus doors as it was still moving, he said, travelling at speeds of up to mph. Other passengers were forced to restrain the mum as she started screaming “stop the bus”, he said, while he grabbed the daughter as she jumped over the front seats and pulled up the handbrake. At one point, the mum opened the bus window and tried to leap out, but she instead bumped her head, causing a bloody gash to appear on her eye. Darrell suggested the weed had “triggered something”, while his we Jemma said she thought she was “going to die”. Jemma was now concerned about the story of kidnap still being out there on the internet - despite the fact, none of it had happened. The step mum and her daughter had reportedly been travelling with other members of their family, who were said to have tried to calm them down. Another passenger said it was “wrong that info like this gives Jamaica and their hotel a bad name when they did nothing but try to keep them safe. Another Brit tourist, who was staying at the same hotel as the family, said: They had some weed and rum cake and lost the plot. The family have since ed to the UK, as travel company TUI is reportedly investigating the incident. A spokesman said: We take reports of this nature seriously and have been in continued contact with the family and will continue to offer our full support.

Kyan Pennell died on January  when he got caught between a trailer and a gate at his family’s property in Tuchekoi, southeast of Gympie, Queensland.According toYahoo News , the family was left heartbroken.Kyan, who had a passion for classical music, was teaching himself classical piano in the months before his death - and unbeknownst to his parents, had started writing his own composition. Now, after finding an unfinished song in a blank notebook, his mother Amanda Bierley has started a campaign to bring his music to le ahead of his funeral - scheduled to take place on Sunday.She never got to hear his piece, but has appealed to musicians on Facebook to play what he has written and send the family a recording. In a post on Facebook, she said that Kyan was composing a piece which he had categorised as a “modern classical”. I never heard what he was composing. Is there anyone that can read music and play it and send it to us ” she asked. “It would mean the world to us to hear his composition. Kyan had wanted to be a concert pianist, Amanda said and had spent “every waking hour” on the piano he scraped and saved to buy. Speaking on BC radio, Amanda said the family was hoping the finished piece could offer “just a little insight” into Kyan’s mind. She said Kyan was “so much more than the way he died”, and said she wanted people to remember him for who he was in his short  years - “full of le, with a beautul mind”. In a tribute on Facebook, she said: He was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD and used that superpower to become an incredibly beautul and unique human who just wanted to learn and excel at everything he could, about everything there was.  Piano was his calling, he was , and had  months of learning, teaching himself music theory, performance and composition.” He had committed multiple classical pieces to memory, she said, as well as some modern pieces. However, she claimed he had only learned the modern pieces to lure in new listeners and educate them with the beauty of classical music. Amanda carried on to appeal for musicians to complete the music as Kyan had intended, with “repeated bits, a changed tempo and with light and shade”. He imagined it to be performed by wind and string instruments, and of course his beloved piano, she continued on Facebook. He would have been so chuffed that all these wonderful people are now playing his music. Little did he know he was actually composing his own funeral song.” Amanda’s Facebook post has attracted hundreds of responses and shares. The family have received some “lovely renditions”, Amanda said, but she continued to encourage anyone to contribute to his “beautul unfinished work” and hopes more come through before his funeral. She said she was “extremely humbled” by people’s responses, which had helped him see “beauty through adversity”. According to ABC reports, Kyan’s song would be performed and recorded by  members of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, with the aim of having it complete for Sunday’s funeral.Meanwhile, a GoFundMe campaign has been launched by a family friend to help the beautul Pennell family out during this dficult time.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ADHDAustralia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said: My first thought was aposmillionaires are not flashing their money on Tinder.. because they donapost need toapos. So I was curious to see what he was actually like.In keeping with his opulent tastes, she says suggested they meet outside a hotel on one of the most expensive streets in Munich, in an area filled with designer shops. They then walked to a restaurant to grab a coffee. It was at this point she started to develop a fuller impression of him. Valeria said: I remember we sat for five minutes and then he suggested we go to another place because he didnapost like the menu. Then I went to a fancy cigar store with him because he wanted to smoke one. After that we went into a mall, where we finally sat at a cafe, which seemed like an expensive place as well. She remembers Leviev as a talkative guy, but noted that he was more into talking about himself, remarking that it appeared he wanted to give the impression that he was mysterious. At one point, Valeria asked Leviev where he was from - but he refused to give her a straight answer. Other red flags started to emerge, including that he had two mobile phones and openly took a couple of bizarre calls while still on the date. She claims Leviev discussed million-dollar transactions on these calls, which she found. Who talks about money in front of a stranger , she asks. She added: It was also weird that he would talk about other girls, saying that they always sent him photos, he even showed me some. I wouldnapost trust someone who shows other girls private photos.  Their date lasted about an hour, and while she says there was nothing too concerning about their first meeting she couldnapost work him out. She said: I was still not surehe was genuine or not. But it wasnapost the last time she heard from the trickster, and claims he messaged her later that night inviting her a party at his Munich home. She said: It was already very late and I was in my pyjamas, so of course, I didnapost feel like going. We had a little conversation via WhatsApp but I really didnapost feel like going so he said something like aposI thought you were more spontaneous than thatapos.  Valeria first read DWaposs original article about aposThe Tinder Swindlerapos after somebody shared it on a Munich-related Facebook group. She instantly recognised the conman as the man sheaposd been on a date with, and was shocked by his behaviour.After finding out who Leviev really was beneath the flashy clothes and bravado, Valeria was naturally surprised, but then remembered that she knew there was something not so right about him. So everything made sense.She didnapost tune into the Netflix documentary immediately after its release, catching up with it for the very first time on Monday, February . She was already aware of the story and Levievaposs deceitful nature, but still couldnapost help but find it to be a shocking watch.Valeria said: I am shocked that many women would believe him, but my theory is that he had many tinder dates in a day and would carefully choose his victims because not everyone can fall for him. He was a professional. Leviev has released a statement following the Netflix show, which reads: “I will share my side of the story in the next few days, but I’ve sorted out the best and most respectful way to tell it both to the involved parties and myself. Until then, please keep an open mind and heart.”Have you got a shocking or interesting story to tell  We pay for stories.

Max Silvy, , was due to picked up by Alyssa Hodges after the pair met on dating app Tinder.After swiping right, they got to know each other but their blossoming romance was really tested when the -year-old went into labour. Max was totally unfazed and stayed by her side her through the birth of Ollie back in September last year. Alyssa was ready to meet the civil servant when her water broke at eight months - and she had to meet him in the hospital instead, where she gave birth with her date by her side.The couple say the unlikely circumstances of their relationship has aposbondedapos them as Max was supporting Alyssa during the early weeks of motherhood and now plan to move-in together. Although their families were initially apprehensive about the relationship developing at such an intense time, both sides have now given their blessings to the couple.Alyssa, from Brisbane, Australia, said: I was about six and a half months pregnant when I went on Tinder, and I clearly stated that on my bio. I didnapost want to lead anyone on, so I was being open and honest. I wanted them to know what they were getting into right off the bat.Max travels a lot for work so weaposd only seen each other three times before he ended up coming to my birth. On the day I went into labour, I was meant to be picking Max up from the airport as he was coming back from a work trip. That was the plan, but I ended up texting him saying aposIaposm so sorry, youaposll have to get a taxi. Iaposm going into labour.apos He hopped into a taxi when he got off the plane and came to the hospital and was there for me.  My mum was also there supporting me, but she had a holiday so she was here and there. Max was there for me through the whole labour and birth. The labour lasted on and off for about a week. Iaposd be sent home and come back into the hospital for a period of four to five days. I was contracting for those days and Max was with me the whole time. The birth itself was about seven hours. To help Alyssa find her feet, Max took time off work to be with her as she cared for her newborn. Alyssa said: He took the week off afterwards when I had no-one to help me look after Ollie. We both knew that we liked each other and had strong feelings for each other. But the birth was the peaking point of our relationship, it bonded us. Looking back, I know it was the best decision ever. Iaposm so glad he was there. Motherhood is a big adjustment for anybody, especially with me being younger. But Max taking a week off from work really helped. I had the baby blues. I was really upset and didnapost know what I was doing. I felt alone and Max carried me through that week. Every time I couldnapost do something, Max picked me up. Heaposs set me up to succeed in motherhood. Even though I knew I liked him at the time, anything could have happened. Iaposd just been in a relationship where I thought it would last, and it didnapost. So I did think aposWhatthis doesnapost work out apos, but it has and it was the best decision. I donapost regret it.For Max, Alyssaaposs pregnancy was not an issue to him, although he admits that being there for the birth made him aposanxiousapos.Max said: There was something that caught my eye about Alyssa. Normally I wouldnapost swipe right on a pregnant girl, but there was just something about her. I wouldnapost say the experience was overwhelming but I was anxious. I hadnapost prepared mentally the way Alyssa had, so coming in late [like I did] was a rapid process. Anxiety was the biggest thing. There were so many unknowns, so many things that I didnapost know about becoming a dad. Thereaposs a lot of learning that comes with being a new dad, but me and Ollie are bonding quite well. Since sharing their story on TikTok, Alyssa has been inundated with comments from women demanding to know how she found a man like Max. Alyssa said: On TikTok, everybody is askingMax has a brother, calling him aposman of the yearapos and saying we were the cutest little family. It was a great reaction.

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

What his example has meant for all of us we can only dimly comprehend.#Our respectful and affectionate sympathy in these days is constantly with our Royal Family.#To a new queen, so young, and yet so well equipped for the high duty to which she has been called, we pledge our loyal service in all the days to come.#My most memorable experience in a public le, extending to more than  years, was when I had the honour and privilege of a private conversation with his late Majesty King George VI.The occasion was when the Conveners of Counties and the Provosts of Burghs in the West of Scotland were presented to their Majesties in the Town Hall, Greenock, on July  .Princess Elizabeth, as she then was, Princess Margaret and the Duke of Edinburgh accompanied the King and Queen.After being presented to His Grace, the Duke of Montrose, I, in turn, introduced the Provosts and their wives of the six burghs in the County of Argyll.Shortly afterwards, I was summoned to His Majesty#s presence.The King immediately put me at ease by asking me to sit down and join him in a cup of tea. He then spoke to me of affairs of the county.To my delight, he displayed a wide and intimate knowledge of Argyll, a county for which he said he had a deep affection.He was keenly interested in all I told him.After about  minutes# conversation, I asked permission to withdraw but His Majesty said, #Do wait a little longer, please.#I came away with the feeling that I had left a gracious King, a great gentleman and, above all, a good and sincere man. His consideration, courtesy and kindliness, combined with his deep interest in the welfare of his people in Argyll impressed me to the full and are an indelible memory.Campbeltown Town Council resolved into a special public session during the committee meetings on Monday night to offer their respectful sympathy, devotion and loyalty to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, The Queen Mother and members of the Royal Family.Provost R Wallace Greenlees, who presided, rose to remind members of the Town Council of #the sorrowful time# through which the nation was passing and to ask them to approve of the following resolution:The resolution was unanimously carried.These addresses were duly sealed with the Common Seal of the Royal Burgh of Campbeltown and signed in name and on behalf of the Provost, Magistrates and Councillors by Provost R Wallace Greenlees and by Mr A I B Stewart, Town Clerk.Among the messages of condolence sent to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth were:The Lord Lieutenant has received the following acknowledgement from Her Majesty the Queen: #Am sincerely grateful for your message.

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"day-today-prestonpans-shut-due-covid-energy-price-rises","story":"Thanks from the East Lothian community have been shared across social media following the news that Day-Today – also know locally as Ashiq’s – is to close.A number of factors have contributed to owner Ferhan Ashiq’s decision to close his Redburn Road shop for good on February .Ferhan told the Courier that “the writing on the wall” came when Covid struck the county two years ago.This coincided with a serious burn injury to Ferhan and we Hira’s youngest son which put “stress on the business, with hours reduced to take care of him”.Additionally, Ferhan confirmed that the Day-Today store was also facing a huge surge in electric costs – a rise from £, per year to £, – which he said was an “insurmountable” price, putting the business in an “untenable situation”.He added: “With the costs of goods rising as it was, in good conscience could I really be asking the people of Prestonpans to be paying more for their products “I saw the writing on the wall – their own energy pricing will be going up and,anything, they will be needing to make their money go as far as possible, so we as a family decided we will leave before we are pushed.”Energy price rises for homes and businesses will continue after Ofgem announced that average energy bills will increase by £ from April – a rise of  per cent.Pandemic isolation rules put further pressure on staff and the Ashiq family.Ferhan added: “Running a store of that size is quite an undertaking: you end up working -hour days, seven days a week for three years, no holidays, no breaks.“Isolation measures put pressure on staff members covering other shts and working much harder.”Thanking the Prestonpans community, the shop owner said: “Our family is so thankful to everyone who helped us achieve what we have in Prestonpans for the last  years.“This business put myself and my sister through education and we both went to university off the back of it, and that could never have happenedthe community hadn’t shopped in our store.“I went to school with a lot of customers and I’m watching their kids grow up and become friends with my kids.”It has been confirmed that Day-Today has been sold and will “never be a convenience store again” – the new owner and business will not be revealed until March .The Ashiq family plans to stay in Prestonpans for the foreseeable future, while the family’s Levenhall Village Store in Musselburgh will remain open.Ferhan said: “I am looking to devote more time to my lovely we Hira, who has stood by me all these years throughout all the hardships, and my young children Harris, Niall and Daniel.”The alleged theft from the premises was reported to police, who are understood to be investigating the matter."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-leader-norman-hampshire-standing-re-election","story":"Norman Hampshire is Labour’s candidate for the Dunbar and East Linton ward in May’s East

Council to refuse planning permission for the flats, describing the new build as “over-dominant”.The proposal by Edinburgh-based BY Developments Ltd would see the bungalow on Gullane Main Street demolished and replaced by a passivhaus building containing four three-bedroom flats.In a letter to the local authority, the community council said that while it did not object to the idea of flats on the site, the current proposals were too big and it added that the design appeared to include windows which were just one metre from neighbouring houses, adding: “It is hard to imagine this providing adequate lighting.”The proposals to replace the house, known as Glen Maree, with the flats aims to make it as sustainable as possible, with its design statement describing the residential development as “net zero”.It will include electric car charging points at a private parking area to the rear of the property, solar  and non-fossil fuel heating systems.The roof design has been created to ensure maximum solar exposure to support the flats and the design statement points out that easy access to public transport is also available to new residents of the flats.It adds: “This development makes efficient use of land, buildings and infrastructure by altering a previously developed plot of land in a town centre rather than a greenfield site on the town periphery, for example.“Industry-leading Scottish cross laminated timber is to form the superstructure, whilst Passivhaus principals of airtightness, heat recovery and solar gain are to be employed to create very efficient, low-energy dwellings.“We believe this strategy will result in a very energy-efficient use of the plot, with the four new apartments using less energy than the existing building.“We intend to create an exemplar development that demonstrates sustainability without compromising design quality.”The design statement adds that the site itself is not in the Gullane Conservation Area but “on the periphery” of it.Despite plans to position the new building eight metres back from the Main Street pavement with a large front garden area, the community council said that the design did not fit the site.It said: “We have no issue with the general principle of creating flatted accommodation on the site.“The particular choice of design, creating four substantial flats across three floors rather than the two of the neighbouring houses, does appear to be over-dominant in scale.“Eventhe building were able to be set slightly further back this effect could be diminished, but the site appears not to lend itself to this.”The application is available to view on the council planning portal."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-gift-card-scheme-saw-sales-rocket-first-pandemic-christmas","story":"The East Lothian

struggle to compete with online giants and out-of-town shopping centres.“We have been involved with the East Lothian Gt Card scheme from the outset, as it was created specically to encourage customers to think locally.“This is very important to us, as we also live in Tranent and know that money spent locally stays in the community.”No figures are available for the current financial year yet

Self-deprecatory humour is one area where the audience enjoys the deliverer of such lines poking fun at their own person and behaviour.Les Dawson specialised in jokes about mothers-in law along with a iety of other harmless tropes which left his audience laughing innocently.Then there is the humour of cruelty where the comedian makes jokes which denigrate the objects of their humour and evoke laughter from such mockery, allowing the audience to enjoy their sense of superiority. Such humour has its followers and deserves to be identied as sick.Satire, which pokes fun at those who consider themselves of vital importance to the nation, is a vehicle intended to puncture the pomposity and the hypocrisies which betray the sense of self-importance of such personages. That type of humour is dangerous to the performers of this type of comedy where intolerance characterises the political regimes in power, but can thrive in liberal democracies.Today we have the comedians who are determined to push the boundaries to shock their audiences into laughing at the outrageous concepts contained therein and then feeling guilty for having done so. Jimmy Carr looks to that aspect of humour and concentrates his attention upon finding a way to make his audience laugh at remarks whichdelivered in print would shock and horry.His most recent joke about the victims of the Holocaustcomes into that category and he defends his schtick by saying it was no more than just a joke. To my mind he went beyond the boundaries so far that he entered the comedy of cruelty his target would then have allowed his audience to indulge their sense of superiority.The question which has to be asked is whether there is any subject which should be off-limits for comedians and remain taboo.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.HOUSING BOOM IN KILMARNOCKIT was disappointing to see the thoughtless conclusions drawn by your reporter from a Rightmove report that Kilmarnock has experienced the slowest rate of house-price growth in Scotland over the last  years . Even the headline to the article was misleading: there is a clear distinction between a house-price boom and a housing boom indeed a housing boom may explain why there is no house-price boom.Price tends to depend on the elementary principles of supply and demand and to conclude, solely on the basis there is no evidence of a signicant rise in house prices, that \"Killie is still not high up on the list of places Scots want to settle down in\" ignores the impact of increased supply. There has been extensive building of new developments in Kilmarnock over the last  years or so, with most of the nation’s leading house-builders involved.In March  Scottish Housing News reported that Taylor Wimpey alone was completing  years of continuous investment which had produced  new homes. When account is taken of the additional contributions from past and current developments by Persimmon, Barratt, Bellway, Miller Homes and others your readers might even reasonably conclude that Kilmarnock enjoys a prominent position in the list of places where peoplewish to settle down.Campbell Fullarton, Kilmarnock.* JUST to put the record right, Sir Alexander Fleming was born at Lochfield Farm, outside of Darvel in East Ayrshire, and not in Kilmarnock as your article suggests. Some more careful research would easily have revealed that fact.Ian Craig, Strathaven.CULTURE OF WIFELY INTERFERENCEI QUITE often like to re-read the cutting I have from The Herald Arts Magazine, dated October , . Yes, I know it is from a long time ago, but it provides some welcome escape from the perils surrounding us at present.Sorley MacLean, the teacher and scholar of Gaelic culture born in , was being celebrated, in that article in the magazine, by his son-in-law David Ross. It was penned with great tenderness and humour. Todays reading brought to light, more than usual, the words of the Chinese Professor Wang of Beijing, who while sitting in front of Sorleys great roaring fire at his home in Braes, Portree, opined, on the Cultural Revolution, that Chou en-laihad been \"the father of his people\" while Mao Tse-tunghad been \"the epoch-maker\". Unfortunately, we learn, that Mao \"had made some mistakes ... the Cultural Revolution for one, which had supported the old adage about not letting your we interfere with your business\".

Marty says: “I grew up in Carrbridge, just outside of Aviemore. My mum is a musician and I remember, growing up, there would be bands and musicians at the house every weekend and everyone having a jam. That gave me a base knowledge of music across a lot of dferent styles. I felt very lucky to have had that education.”Jamie had a similar experience. “My mum was responsible for getting me into music too. She played violin and piano and she encouraged me when I started playing the drums.“When I was a kid I used to pick my way through the family CD collection and find the gems. I didn’t know all the types of music but I knew what I liked. Growing up on the Isle of Skye, I began playing Scottish trad music, which is a massive part of the culture. Then in my teenage years I discovered house music on Radio One and that led me to the more electronic side of things.” Both moved to Glasgow and got to know each other while they were working at an indoor ski centre in the city. Marty had already started playing percussion on the Glasgow scene and Jamie was keen to start his own night. They teamed up to seethey could start a night that would find its niche and attract a crowd.“We didn’t start out as artists at all. We wanted to be promoters. Over the course of  years Shaka Loves You has evolved to become what it is now,” Jamie says.“It’s been amazing to find the scene for our music. That has been a springboard to expand the audience and what we want to do,” Marty adds.The pair have residencies at Buff Club and at Nice N Sleazy in Glasgow city centre. Multi-genre club nights are back to being among their core activities. “It goes back to the kind of music that was influencing us and not wanting to stay in one place, whether it be hip hop or house or funk.“There are so many tracks that I’d want to listen to on a night. There’s an endless pool of inspiration. I think that is exciting for the crowd,” Marty says.Jamie notes that a Glasgow crowd has a particular connection to their sound: “A Glasgow crowd doesn’t take itself too seriously. It’s a knowledgeable audience in terms of music and it will respond to what you play without limiting your options. They are more open to new tracks.”They hope toto the festival circuit this summer, Marty says, adding: “There are a few of dates in the diary already. I think a lot of events will still be rolling over tickets from two years ago so they might be rolling over line-ups too. We have to wait and seethere are any more that want us.”Craig Charles is an enthusiastic supporter and Jamie is grateful for the  this offers.“It started with Craig and the team at Radio  selecting our tracks to be played on air. We played a gig together in Edinburgh and we hit it off with him. That’s led to a few great shows together. The support he gives to good music and performers is fantastic.”www.shakalovesyou"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13467485.jpg?type=article-full","title":"austrian-covid-vaccine-mandate-dividing-nation","story":"Karoline Edtstadler, Minister for EU and Constitution, said politicians had a responsiblity to ensure that that healthcare system is still working and \"society, as a whole, can live normally.\"Around % of Austrians are fully vaccinated against Covid-.The Herald spoke to two families who are ided over the mandate.Katia Austerlitz, a social worker, lives in Vienna with her husband Klaus who is a journalist. \"The vaccination mandate is not too popular here.

That has been the job of Citizens Advice Scotland for the last  years while we have been the official advocate for postal consumers in Scotland. We have helped ensure the voice of Scottish postal consumers is represented, and any issues specic to Scotland are brought to the fore.I’ll admit when I first joined CAS my knowledge of postal issues wasn’t great. But it’s been amazing to be part of the ied work that CAS has undertaken to protect and enhance Scottish consumers’ access to postal services, and to effect change.We’ve worked on many dferent issues from: excessive parcel surcharging , access to post for vulnerable groups, access to post offices, what services consumers should expect under the universal postal service, post office outreach services, and many more. We’ve done this by commissioning research, engaging with the postal sector, and running campaigns.With a new body taking on this responsibility from April we’re reflecting on what we’ve achieved and the dference we’ve made.An issue that still remains today is parcel surcharging, where charges can be higher for consumers in parts of the Highlands and Islands compared to the rest of mainland Britain. We’ve worked with other stakeholders on this issue for a number of years. We’ve supported a compliance review of online retailers which resulted in enforcement notices being issued, highlighted this practice and our research in the Scottish and UK Parliaments, and supported campaigning alongside Citizens Advice Bureaux on the local impact of this issue.Affordability is another key issue, and this is even more important today as the cost of living hikes start to take effect. In  we achieved real progress on this when the cost of postal redirections was reduced for those on Universal Credit and eligibility widened. This was a great result, and we’ll continue to advocate for more affordable rates for those in challenging financial situations.Another great result was Ofcom agreeing to implement stronger protections for parcel customers so they are treated more fairly. The pandemic made post even more crucial so its vital no-one is left behind.Being able to afford post is one thing, but whatyou can’t even get post delivered to you  Unfortunately, this is still a reality for some vulnerable groups in Scotland and the impacts of this can be huge.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first.

Going to rarely visited places at the end of the earth, to see things only a few other people have ever seen.“It also helps I love penguins.”Melanie said that by sailing by expedition ship, they had the opportunity to explore remote parts of Antarctica on foot and from small zodiac boats, getting close to nature and the beautul wilderness.She added: #We are one of the very few passenger ships to get below the Antarctic Circle this season, so it was a privilege to spend three days down there.

When Bob and I got the opportunity to camp at Kerr Point ° south we just had to fly the flag proudly.”She added: #Only  guests had the opportunity to camp the night in Antarctica, so we were very lucky. Our camp neighbours were from Germany and asked us about the flag as they did not recognise it. We were very proud to explain where we came from and how new the flag is to the Isle of Skye.#I also work seasonally as an instructor at ACE Target Sports, Portree and we have photos of playing cards customers have won at ACE and taken with them around the world. I have taken a couple of ACE#S with me, taken photos and sent them back to Mattto add to the album! So, we are flying the flag for ACE as well.#Melanie and Bob are due to arrive back on Skye next Wednesday #All in all, an epic trip, never to be forgotten and full of amazing memories. Even the eye-wateringly cold Antarctic plunges we have both done down here!# she addedThe couple#s flying of the Skye standard will no doubt be a proud moment for young islander Calum Alasdair Munro from Kilmuir.

However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Read MoreRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NIEarlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years. While the wider population is looking forward to a e to normal, it is these very changes and relaxations that will force the clinically vulnerable to retreat even more from the world.Related topicsDepartment of HealthRobin SwannBoris JohnsonMore On Department of HealthNI health trusts short of almost  permanent consultants, according to BMA vacancy reportMore than , calls to Leline helpline in Northern Ireland last year, new figures reveal PremiumRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NICoronavirus Northern Ireland: What restrictions could be lted tomorrow There’s still a lot of work to be done to deal with mental health issues of young people in NI, says Koulla YiasoumaMost ReadKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centre‘Teebane is the forgotten atrocity’: Family call for public inquiry into IRA massacre of eight men‘It was so harrowing’ – priest who attended tragic car crash scene deeply moved by courage of -year-old boy#s familyLoyalist think tank says new research will challenge stereotypesTop VideosPlayHit TV show Bloodlands starring James Nesbitt begins filming season  in BangorPlayHas living under Covid restrictions changed our lives for the better PlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsLatest Northern IrelandBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsPSNI chief with arresting good looks inspires Valentine’s cardLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasUK and EU to continue ‘intensive talks’ on NI ProtocolJoris MinneOpinionCoco restaurant review: Where the works of art are on the plate and the wallsLatestWill Rowlands insists there is no panicking in the Wales campEddie Jones wants England to channel Muhammad Ali and dominate Italy in Rome‘No decision yet’ to ask Irish citizens to leave UkraineBoris Johnson receives legal questionnaire from partygate policeBoy stabbed to death at college in Milton Keynes,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

No charges have ever been brought.“We know that out of  suspects from the planning of the bomb to its execution, six weren’t even questioned by police. There are many issues we’d like addressed and I believe they merit a public inquiry.“At the very least, I think we deserve a fresh inquest as the original one, in our view, did not resolve some matters for us. The  HETreport left us with more questions than answers.”Ms Forrest’s brother David Harkness, a -year-old joiner, was killed with seven others.The eight men had left work at Lisanelly Army base in Omagh and were travelling in a Ford Transit van towards Cookstown when a roadside bomb exploded at Teebane crossroads on January , .!forfort[r].style.e.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][a]+\"px\"Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The company employing them, Karl Construction, was targeted because it carried out work for the security forces.Three weeks later, the UDA shot dead five men in Sean Graham’s bookies in the Lower Ormeau area of Belfast, alleging it was in retaliation for Teebane. The five Belfast murders were examined in a -page Police Ombudsman’s report published on Tuesday.Ms Forrest said: “I will never forget the Sean Graham’s shooting. It made me sick to the pit of my stomach that anyone would claim it had anything to do with us.“It wasn’t done in our name. We were in deep trauma at the time. We did not want anyone  to be put in that place. It’s something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy.“Neither our family, nor any of the Teebane families, wanted retaliation. I would love the opportunity to meet the Lower Ormeau families and tell them that personally.”Ms Forrest said she welcomed victims of any atrocity making progress in their campaign for justice and hoped that the Teebane families could also make advances.“Sometimes I feel like Teebane is the forgotten atrocity,” she said. “I can’t understand why. It was one of the biggest single losses of le in the Troubles.“Given that there have been no convictions, I am perplexed as to why there isn’t more clamour about it.“I feel we need to remind everybody that eight men were murdered — that they were eliminated because of the legitimate jobs they did.“It can be very hurtful when Teebane passes under the radar. It feels to us that our loved ones lives were less valuable than others’, that there is a hierarchy of victims in Northern Ireland.”Ms Forrest said that unionist politicians were not active enough in pursuing justice issues.“I look across the political ide, and I see Sinn Fein championing the Bloody Sunday, Ballymurphy and a whole range of other cases,” she said.“I think unionist politicians have let us down. They’re not out there calling for action on Teebane. Nobody seems to be fighting for us. I’m very disappointed that pressure isn’t being brought to bear in terms of our justice campaign.“Nobody seems to be doing the right thing by our family and the other Teebane families.”Ms Forrest said her brother had been working in Australia for two years, but he ed to Northern Ireland because their mother was seriously ill.“There was no Skype or Zoom in those days. We didn’t think mammy would make it. David wanted to see her so he came back.“Mammy lived and he didn’t. She always said, ‘God brought David home to die’.“After mammy recovered, he started saving up money to go back to Australia. It was hard to get work as a joiner. He took a job with Karl Construction. He kept that very much to himself but we knew he was working on the Army base in Omagh.”Seven men, including David, died outright. They were Gary Bleeks , Cecil Caldwell , Robert Dunseath , Richard McConnelland Nigel McKee . The van’s driver Oswald Gilchristdied in hospital four days later.Ms Forrest said her brother was the youngest of six in their family, and the only son.“We always used to joke that it would be a brave woman who came to take him away from all his sisters.“Little did we no there would never be the chance of that happening,” Ms Forrest said.“David was a lovely, decent hard-working country lad. He didn’t have a political bone in his body. We were brought up in a Christian home to love our neighbours and respect everybody. We never thought we had any enemies.“He was a joiner doing a day’s work —that shouldn’t have put a target on his back.”Most ReadFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centreKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rally‘Teebane is the forgotten atrocity’: Family call for public inquiry into IRA massacre of eight menLoyalist think tank says new research will challenge stereotypesPSNI chief Simon Byrne in the frame for Met job after Cressida Dick stands downTop VideosPlayHit TV show Bloodlands starring James Nesbitt begins filming season  in BangorPlayHas living under Covid restrictions changed our lives for the better PlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsLatest Northern IrelandBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsPSNI chief with arresting good looks inspires Valentine’s cardLatest Covid- case rates for UK local authority areasUK and EU to continue ‘intensive talks’ on NI ProtocolJoris MinneOpinionCoco restaurant review: Where the works of art are on the plate and the wallsLatestBBC NI presenters topping up pay packets with money-spinning external engagementsDrugs and cash seized by gardai in Co DublinPSNI chief with arresting good looks inspires Valentine’s cardKylie Jenner appears to reveal name of her newborn sonBritish journalist detained in Afghanistan released by Taliban,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up.

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it. He added: ldquoIrsquom pleased with the second half performance but certainly not with the first.Looking forward to his sidersquos next match, where they face a tough battle away to Meath, the Down boss said: ldquoWersquoll try to get more men back on the field and we will train hard over the next week to try and improve.ldquoYou canrsquot just sit off for  minutes and expect to still be in games.Down: G McMahon, P Fegan, F McElroy, B McArdle R McCormack, N McParland, D OrsquoHagan A Doherty, O Murdock C Mooney, L Kerr, C McCartanB OrsquoHagan , K McKernan, A Gilmore .Subs: C Poland for D OrsquoHagan, P Havern for K McKernan, J McCartan for C Mooney, C Francis for R McCormick, T Close for N McParland.Yellow Card: J McCartanGalway: C Flaherty K Molloy, S Kelly , S McGrath D McHugh, J Daly, C McDaid P Kelly, M Tierney O Gallagher , R Finnerty , F OrsquoLaoi S Walsh , P Conroy , T Culhane .Subs: D Comerfor R Finnerty, P Kelly for F OrsquoLaoi, T Gill for C McDaid, C Sweeney for T Culhane, D Conneely for P Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Poots.jpg","title":"Ministerial approval for  ambitious park proposal  ","story":"EXCITEMENT is building around the multi-million pound revamp of the stunningly picturesque Castlewellan Forest Park.Work is already underway on an ambitious scheme which will focus on a number of key areas as part of the major investment programme aimed at restoring the sprawling forest parkrsquos key heritage features to help maximise its tourism potential.The Heritage Lottery Fund has provided almost pound.m in assistance with the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand the EU weighing in with pound,.Construction work is well underway at the Bothy Yard in the forest park with other planned work including new landscape and drainage within The Grange courtyard, a new pedestrian path from the entrance gates to the main car park an a new vehicular road off Castle Avenue to the existing car park.There will also be a new traffic control barrier at Castle Avenue and caravan spaces will be relocated with the feature entrance gates at the Castle Avenue entrance restored, alongside the restoration of The Grange courtyard buildings and the reconstruction of a derelict building block.Funding from the government department and Newry, Mourne and Down Council is financing the restoration of the iconic th century greenhouse, reconstruction of the propagation house and cold frames.

This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13467956.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Winsberg, , who has  years of clinical practice and spent three years as the onsite psychiatrist at the Facebook Wellness Center, found herself single when her -year marriage ended in orce. She started to explore Bumble, Tinder and Hinge, and says: “In using dating apps, I began to joke that I could make a psychiatric diagnosis in less than  texts.”Sting through texts to find golden nuggets of information, her experience in psychiatry helped her see the people she engaged with on dating apps clearly – often after exchanging just a few messages.“I’ve met a lot of interesting people through dating apps, and have made some dear friends as well as quite a few romantic partners. I’ve had quite an adventure. But one needs to check one’s expectations, which are inversely proportional to the happiness that we derive from these tools,” she advises. “Take a fun and relaxed approach to it, and don’t think you’re going to meet the love of your le.”The book attempts to identy specic personalities through the language of texts, empowering people to read between the lines to find outyour potential partner is suitable dating material.In the book, she explores the ‘big five’ personality types, using the acronym OCEAN – Openness to experience Conscientiousness Extroversion Agreeableness Neuroticism. These can tell you a lot about how compatible you may be with your date, she says – and it can be identied through their language.“Take time to understand what personality type might be right for you.” An extrovert, for example, might give you a better social le, but pay you less attention at a party, because they are going to be off talking to other people.”How to spot a liar“There are telltale signs of lying over text, such as dropping the first person pronoun,” Winsberg says. “When we tell a lie, we tend to distance ourselves from the statement. Instead of saying ‘I’m running late’, you might text: ‘Running late’.“You may also speak in a repetitive way. Liars tend to say the same thing over and over again, hoping that makes it seem more true. It might be repeating the same thing three times about how the car broke down.”Red flags“In terms of text clues, we can start to see red flags when there’s an imbalance in the way people are texting each other. Is there a level playing field  What’s the pace at which people are replying to each other  Is somebody leaving you hanging for a really long time before responding, which doesn’t fit with the way you’ve been texting them “It says there’s a mismatch in either expectation or the power gradient. Who is holding the reins in the text message ”Too much information“A notion of intimacy, too much information too soon, or trying to develop too close a relationship before the relationship has had a chance to progress, can be a red flag of insecure attachment, and a neediness in their approach.”Rushing into a relationship without a strong foundation rarely lends itself to stability, and instant infatuation is likely to disappoint, she observes.Too little emotionA text exchange with no emotion could be a red flag, she notes. If the texts are flat, with no smiling in the language and little energy, this might be an indication the date is emotionally aloof.Control issuesSome people manage the anxiety of attachment by trying to control their environment, Winsberg points out. This could be an early text displaying the desire to control or a lack of flexibility – such as presuming you’ll want to meet them without asking first.Language chemistry“How well does your own language match with theirs  Is there chemistry in the language ” asks Winsberg – saying how well your humour styles match might be an indication of compatibility.Exclamation marks and ellipsesExclamation marks have an “anxious, excitable, ‘pay attention to me’ quality”, says Winsberg.“Exclamations tend to be more of a neurotic feature. People who use the ellipsisfrequently are likely to be more flirty and have more innuendo in their language. There may be less certainty involved in a relationship with a person who is using a lot of ellipses.”It’s only words“An extrovert will use the word ‘mouth’ more often, along with ‘drinks’, ‘other’, ‘restaurant’ and ‘dancing’. Those high in neuroticism, in contrast, are drawn to using the words ‘awful’, ‘though’, ‘lazy’, and ‘depressing’,” she says.“Extroverts are more likely to use the thumbs up emoji and the winking face emoji, and are less likely to use the exaggerated emojis – like the tired face or the eye-rolling face.“The masters of long-term relationships, those high in the agreeable dimension, will use the words ‘wonderful’, ‘together’, ‘morning’, and ‘spring’ with greater frequency,” she explains in the book. “Those extremely conscientious types will pepper their language with ‘completed’, ‘stupid’, ‘boring’ and ‘adventure’.“A person high in conscientiousness is likely to follow through on what they say they will do, or be a little bit more responsible. They may be a more stable relationship partner,” she continues.Colons correlate with conscientiousness, perhaps because they can be found in organised lists. “People who use expressions like ‘could’ve’, ‘should’ve’ are lower on the conscientiousness scale, so when you see a discrepancy between intent and outcome in language, that will betray a lower conscientiousness.”What he wants, what she wants“In general, men prefer shorter messages. One study showed in the course of a relationship,there’s a lot of texting happening, women tend to think, ‘Oh good, we’re getting along well’,” says Winsberg – whereas “research found men tend to find longer messages a bit scary initially, and see less communication as a sign of health in a relationship”.Deal-breakers“Everyone has their deal-breakers. It may be one person really doesn’t want to be with anyone who has addiction issues. Another is infidelity. There isn’t a unorm red flag for everybody.“Without directly asking someonethey’re an alcoholic orthey’re going to cheat on you, how do you bring up issues that may be sensitive for you ”Winsberg’s advice is to: “Introduce the subject and elicit their formed opinions about it”, asking “open-ended questions and seeing what emerges”.Green flags“Green flag indications include a similar style of humour, language style matching, the cadence between theand frequency of the text messages, and the timing of them.”*Speaking In Thumbs by Mimi Winsberg is published by Bluebird Books, priced £..

The star has toured the US, performed at the Grand Ole Opry, Carnegie Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and at WembleyHow does Philly, as she prefers to be known, explain this phenomenon “I think it’s about the emotions in these songs,” she says, still sharp as a pin as she approaches . “Everyone has been through these emotions and so everyone can relate to these songs. “And they all have great stories too, so it’s not just the melody but the lyrics that people connect with too.Philomena and The Rambling Men in the s while on tour. Philly, as she prefers to be known, was always happy to be \"one of the lads\"“Plus these are songs you can dance to and who doesn’t enjoy a dance ”After leaving Pomeroy Primary, like many of her generation Begley was sent out to work aged , and spent seven years working alongside other women and men in a hat factory in Cookstown where she remembers “maximum craic” and singing as she worked: “I would start a tune and then the whole place would join in,” she laughs. “I would say I got my education in le there, really, instead of secondary school.”Then one night at a local dance hall, aged , somebody asked her up on stage to sing a song for a dare and just like that, in an instant, she and others realised that a star was born,and having just celebrated  years performing at the Country Music Awards last week alongside Susan McCann, Derek Ryan, her niece Andrea Begley , alongside a host of other local country stars young and old, she is looking back on it all with an immense sense of gratitude: ”I just feel so lucky to have been able to spend so many years singing songs I love and entertaining people. Performing is the best tonic in the world bar none, because as soon as the music starts and you step up to the microphone, you forget all your troubles, worries and cares and are just in that moment of connection with the audience in front of you.“Performing, singing, none of it has ever felt like work to me because I love it so much and have made so many friends along the way.”STILL GOT IT: Philomena performing at the recent Country Music Awards where she was honoured for having clocked up a remarkable  years in the businessAll those years ago when she first stepped timorously on stage, the crowd was mesmerised andshe was soon a member of the popular Old Cross Ceili Band, which then became known as the Old Cross Bandshowand the group released three records between  and . In September , the band changed its name to The Country Flavour and Begley’s first record became her first chart hit when Here Today, Gone Tomorrow reached number seven in the Irish charts. This was swtly followed by her debut album Truck Driving Woman .In , she formed the Ramblin’ Men and Philomena felt very happy to be the only gal on tour with a group of men,enjoying the banter, and feeling “just like one of the lads really”.\u2028Begley regularly toured with Ray Lynam from  and they recorded many duets together, probably their most popular being My Elusive Dreams, which went on to be mentioned in The Pogues’ song, A Pair of Brown Eyes.\u2028In , Philomena, a mum-of-three and a proud grandmother who loves to bake soda bread, when she has the time, and lockdown gave her more of that than she would have liked, most famously had a hit with her version of Billie Jo Spears’ song Blanket on the Ground which went all the way to number five in the Irish charts, and she went on to befriend the American star, to tour with her and form a great friendship that lasted many years.“Bille had such a sense of fun and I adored being on stage with her when we toured together. I was gutted when she passed away after the last tour we did together in . But I’ve been lucky that I’ve toured the US and Europe and like every country singer alive I was delighted to be invited to sing at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville by Porter Wagoner all the way back in , and that allowed me to rub shoulders with the cream of Music City.”‘WHEN PHILOMENA SINGS YOU BELIEVE HER...SHE HAS EXPERIENCED ALL THE EMOTIONS SHE EXPRESSES’Philomena’s star was seriously on the ascent from  onwards when she made her debut at the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville at the behest of Porter Wagoner, and the opportunity allowed her to both meet and work with a litany of the biggest names in American country music.“Billie Jo [Spears was dear to me, but I loved Tammy Wynette too and have distinct memories of being in her house. I’ve worked with Charlie Pride, I’ve met George Jones, Merle Haggard, Emmy-Lou Harris, Buck Owen, all those stars of my generation who I looked up to , so many of whom are now dead, and so many others thatyou asked me who I loved most, I just couldn’t say because to me in country music all the artists are like one big family and it’s a family I’ve been so lucky to have spent my le being a part of.”Since storming Nashville in the late s - every country singer knows they have fully arrived when they tread the boards of the Opry - Begley frequently ed to Music City throughout her career and has toured the US and Europe frequently.Standout career moments for her include being a guest of honour at the infamously extravagant St Patrick’s Day parade in New York City, performing at Carnegie Hall, the Royal Albert Hall and a packed-out Wembley alongside other American country stars. One of Begley’s biggest pals and fans, to this very day, is contemporary Irish country star Daniel O’Donnell, who once said of her with real affection: “When Philomena sings a song you believe her... You feel that she’s experienced every emotion she expresses.”Philomena laughs at this compliment, as though to shrug it off, with that typical Northern Irish reticence before praise: “Daniel used to come to see me perform when he was a wee boy, say eight or nine, and to this day we are great friends and we’re both very supportive of each other’s careers. More than that Daniel is just the loveliest man, but I have so many friends who are country singers that I don’t want to single anyone out in case I start I row because I love so many of them, certainly everyone I’ve worked with and know personally, and while I am certainly not averse to listening to other kinds of music - I do like pop now and again and especially Adele - but I cannot stand that ‘head banger’ stuff, I think it’s fair to say that I will always be country in my heart and soul.”The vinyl for Philomena Begleys Country album released circa . Back then big hair and tight curls were very much in vogueThere’sanauthenticity, a salt-of-the-earth quality, to the Queen of the Silver Dollar, Ulster’s Queen of Country in fact, that nobody could deny.‘WHY I’D NEVER RETIRE FROM COUNTRY MUSIC IN A MILLION YEARS’Philomena is adamant that she would “never in a million years think about retiring” from performing the musical career she loves so much, even now at the venerable age of , with an astonishing  years of gigging, recording and touring behind her that has taken her all over the world, from the small village of Pomeroy all the way to the Grand Ole Opry and beyond.“So long as I have my health and am on my feet I intend to keep going,” she said, having realised during the imposed quietude and stasis of lockdown that “there is nothing worse than sitting on a couch doing nothing at home and not being able to get out. “I found lockdown unbearable really, because even all throughout the Troubles I was touring and performing and those were dark times. It’s just not in my nature to be content sitting at home because the buzz I get from singing in front of an audience is second to none.”Reflecting on her own le in country music, Philomena says: “When I look back on my career I can honestly say that I loved every minute of every hour of it, and the craic was ninety!”Philomena started her formal singing career on May , , supporting the Old Cross Ceili Band in Ardboe Hall, Co Tyrone.In her autobiography she reflected on how the predominant Catholic orthodoxy of the s when she first started touring meant certain songs, considered too risqué, were debarred from set lists. So when they weren’t allowed to perform the American country music songs of the era, her band neatly converted them into old-time waltzes. “The Catholic clergy prohibited us from bringing anything new into our traditional Irish sets,” she said. “In those days, you would have been excommunicatedyou broke the rules in the ceili halls, so we didn’t dare upset anyone. We knew the Church’s rules were not to be broken.“You’d also see the priest walking up through the crowd making sure that couples didn’t get too close during the slow dances. “So, it was the parish carnivals, rather then the ceili halls, that became our testing ground for these new country sounds.”Philomena, who will perhaps always be best known for Blanket on the Ground and Queen of the Silver Dollar, and who adores the music of George Jones and Patsy Cline particularly, is now looking forward to embarking on a new tour celebrating  years in the business.Catch Philomena Begley at the Burnavon, Cookstown on March  and look out for her new single We Believe In Happy Endings which she has recorded with her son Aidan Quinn and is set to be released soon.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityBut, while the overall picture in regards to the potentially deadly virus is improving, a senior Welsh Government minister has issued a stark reminder that the virus remains at large in the community.Speaking at a government press conference instead of first minister Mark Drakeford – who is himself isolating having tested positive for covid - economy minister Vaughan Gething provided the nation with the latest rule changes.However, while he confirmed that the main omicron wave has passed, he also revealed that a sub iant of omicron, the BA. omicron iant, has been found in Wales.The minister revealed that as of today - Friday, February  -  cases of this iant, which is said to be an even more transmissible form of omicron, have been identied across Wales.And it is this particular sub iant which is thought to be the primary reason why Northern Ireland is currently seeing a much higher percentage of positive covid cases relative to its population size, than the other UK nations.Fortunately, while more transmissible, it is thought that omicron is a less severe strain of covid than previous waves, and as such, Wales is continuing with plans to scrap many restrictions which are currently in place – albeit not as drastically as England are slashing their measures at this time.What was said about the sub iant Mr Gething said: “Cases of this even more transmissible form of omicron have been identied in all parts of the UK, and to date, there have been  cases here in Wales.“We will of course continue to keep a very close eye on this emerging development.“The pandemic pressures on our hospitals remain constant.“There are just under , covid- related patients in hospitalat the moment.“And there are  people with covid- in intensive care.“Sickness and absence rates across the NHS have fallen from the peak last month but, workforce issues continue to have an impact on our health services, contributing to wider winter pressures.”.removeWhat are the latest rule changes coming into force From Friday, February , Covid passes will no longer be required to enter venues such as nightclubs, theatres and concert halls  in Wales – although inidual venues and events can continue to ask for themthey wish.What’s more, while face coverings will still be required for now, they will no longer be mandatory in indoor public places – apart from retail, public transport and health and care settings - from Monday, February .From there,the public health conditions continue to improve, the legal requirement to wear face coverings in all remaining settings could be lted by the end of March. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCardf International Business Park would be built on farmland east of Cardf Airport in the Vale of Glamorgan.But the plans have attracted heavy criticism from campaigners and politicians fearing the impact on the environment of “concreting over” a working farm.Now Legal and General, the developer behind the scheme, has said the business park would create , jobs and attract £ million investment, boosting the local economy.Andrew McPhillips, Legal and General’s development director of strategic land and major projects, said: “This is a key project for Wales and we know it is important that we continue to communicate our plans to key stakeholders, the community and future partners.“Wales must be open for business for those who want to invest and consider investment in its future global economic development. The land has been allocated for planning within the enterprise zone for a number of years.”As well as building the -hectare business park, the plans involve giving  hectares of farmland to Vale of Glamorgan council, to massively extend the neighbouring Porthkerry Country Park. A corridor of land along Porthkerry Road would also be kept safeguarded, connecting the nearby railway line with Cardf Airport for a potential new train or tram service there.Mr McPhillips said: “We have already agreed the transfer of  hectares of land to the Vale of Glamorgan Council to form an extension to Porthkerry Country Park, for use by the community with added funding for environmental management.“This transfer will provide more public access with connection to the Wales Coastal Path, and access on foot from Porthkerry and Rhoose. From an environmental perspective, this transfer goes beyond mitigation and provides signicant bioersity net gain. There would also be . hectares of green space within the business park.”.removeThe business park would be built on Model Farm, off Port Road, which has been farmed by the Jenkins family for four generations. The family previously said they were “devastated” that they would have to leave the farm, but are hoping to continue their wildflower seed business.Legal and General bought the farm several years ago, and it was earmarked for a major building project in , as part of Vale of Glamorgan council’s local development plan. The site is also in one of eight enterprise zones in Wales, where the Welsh Government is focusing economic development and encouraging businesses to invest.Last summer the Vale council’s planning committee voted to grant permission for the business park at Model Farm. Campaigners then successfully applied for a judicial review, leading to the permission getting quashed. Now, another planning application has been sent to the council, and a public consultation on the plans is running until February .Then in the next few months, councillors on the planning committee will again be asked to vote on whether to approve permission for the business park. The last vote was split along party lines, with nine councillors voting in favour and eight against. With the upcoming local election in May, the political makeup of the committee could change, affecting the next vote.But in the meantime, Legal and General has released new estimates of how Cardf International Business Park could boost the local economy. With overall floorspace of the development covering , square metres, it’s expected the business park could provide space for , full-time employees.Gross value added, which measures local economic output, is expected to be a total of £ million, comprising £ million when the business park is operational and £ million during construction. Building the business park is expected to last a decade, creating  jobs.However, Maxine Levett, a campaigner with Vale Communities Unite, said several questions regarding the plans remain unanswered. She added the business park would be “detrimental” to the community and environment, and was unnecessary with several vacant brownfield sites nearby.She said: “This is a working farm helping feed the community and encouraging bioersity, when the Vale council has declared a climate emergency. The current land available at the Bro St Athans site shows there isn’t a requirement for this type of development, as there are thousands of square metres of brownfield sites waiting to be scooped up.“Who will finance the road works to accommodate the impact of potentially , extra vehicles from this site, on top of additional transport needs from recent residential buildings and the proposed development of Aberthaw power station “Bristol Airport has declared they are increasing their passengers to  million a year. This will greatly impact companies willing to fly out of Cardf Airport. And where is the funding coming from to provide a rail link to a planned transport hub “We will continue to fight this development as we feel it to be detrimental to the community, environment and unnecessary with Aberthaw, St Athan and other locations near to the M corridor better placed to meet employment needs, rather than a working farm.”Contrary to the views of campaigners and some local politicians, Legal and General has claimed it would preserve and enhance the environment. Plans include three kilometres of new hedgerows, and planting five acres of scrub and woodland, as well as extending Porthkerry Country Park.Mr McPhillips said: “Legal and General has been committed to Wales as a progressive investor and substantial employer for many years. This is a project which will increase economic growth and we will continue to pursue the planning viability sensitively with existing stakeholders.“Creating , jobs and investment of £ million must be seen as essential for the future of the Welsh economy, especially next to Cardf Airport. This investment in business infrastructure by Legal and General enhances the Welsh Government’s current major investment in Cardf Airport, a strategic gateway to facilitate international connectivity.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

INBT-ACThe court in  heard the defendant had “painted ‘KKK’ on a foreign national’s property”.The prosecutor added: “It was a vacant property. A foreign national was due to move into that property the following day. The matter is being prosecuted as being aggravated by hostility.”A defence barrister told the  court the defendant believed he was being “brain-washed by the amount of social media that he was consuming at the time and he was accepting at face value a lot of anti-immigration and similar types of posts.“That then led him to carry out the offence because he feared the house next door was going to become a multi-occupancy address and that there may be foreign nationals moving into the area.“That fear was baseless in that there was no suggestion that anything had happened to him that would give him reasonable cause for concern.“It simply was a consumption of negative social media views which then manested itself in a stupid decision by Mr Boyd to paint this on an empty house next door.“It is not a very sensible thing for Mr Boyd to have done. Thankfully, there was no one in the address that had to move out as a result of his actions but certainly there may have been a delay to the use of the property by the Housing Executive.”In , District Judge Nigel Broderick told Boyd: “This is a very serious incident, I have seen the photographs and you have painted this house with very gratuitous remarks and I’m satisfied that the offence is aggravated by virtue of hostility”.Ballymena Court has now heard the defendant was alleged to have breached the Community Service Order by failing to complete the  hours of unpaid work he had been ordered to do.A defence solicitor recently said he understood  hours were still be completed.The case had then been adjourned to February  when the defence lawyer said a further  hours had been completed since the last court date.The solicitor said a Probation Officer was seeking a further adjournment for the Community Service to be completed.The defence solicitor said the defendant has ten children and the background to the Community Service not being completed on time was “a series of illnesses with the children”.The solicitor said Boyd “tells me he actually very much enjoys going to the Community Service”.Judge Broderick adjourned the case to February .Read More Read MoreRead more:Ballymena  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from
