He says he wants to level up, because talent is distribute across the county, but opportunity is not. He says the challenge now is to turn jabs, jabs, jabs into jobs, jobs, jobs.But overall the Queen’s speech shows the government does not understand what went wrong in the last decade, he says. It is “a chance that has been squandered”.The plans for compulsory voter ID will suppress turnout, and disproportionately affect people from ethnic minorities, he says.And he says the plans in the Queen’s speech will not do anything to address violent crime, which has doubled since 2015. Starmer says he drafted his own bill to help victims six years ago. The government should adopt it, he says.And he says the failure to have a plan for adult social care is “unforgivable”. He says it is 657 days since Boris Johnson stood outside No 10 and said he had a plan for social care. Failure to act on this after the pandemic is “nothing short of an insult to the whole nation”.This is a seminal moment, he says. Even before the pandemic, Britain needed transformational change. He says there were 5.7 million people in low-paid or insecure work, and 4.2 million children in poverty. And life expectancy stalled for the first time in century. That is the record of 10 years of Conservative government, he says. He says the pandemic has shown that if you live in low-quality, overcrowded housing, the pandemic will have been harder for you than for others. So we needed a transformational Queen’s speech, he says. Instead it merely “papers over the cracks, with short-term gimmicks”, he says. He says there should have been a plan for jobs - like Joe Biden’s in the US.As is usual, he starts with tributes to the two backbenchers who opened the debate.These days, she says, when Boris Johnson goes on about Homer, Tory MPs are more likely to think Simpson, she says, than the classics.

Youngkin defeated state Senator Amanda Chase, who tried to win the primary by embracing Trump and his false claims of widespread fraud in the presidential election. Youngkin did not go to the same lengths that Chase did to align himself with Trump, but he spoke favorably of the former president and made “election integrity” a top focus of his campaign. Republicans hope that Youngkin’s status as a political outsider will allow them to win the Virginia governor’s mansion for the first time since 2009.

Fauci has previously clashed with one member of the committee, Republican Rand Paul, and Paul seemed to indicate yesterday that he was planning for another confrontation at the hearing. Joe Biden has picked former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel to be his ambassador to Japan. The selection ends months of speculation over whether Barack Obama’s first chief of staff, a former congressman and longtime Democratic operative, would be nominated to an administration role. In the first days of the Biden presidency Emanuel, 61, was mentioned as a possible secretary of transportation. Biden ended up picking Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who ran strongly in the Democratic presidential primary. Some progressives view Emanuel as a major antagonist within the party. He is often criticized among liberals, for example, for his handling of a shooting of an African American teenager during his time in Chicago. Emanuel served two terms as mayor but opted not to run a third time, in the face of a potentially brutal campaign. His selection as ambassador was first reported by the Financial Times.  confirmed it on Tuesday. “That’s one million more Americans who now have the peace of mind that comes from having health insurance,” the president said in a statement released this morning. “One million more Americans who don’t have to lie awake at night worrying about what happens if they or one of their family members gets sick. Through this opportunity for special enrollment, we have made enormous progress in expanding access to health insurance.” Biden encouraged Americans who still do not have health insurance coverage to sign up before the special enrollment period ends on August 15. The president also argued that the interest in the special enrollment period demonstrated the need to make the premium reductions included in his coronavirus relief package permanent by passing his American Families Plan. “Today’s milestone demonstrates that there is a need and a demand for high quality, affordable health insurance across this country,” Biden said. “It is up to Congress to hear them, and act quickly to pass the American Families Plan.”While congressional Democrats hope to make dramatic changes to a controversial legislative tool that has stalled bills in the Senate and could be used to frustrate Joe Biden’s ambitious agenda, Republicans are mounting an all-out defense to protect it. Conservative outside groups have been organizing overtly and covertly to counter Democratic pressure to gut the filibuster – a Senate device that in effect allows the minority party to halt proposed legislation. While Democrats have been struggling to unite members of their Senate caucus, especially the more centrist holdouts, to get rid of the filibuster, their Republican counterparts have been lockstep in opposing changes. Meanwhile, Republican outside groups have churned out polling, aired ads, organized gatherings and released statements warning of the long-term consequences of changing the rule. It is a concerted program that Republicans see as vital to preserving their power in the Biden era, while Democrats see it as a potential threat to their attempts to bring in meaningful legislation. The cause has reunited Republicans after the isiveness of the Trump era – bringing together business interests, Trumpist politicians and their anti-Trump opponents in the party, as well traditional big donors to conservative causes. Joe Biden will hold a virtual meeting with a bipartisan group of governors today, as the president pushes Congress to pass his infrastructure plan. The meeting comes as Democrats and Republicans continue to clash over the specifics of Biden’s proposal, particularly how to pay for the $2.3 trillion package. Over the weekend, Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell seemed to indicate he was willing to go slightly higher on the overall cost of the package, but he remains adamantly opposed to rolling back Trump-era tax cuts to help pay for it. And McConnell’s top-line price of $800 billion is still probably not enough for Democrats. “The president’s red lines are inaction and are anything that would raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year,” Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said yesterday.  She added, “There is agreement about the need to modernize our infrastructure, about the need to do more to create jobs in the economy. And he’s looking forward to hearing what additional ideas they may have.” Biden may hear some of those ideas from Republican governors this afternoon.

It has gathered far more doubters than believers. Photograph: iStockWith the new style in-house Leaving Cert grades very much on my mind, I’ve been trying to establish how much past data and how much future speculation I’m permitted to use as I calculate andor predict.I find it entertaining to observe whether fellow teachers refer to the in-house grades as “predicted” (future orientation, surely?) or “calculated” (past orientation, surely?), as this might reveal what will inform their grades.Many things have changed since last year and yet many things have remained the same. A new company has been appointed to oversee the process and there’s a new algorithm. Nobody quite knows whether to lament or celebrate this. A case of “better the devil you know”, perhaps? The students are way ahead of us all: they tell me not to worry too much. “It’s all designed so the marks won’t be too high this year,” says one particularly outspoken young man. “You might very well think that I couldn’t possibly comment,” I reply.“I LOVE Kevin Spacey, ” shouts another student, recognising the Francis Urquhart quote and we drift into talk of Netflix, which only comes to a (hasty) close because one of them asks me if I have seen Sex Education. I have. But this isn’t SPHE.DeprivedFor all its flaws the Leaving Certificate has been the cornerstone of Irish education for decades. Talk of reform never came to anything, and then in 2020 we were propelled into finding an emergency alternative. This year it’s less of an emergency but still very much an alternative to the main, live event as we have known it. This two-year hiatus has massive consequences for any formal and paced reform. The Leaving Cert cohorts of 2020 and 2021 will progress through the ranks of post-secondary life deprived in some ways, but perhaps richer in many more as a result of the especially challenging time endured in late teens.But it is the Intermediate Certificate, later the Junior Certificate, that may hold the key here. It may not have qualified as high currency in terms of an academic passport but it proved a great real-time motivator for students throughout the early years of secondary school. State exams ensured that they had a frame of reference for learning and developing studyrevision structures with a view to being formally assessed.I’ve seen many students give their all to the Junior Certificate to be rewarded with a clean sweep of top grades. Others took it handy to walk away relatively empty-handed. Of those who aced it, some became complacent and did less well when it mattered more. Others kept up a “winning streak” approach for the Leaving Cert. Those who were disappointed with their Junior Certificate results didn’t forget that feeling easily, and it served as a powerful motivator in senior cycle. The tables were often turned between Junior Cert and Leaving Cert and this taught students valuable lessons – about both learning and life.We are on a real break from formal State exams as we have previously known them. Do they have to resume as soon as it is physically possible? I would argue that they don’t, even that they shouldn’t.We have here a real opportunity to conduct proper reform – perhaps unlike any our education system has ever seen. Full consultation with all stakeholders. Proper piloting. Review and evaluation of the pilot phase in order that the finished product can be rolled out in a timely manner when it is ready. Why can’t this happen? The benefits are obvious: a thorough and well-paced reform process would truly transform what Ireland’s education system can offer its young people.The new junior cycle has been akin to the toddler who keeps bumping into things and cannot quite get sturdy on its legs. It has gathered far more doubters than believers. In its fragile infancy it needed to gain real traction, and these Covid years have meant that an increasing number of subjects have never been examined formally.On a national scale the CBAs (classroom-based assessments) have simply never taken off properly. Perhaps they have been embraced locally here and there, depending on the subject and the collective willingness or enthusiasm of a department. My one personal journey through CBAs goes something like this: first I drowned out the begrudgers to embrace CBAs and give them a fair chance (I genuinely saw potential). I enthused the students only to discover that they had already picked up on the anti-CBA vibes, so I had my work cut out for me.Slacking offMy colleagues in the department were great and we had some genuinely positive experiences, but seeing the benefits of the time spent on CBAs proved a problem. We weren’t covering as much material as we normally would and it became hard to justify this. Lack of reform at Leaving Certificate level meant it became increasingly difficult to make choices in junior cycle, which we felt would potentially disadvantage our students pedagogically later.And then came the deal-breaker: students started visibly slacking off. Why? Because they were getting superb feedback from other subjects in their CBAs and getting it relatively effortlessly. The students didn’t find CBAs hard work they were time out from the pressures of more formal and challenging assessments. Had this really been the plan? Not unlike with the Leaving Certificate in-house grades, I’m not sure where I am.What I do know is that the credibility of the new junior cycle, which was proving seriously difficult to build anyway, is well and truly compromised by the non-event assessments in 2020 and 2021. Past and present combined mean we can both calculate and predict challenging times at that level."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Review of State\u0026rsquos environmental record warns of post-pandemic rise in emissionsOECD report shows that while renewable energy usage is rising, targets are still being missedCountry still suffers from \u0026lsquohigh water losses and hot spots of low drinking water quality\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"public urged not to buy ducklings after reports of street sales in dublin","story":"There are concerns for the ducklings’ welfare, who have particular temperature and feeding requirements to survive, Gillian Bird from the DSCPA says. File photograph: Getty Images The Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA) is calling on the public not to buy ducklings following reports that the young birds were being offered for sale on the city streets.She said it seems a mixture of farmyard and wild ducklings are being sold, and there are suspicions people are taking wild ducklings from the canal to sell them.She explained that farmyard ducklings are “the lovely little yellow ones” while brown ducklings might be from different breeds of ducks that live on canals and ponds.Ms Bird said there is a trend on social media where people were videoing a day in the life of a duckling, which the DSCPA believes is contributing to the sales.“We suspect that what is happening is that it has caught on now – people know that others are going to buy ducklings, they go down to the canal, scoop up a few ducklings and they seem to be selling them for about €5 each,” Ms Bird said.“We started getting reports yesterday of people saying that they had been offered ducklings for sale on the streets, we know that some people had actually gone out to buy ducklings.”The DSPCA has had reports of young teenagers approaching other teenagers offering them a duckling for €5, she said. “We had one lady who actually bought 10 of them off some kids.”‘Very worried’“It’s one of those situations where we’re very worried,” Ms Bird said. “Where have they come from? Who’s going to look after them? Are they going to be looked after properly? A family home, living in your bathtub, is not a good home for a duckling.”Ms Bird explained that it takes up to four weeks for a duckling’s feathers to become fully waterproof. “So you end up with a situation where they get very cold if they’re not kept in the correct environment like under a heat lamp or a heat pad. They’ve got to be kept warm, they’ve got to be fed properly. They also have a life of between seven and 15 years, so what are people going to be doing with them long term?”There were already videos on social media of people saying they were now tired of their duckling and they were going to release them back into the canal, she added.“These ducklings are very young, they should be with their parents, they should be looked after properly and they’re just going to get picked off by predators and are going to die,” Ms Bird said."},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspis also in talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top five cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high risk (cohort 4) and those aged 60 to 69 (cohort 5).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be\u0026nbsppeople\u0026nbspaged 16 to 64 who are at high risk (cohort 7).

Being a banished baby of Tuam, this means so much to me!‘Post-pedicure I shall float, no longer anchored to Earth by my curling, witches’ nails’PATRICIA DONLON IrelandThe big excitement for me this week is that I am having a pedicure tomorrow. Oh, the luxury! But, not really a luxury, for when you reach my age (78) your toe nails have emigrated to unreachable realms – somewhere down there. Already toenails have burst through numerous socks, snagged on the bedclothes and have generally become a health and safety hazard. Hence my breath-holding excitement at the prospect of sitting in a chair with my feet in hot water awaiting the snipping, filing and massaging of handmaidens (almost exclusively female). To know that post-pedicure I shall float, no longer anchored to Earth by my curling, witches’ nails. Tomorrow to fresh fields and pastures new. Oh the indulgence of life post Covid lockdown! Brave New World.‘The longest time in our lives that we haven’t been in each other’s company. It viscerally hurts’ISOLDE Ó BROLCHÁIN CARMODY Manorhamilton, IrelandI haven’t seen my mum in nearly 18 months. It was January 2020 when I was last with her down in Dublin. We’re both disabled, so it’s not a simple or inexpensive proposition for us to visit each other. When restrictions were lifted last summer, my number one plan was to hug my mother. Then she got Covid. Thankfully, it wasn’t bad enough to warrant hospitalisation, but it has left her with long Covid. But she was ill at exactly the point in time when I could have seen her. I could have hugged her. Now it’s nearly a year later – we’re not going to see each other until we’re both fully vaccinated. But it has been the longest time in both of our lives that we haven’t been in each other’s company. It viscerally hurts. Even when the rest of the world gets back to normal, I’ll still be living in lockdown conditions. There is no local accessible public transport, and the Government doesn’t fund private accessible transport plus the driver I would need to get out of my house independently. I’ve been enjoying online working during the pandemic, but I won’t be able to compete – not as a performing artist – once mainstream society goes back to its old expectations. Thousands of people across Ireland will remain in lockdown long past 2021 unless there is radical change in Government disability policy.‘Our hope is to be there’BONNIE RANUM Valley City, North Dakota, United StatesWe had to cancel our trip to Ireland in March of 2020 and our hope is to be there in March of 2022.‘Our daughter’s wedding, a lovely day for everyone’MARY RICE Belfast, Northern Ireland Yeah, loads of “ordinary things” I’m looking forward to doing like meeting up with friends and family, going to a gig, spending an afternoon in the pub, holidaying back in Schull, west Cork, again but more than anything we’re hoping our daughter’s wedding (postponed three times) goes ahead when restrictions ease and looking forward to a lovely day for everyone.‘I can’t wait to be in a room full of voices singing in harmony’ELLEN O’DRISCOLL Ireland As a music education student, the thing I am most looking forward to is the return of choirs and groups singing.

Likewise, real world data shows that the Pfizer vaccine offers 97 per cent protection against mortality after two doses.The new models have also finally factored in the impact the vaccines have of reducing transmission. Previously, they ignored data showing AstraZeneca was reducing transmission by 67 per cent and Pfizer by 75 per cent.SPI-M states in its latest paper: “All scenarios from the three groups lead to another wave, however these are considerably smaller than modelling at Step 2 of the roadmap. “This is primarily the results of new emerging evidence of the extent to which vaccines reduce onward transmission from people who are vaccinated but nevertheless become infected. “At Monday\u0027s press conference, Sir Patrick said: “Over the next month there will be many more people vaccinated.“Everything is pointing to the fact vaccines are a very effective reduction in hospitalisations and deaths. If we carry on without variants we’re definitely pointing in the right direction.”One important feature of the new modelling is that, now, more realistic estimates of the number of people immune to the virus have been used.In a paper dating from March 30, Imperial said that even with optimistic vaccine efficiency, just 44.6 per cent of the population would be protected, through prior disease or the jab, by June 21.The new paper now assumes that the number protected against severe disease by the time restrictions are fully lifted will be 60 per cent. Many experts believe Britain has entered a state of at least partial herd immunity. The modellers have also factored in that people will naturally be more cautious after the pandemic, with many continuing to work from home and levels of contact unlikely to go back to pre-crisis levels in the short term.In February, modellers warned that subsequent waves would cause unsustainable pressure on the NHS. The experts warned that maintaining baseline measures to reduce transmission once restricted are lifted would save many lives and minimise the threat to hospital capacity.Now they have admitted there will be no threat to hospital capacity. The latest paper concludes, that even if there is a resurgence of hospital admissions and deaths, it is highly unlikely to put unsustainable pressure on the NHS. The link between infections and admissions has now been broken, and up to 90 per cent of people who would have ordinarily ended up in hospital after contracting Covid would no longer be admitted.In Monday\u0027s press conference Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said: “The view of all chief medical officers based on advice is not only that rates are very low in hospital, but that we do not think there is a likelihood in the next period of seeing a significant increase on pressure on the NHS.”In February, LSHTM estimated that schools returning would cause the R number to rise to between 1.1 and 1.5. It didn’t. Imperial also predicted that that the opening of non-essential shops and outdoor hospitality on April 12 would see R rise to 1.2. Yet the latest government estimates suggest that the R value is stable between 0.8 and 1.Although Monday saw a rise in infection rates of 3.1 per cent, tests have risen in the same period by 8.9 per cent. On Monday, the Government moved the Covid-19 alert level from four to three. But it is unclear why it has not been lowered further to two, a designation for when infections and transmission is low.It’s clear we’re now out the tunnel. Even the modellers are in agreement. So let’s speed up the release and celebrate a summer of normality. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"inside americas cold case revolution new super effective dna","story":"Convicted killer Ledell Lee protested his innocence up until his death in 2017 by lethal injection at an Arkansas county prison.Lee was accused of strangling and fatally bludgeoning a 26-year-old woman in 1993, but his prints were never found on the murder weapon and testimony putting him at the scene was later discovered to have been flawed.Four years after his death, the state agreed to allow a new test of the DNA evidence from the crime scene that used sophisticated genome sequencing.What it showed was conclusive - they had executed the wrong man. The DNA was not a match for Lee, but another - still unknown - killer.“The investigation into the case remains open due to the possibility of a future database ‘hit’ to the unknown male DNA or unknown fingerprints from the crime scene,” Nina Morrison, Senior Litigation Counsel at the Innocence Project, said in a statement last week.There was no match found in the FBI’s national database, but Lee’s family is hoping that a relatively new forensic technique - which identifies suspects through DNA similarities with relatives - will help finally clear his name.Investigators in the US have had considerable success with it so far. Since identifying in 2018 the so-called Golden State killer, who murdered 13 people and raped dozens in the 1970s and 80s, they have solved more than 50 other cold cases.While the development has been welcomed by the Innocence Project and those fighting for justice for the accused, others have serious concerns about the implications for privacy.Some of the more rudimentary DNA testing is being done by generating a subset of key markers from a person’s DNA code, like an abridged version of a book.But increasingly, investigators are turning to private companies for whole-genome sequencing, which reconstructs a person’s entire DNA code and gives investigators the tools to solve cases much quicker and easier.They then compare the DNA code with data from ancestry sites such as GEDMatch and FamilyTreeDNA.Unlike state and federal criminal databases, theirs are enormous, including millions of people who have voluntarily uploaded their own genetic information.Many, such as Ancestry and 23andMe, opted not to make them accessible to law enforcement.But data from GEDMatch, a popular website for tracking down lost family members, has helped police find a suspect in a case that reached trial just last week in Florida.Former sailor Thomas Garner, 61, was arrested in March 2019 for the 1984 killing of 25-year-old Pamela Cahanes, his fellow classmate at the Orlando Naval Training Center, after genetic firm Parabon NanoLabs re-tested a semen stain found on Miss Cahanes’ underwear. Further testing on the DNA sample allowed experts at Parabon to create the unknown suspect\u0027s “family tree,” which ultimately led the authorities to Garner.He has now been linked to a second cold-case killing in Hawaii around the same time, in 1982.GEDMatch changed its access policy not long after Garner’s arrest, requiring users to explicitly “opt in” to law enforcement searches. Ethicists said the decision ensured that users would be properly informed about how their profiles would be used.“People using genetic genealogy databases for their own purposes never anticipated this kind of access to their genetic information or that information being used to identify people they’re related to,” said Amy McGuire, director of the Center for Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the Baylor College of Medicine.There is “a genuine tension between wanting to protect consumers and be respectful of their wishes and recognising that working with law enforcement provides a social benefit,” she said.A recent Baylor College of Medicine survey last year found 91 per cent of respondents favoured law enforcement using consumer DNA databases to solve violent crimes, and 46 per cent for nonviolent crimes.The UK Government has conducted studies looking at how such DNA sequencing would work in Britain, but a decision on the controversial technique is yet to be made.In January of this year, GEDMatch adapted its policy to allow its entire database to be used for forensic searches related to unidentified remains.This gave scientists from the DNA Doe Project their break in identifying the body of an unknown woman in Indiana, thought to have been the victim of a serial killer who was prolific in the 1980s.They had a tiny biological sample, which contained only 0.3 nanograms, or 300 trillionths of a gram, of genetic material.It was first matched with just a handful of distant cousins, but when GEDMatch policy was changed the scientists suddenly found much closer matches which enabled them to identify her as Jenifer Noreen Denton, a 24-year-old mother-of-one from Illinois. They are now working on trying to find her killer.In Lee’s case, the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory has not yet searched the state database, despite being pressed to do so by the Innocence Project and Lee’s family.“We are glad there is new evidence in the national DNA database,” said Patricia Young, Lee’s sister. “We can only remain hopeful that there will be further information uncovered in the future.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to

of its workers with a message offering a one-off payment as a “gift” to “inspire” them to keep up the “good work” during the pandemic But those who clicked through on the email, sent on behalf of the company’s director Julian Edwards, received a second email informing them it was a “phishing simulation test” designed by the company.  “This was a test designed by our IT team to entice you to click the link and used both the promise of thanks and financial reward,” the email read.  Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association (TSSA) lambasted the exercise as “crass and reprehensible”.  Mr Cortes said: “This was a cynical and shocking stunt by West Midlands Trains, designed to trick employees who have been on the frontline throughout this terrible pandemic – ensuring essential workers were able to travel.“It’s almost beyond belief that they chose to falsely offer a bonus to workers who have done so much in the fight against this virus.”“Our members have made real sacrifices these past 12 months and more. Some WMT staff have caught the disease at work, one has tragically died, and others have placed family members at great risk.”The TSSA has demanded West Midlands “stump up” a real bonus to their employees in recompense for the “needless wrong which has caused so much hurt”. A spokesman for West Midlands Trains confirmed that their employees had not received a bonus.  He said: “We take cyber security very seriously, providing regular training on the subject and we run exercises to test our resilience. “Fraud cost the transport industry billions of pounds every year.

The little verse expresses a well-known sentiment: that however high and mighty, virtuous or viceful, we might be, we are all going the same way. Benjamin Franklin, another resident of my church (although in a more secular manner: he was apprenticed to a printer who at that time occupied our Lady Chapel), put it more pithily: “in this world, nothing is certain except death and taxes.”Memorials in churches tell of the march of time. They tell of the journey we will all take, and they tell of the journey that particular church, and its nation, has taken. It is in that light that the Church of England is issuing guidance to its churches regarding memorials to those involved in slavery and empire.Remove, relocate, alter, contextualise. That is the advice. We don’t get to choose those among whom we’re going to be buried – not into the future at any rate. Which is good, as we don’t get to choose those among whom we’re going to spend eternity. Crooks, thieves, adulterers and murderers sit alongside saints and heroes. Quite often they’re the same people only occasionally do we know it. We are all a mix of holy, virtuous, ambiguous, self- interested, and downright sinful. It’s what makes us human.Two more tombs face each other across the church: those of Prior Rahere, who founded our Priory Church in 1123, and Sir Walter Mildmay who, as a member of the Court of Augmentations, helped dissolve it. Their views on each other would be unprintable.Jesus was remarkably silent about the great issues which vex us these days – gender, sexuality, slavery, the lot. What he was very vocal about was forgiveness. “Judge not, let as ye judge so shall ye be judged” is probably the golden thread that runs through his teaching. “Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us” puts a heavy burden on us if we refuse to forgive.And this isn’t just about little sins that we don’t care very much about. The parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector sees a genuinely good man standing in judgment over the agent of a vicious oppressive regime (who will have stood accused of using extortion and sexual abuse as part of his day-today work). One of them praised God for his own goodness, the other lowered his eyes to the floor and said, “have mercy upon me, a sinner”. Only one of the two went home justified. It was not the pharisee.But the pharisee is the patron saint of our day. As we prepare to stand in judgment against long-dead agents of slavery and empire, we had better be pretty sure we have no sins of our own that might be held up when we too are judged, just as we now judge.Are we so sure our views on, say, abortion or military intervention, or our use of Uyghur-made cotton, will stand up to the scrutiny of future generations? Or God? If we reserve our churches to the sinless, we reserve them only to Christ. There is no space for you and me, no matter how sure we are that our sins aren’t really that bad.If the Cross means anything, it means that people whose sins we think are vile will find themselves sharing not only a churchyard with us, but the whole of eternity.Behowlde yourselves by usMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cricket lawmaker mcc rejects bamboo bats grass not wood","story":"Cricket\u0027s lawmakers the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) has rejected that bamboo bats could provide an alternative to willow because bamboo is grass and not wood. In order for bamboo bats to be given the go-ahead, there would need to be an amendment to the laws of cricket. And the MCC has vowed to discuss this at the next laws sub-committee meeting. In a statement, the club said: MCC has read with interest the research study from the University of Cambridge, which suggests that cricket bats made from bamboo offer a more suitable alternative to the traditional use of willow.Currently, Law 5.3.2 states that the blade of the bat must consist solely of wood, so for bamboo (which is a grass) to be considered as a realistic alternative to willow would require a law change.  Importantly, the law would need to be altered to allow bamboo specifically, as even if it were to be recognised as a wood, this would still be illegal under the current Law, which bans lamination of the blade, except in junior bats.MCC’s role as  of the laws includes maintaining the balance between bat and ball, and any potential amendments to the law would need to carefully take this into consideration, particularly the concept of the bat producing greater power.In 2008 the MCC banned bats with a graphite shaft which were being used by professionals and amateur players and in 2017 the lawmakers cracked down on the increasing dimensions of modern bats by imposing a law that meant a bat could be a maximum of 108mm in width, 67mm in depth and 40mm edges.The statement added: Sustainability is a relevant topic for MCC and indeed cricket, and this angle of willow alternatives should also be considered.With the researchers stating that the most suitable types of bamboo grow abundantly across China and that low-cost production could make bamboo bats a viable and ethical alternative to willow, this could provide a pertinent angle for further research and the possibility of reducing the cost of producing bats in different areas of the world.The club will discuss the topic at the next laws sub-committee meeting.The  reported on Monday how a Cambridge University study indicated that a prototype bamboo cricket bat had a larger sweet spot than a traditional willow blade, is stronger, more sustainable and cheaper to produce.The lower cost could boost participation in countries such as India and China which have fewer financial resources, according to the research published in the Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology.The study indicated that bamboo is 22 percent stiffer than willow which increases the speed at which the ball leaves the bat.Researchers said the sweet spot on their prototype performed 19 percent better than that on a traditional willow bat and was closer to the toe.Dr Darshil Shah of Cambridge\u0027s Centre for Natural Material Innovation, who is a former member of Thailand\u0027s under-19 national cricket team, said: This is a batsman\u0027s dream.The sweet spot on a bamboo bat makes it much easier to hit a four off a yorker for starters, but it\u0027s exciting for all kinds of strokes.We\u0027d just need to adjust our technique to make the most of it, and the bat\u0027s design requires a little optimisation too.The investigations included microscopic analysis, video capture technology, computer modelling, compression testing, and testing for vibrations.Players using bamboo bats would not feel any more vibration than with a willow bat, according to the research.The study points out there is a shortage of good-quality willow, which takes up to 15 years to mature - mostly in England - to the point where the wood can be used to make cricket bats.By contrast, the maturing age of Moso bamboo is five to six years and it grows abundantly in China, south-east Asia and South America.Study co-author Ben Tinkler-Davies said: Cricket brings you really close to nature, you spend hours out in the field, but I think the sport can do a lot more for the environment by promoting sustainability.We\u0027ve identified a golden opportunity to achieve that while also helping lower income countries to produce bats at lower cost.The materials used to make cricket bats are regulated by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the sport\u0027s governing body, and rules say the blade shall consist solely of wood.Dr Shah said: Bamboo is a grass not a wood so there would need to be discussions with the MCC, but we think playing with a bamboo bat would be within the spirit of the game because it\u0027s a plant-based material and cane, a type of grass, is already used in the handle.Tradition is really important but think about how much cricket bats, pads, gloves and helmets have already evolved.The width and thickness of bats have changed dramatically over the decades.So if we can go back to having thinner blades but made from bamboo, while improving performance, outreach and sustainability, then why not?The pair tested the sound of leather on bamboo and Mr Tinkler-Davies insisted the frequency is very similar to willow, adding: Whether you\u0027re playing or spectating, you wouldn\u0027t notice much of a difference.Because laminated bamboo is so strong, we\u0027re very confident we can make a bamboo bat light enough, even for today\u0027s fast-scoring, short forms of the game.The researchers hope to enter discussions with the MCC and leading bat manufacturers.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"queen speech pictures photos state opening parliament boris","story":"The Queen delivers her speech from the throne in the House of Lords during the State Opening of ParliamentEddie Mulholland for The Christopher Eccleston: Dr Who is a ‘boy’s club’, and cyberwomen should replace ‘cybermen’Coronavirus latest news: \u0026#39People\u0026#39s Vaccine\u0026#39 protesters clash with police at AstraZeneca HQComment: By ditching compulsory face masks in schools, the government is finally prioritising children\u0026#39s welfareTen killed in Belfast by British Army were \u0026#39entirely innocent\u0026#39, coroner rulesEnglish Heritage condemns \u0026#39trophy hunters\u0026#39 who took pictures after shooting deer at stately homeMaskless Queen sits alone as she delivers speech at State Opening of Parliament Man, 21, charged with murder of PCSO Julia JamesTwo Israeli women killed by Gaza rockets as Netanyahu vows to \u0026#39step up\u0026#39 offensiveTech giants face multi-billion pound fines for failing to protect children onlinePolice prepare to dig up cafe where Fred West victim Mary Bastholm ‘may be buried’Comment: Obesity is out of of control.

From next Monday, hugging between people from dferent bubbles will be allowed for the first time in  months People will be able to meet outdoors in groups of up to  people - up from just six now. And crucially, people from dferent households or bubbles can meet indoors socially for the first time. These indoor gatherings will be limited to six people or a maximum of two households or bubbles - whichever is larger.  That means pubs, bars and restaurants can reopen indoors for the first time since the New Year. But venues will still have to follow social distancing rules and table service only, while masks will remain. Likewise, the legal ban on travel outside the UK will be lted - but there’s still a maze of dferent rules. And school pupils will no longer have to wear masks in class or corridors - but should still get tested twice a week. Boris Johnson told a No press conference it was the biggest single change to lockdown - just as figures show the number of UK cases of the India iant have more than doubled in a week, to . He said it was a “very considerable unlocking” and “there will be a lot of extra movement, a lot of extra contact” as a result. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said deaths should stay low as older people have now mostly been vaccinated, but there is a risk of signicant spread amongst those in the younger age groups. So what can and can’t you do under England’s lockdown changes  Here’s a full rundown from May .You can finally hug loved ones againFrom May , the government will axe guidance in place since March  that says people should stay two metres apart from anyone outside their household or bubble. With a third of adults having both vaccine doses, people will instead be told they can choose whether to socially distance from family and close friends. This means people can choose to hug, kiss or shake hands with friends or relatives in the park or in a home.  People do not have to take a lateral flow test before hugging, but it’s one way of reducing the spread of the disease. Likewise people could meet outdoors or with the windows open, or wear masks. There is no limit to the amount of time you can spend with people in a day, or the time spent in a pub or restaurant.Officials say this change is a move towards “living with” coronavirus into the future - and it does NOT mean social distancing rules have been scrapped.Close contact with an infectious person is still the most likely way to catch Covid- and the vaccine is not % effective. Broader social distancing rules, including in public venues like pubs and restaurants, will remain until at least June  - more of this below.  From May , people from dferent households or bubbles will be allowed to meet indoors for the first time since the New Year. This must be in a maximum group of up to six people or two households - whichever is larger. The six-person limit includes babies and children, they’re not exempt. However, this change means that for the first time since January, you can visit family where in England and stay the night .You can have sex with someone you don’t already live withThe indoor meetings ban is being lted, and guidance against any social contact is being eased. Taken together this means casual sex is back on. But people are still being advised to make personal judgements in line with the risks. It doesn’t mean you should go around touching anyone you meet. You can go indoors at pubs and restaurants - in groups of sixThe rule of six indoors applies equally to hospitality venues such as pubs, restaurants and cafes, as it does to private homes. This means they will be allowed to open indoors on May  for the first time since the New Year. As with private homes, there will still be a maximum gathering size of six people or two households at each table. Pubs will also be table service only, so you can’t prop up the bar. You’ll also need to wear a face mask when walking around between tables, and scan in on entry using the NHS Covid- app. But there is no need to order a “substantial meal” with a drink any more.You can have parties of up to  people outdoorsThe current limit of six people for outdoor gatherings will be removed on May . Instead, there will only be a much higher legal limit of  people for outdoor gatherings, except for some organised events as outlined below. This will mean large groups are once again allowed to gather in parks like last summer. You can go on holiday properly in EnglandCurrently, only self-contained holiday accommodation can open in England - and people can only stay with their own bubble. Once you can stay overnight with people from dferent bubbles on May , that means hotels, BBs and other holiday venues like hostels can reopen. England’s domestic tourism industry is allowed to be back in business.You can go on holiday abroad - but it’s severely limitedThe legal ban on taking a holiday outside the UK will be lted on May  and travel will be allowed. However, Brits ing from the vast majority of countries will have to isolate on their , either at home or in a £,-a-head hotel. Only ‘green list’ countries will be exempt from this and there are currently only a tiny handful of countries on the list, including Portugal and Israel. Most of the countries on the UK’s green list still require Brits to isolate when they get to that country, making holiday plans worthless. And evenyou can travel without quarantine at either end, youaposll have to fork out your own money for Covid tests to comply with travel rules. However, restrictions are widely expected to ease quite quickly as we move into June and July. You can stop making your kids wear masks at schoolFace coverings for pupils will no longer be recommended in secondary schools or colleges from May  - either in classrooms or communal areas. Face masks couldin some schoolsthere are local outbreaks, as officials admit some discretion will be needed. Twice weekly home testing for school pupils will remain to control infection rates. You canto university… just in time for the year to endUniversity students on non-practical courses can finallyto in-person teaching and learning from May . That is despite the fact students’ academic years will be over or nearly over by then. All students and staff will be encouraged to take three rapid “lateral flow” tests, supervised on-site, about three to four days apart. They’ll then be expected to test themselves twice a week for the remainder of the term.You can go to a funeral without worrying about a -person limitThe cap on mourners at funerals will be axed ahead of schedule on May . Currently funerals can only have  attendees while wakes are limited to . Instead of a -person limit, venues will decide how many people can attend safely while still keeping up social distancing rules. That means two metres between mourners, or one metre plus mitigations like masks, screens and ventilation - although evidently, hugging is now allowed. Wakes will still have a cap of  people. You can go to a big stadium event or theatre showFans canto sports fixtures in Step Three, with outdoor venues permitted capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is lower. In the largest outdoor seated venues, where crowds can spread out, up to , people will be able to attend, or grounds can be a quarter-full, whichever is fewer. Fans can attend larger performances and sporting events indoors, with capacities of , people or half-full, whichever is fewer. Other events have already been taking place - with bigger crowds and no social distancing - but theyaposre part of a special pilot scheme and people must get negative tests to enter.You can go to a sauna or steam roomGyms and spas were allowed to open at the last stage of the roadmap, but their saunas and steam rooms had to remain shut. Now they can restart - as can indoor group sports and exercise classes, which were restricted to outdoors-only before.You can go to museums and children’s play areasRemaining outdoor entertainment, such as outdoor theatres and cinemas, can reopen in Step Three. And so can indoor entertainment, such as museums and children’s play areas.You can go to the cinema - but you have to wear a maskCinemas can finally reopen for the first time in around five months on May . But film-lovers will have to wear masks through the show, unless they are eating or drinking at the time. Perhaps making popcorn-eaters even more annoying. You can go to parent and child groups - and your kids won’t count towards the limitParent and child groups can resume with up to  attendees. And unlike the other caps on gatherings, babies and children under five do not count towards the -person limit in these groups. That means  mums or dads can attend, and take their kids with them.You can have more visitors in a care homeCare home visiting will be eased further, with residents able to have up to five named visitors - up from two now. These named visitors can make regular visits and physical contact, although they should get a negative rapid test and wear PPE before visiting. Residents will also be able to make “low risk” trips outside their home without isolating for  days when they get back - a policy that caused outrage.You CAN’T break social distancing in the pubWider social distancing rules and regulations remain in place - such as in social care, shops and pubs and restaurants. Pubs and restaurants will still have to obey the one-metre-plus rule, where people stay two metres apart or one metre with mitigations like a perspex screen. Laws ordering venue owners to ensure customers are following the rules remain the same, despite the relaxation on hugging within a group.You CAN’T go around hugging everyoneImportantly, the new hugging guidance is aimed at people meeting within legally-allowed group sizes - six indoors,  outdoors. It does not apply to people from two dferent small gatherings hugging, or strangers hugging in the street or a pub. People will be told to exercise their own personal judgement in line with the risks. They will be urged to remain cautious, because some people are more vulnerable to severe illness than others and vaccines do not eliminate the risk from Covid. Boris Johnson said: “This doesn’t mean we can suddenly throw caution to the winds. In fact, more than a year into this pandemic we all know close contact such as hugging is a direct way of transmitting this disease.

Announcing that step three of the roadmap will be triggered in England, the Prime Minister said: “This unlocking amounts to a very considerable step on the road back to normality and I am confident we will be able to go further.” But chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said masks may still be needed on public ­transport and it will still be table-service for at least another five weeks for pubs and bars. While more curbs will be relaxed from Monday, May , other restrictions will stay in force for at least another five weeks until June  – the earliest date for triggering Step Four of the unlocking “roadmap”. Here are answers to seven key questions about the remaining restrictions. Why am I still being told to work from homeI can   Some workplaces struggle to make their premises Covid-secure. Many staff would use public transport, where social distancing is much more dficult, to get to their offices. Repealing the “work from homeyou can” advice will inevitably lead to more commuters on buses, trains and trams, creating conditions where the disease likes to spread. Why can’t we have more than six people or one other household in our homes  The more people who gather indoors, the more likely it is that someone will have coronavirus and the more favourable the conditions for transmitting the disease. Depending on the size of your home, six people can fill a living room or lead to it being cramped around a dining table. There is also evidence that the more people there are from dferent families, the more likely it is that caution will be left outside. Why can’t we meet in groups bigger than  outside   Thirty is deemed enough for an exercise class, a ramblers’ group, a local history club or nature reserve members’ club to be able to meet and enjoy themselves without jeopardising safety. Much bigger than that and a gathering becomes a mini-festival. Why can’t I order a pint or pie and chips at the bar  Pubs, restaurants and cafes will only be able to offer table service until at least June . This is a subtle way of regulating numbers and ensuring venues do not become too busy, which would undermine attempts to enforce social distancing. It stops rowdy punters crowding at the bar, shouting at staff and potentially spreading or contracting the virus. People sat at tables are far more spaced out than those packing into pubs where it is standing room only. Why can’t I go clubbing   Clubbing is a pastime mainly enjoyed by younger people – most of whom are not vaccinated and therefore more likely to contract, spread and fall ill from coronavirus. The sheer volume of people and their close proximity to each other would help fuel Covid- transmission. The fact clubbers are usually in drink would also help shed their inhibitions and create a climate for riskier behaviour – potentially helping spread the disease. Why can’t I go to more foreign countries  The “traffic light” regime for international travel unveiled next week takes effect from Monday but is separate from the overall roadmap. Just  nations or territories are deemed green for the restart of non-essential overseas trips, with Portugal the only country that is really popular with British holidaymakers. Experts study a countries’ vaccination and infection rates before deciding on their categorisation. Social contactSix people or two households can mix indoors and groups of up to  outdoors Hugs with close family and friends permitted but caution urged Up to  people can attend weddings and cap on funerals removed Care home residents can have up to five named visitors and more freedom to go out.LeisurePubs, restaurants and cafes can serve people indoors, with social distancing Indoor entertainment, e.g. cinemas, theatres, concert halls, museums to reopen Sports stadiums can welcome back fans, subject to crowd limits.TravelHotels, BBs and hostels can reopenInternational travel to “green list” countries can recommence.Education Face masks no longer necessary for secondary school pupils University students can resume in-person teaching.* Changes apply to England only The system exists to prevent importations of coronavirus iants which might jeopardise the success of the UK’s inoculation scheme. More nations will switch from amber, and perhaps even red, to green as the months march on and cases rates dwindle while vaccination levels rise. Reviews will be held every three weeks and the list of potential summer destinations for those desperate for a sunshine break is expected to grow. What about outside England  In Wales, pubs, restaurants, bars and cafés are open outdoors, and from Monday, May  will offer indoor service for tables of up to four people from up to four dferent households. Pubs, restaurants, bars and cafés in Scotland can open outdoors until pm and are permitted to serve alcohol.

Ellie Cooper, , and boyfriend Ryan Beedham, , revamped the run-down, three-bedroom property into a stylish abode, and boosted its worth by more than half of what they paid for it. The pair bought their first home together, an outdated cottage with yellowing tobacco-stained walls and an overgrown garden, during lockdown in May  for £,. Despite the mould and terrible state of the property, they quickly set about transforming it into their dream home, beginning by re-plastering and painting the walls.  The couple amassed a following of nearly , people on TikTok, as they showed viewers how they completed the transformation. There wasnapost one room that was finished and looked somewhat okay, Ellie, a student, said. It was very outdated and run-down when we bought it. It was a big project to take on but it had so much potential. The wallpaper was the worst to get off as when we tried to steam it, the tobacco from the old owner seeped through and made it so sticky.  During the renovations the pair unfortunately encountered a damp issue and had to have the cottage, in Barnsley, damp-proofed, re-plastered and painted for a second time. But after laying a fresh base, Ellie and Ryan were free to start decorating and make the cottage suit their tastes. They lived at Ryanaposs parentsapos house while they completed the work, setting themselves a seven-month deadline so they could be in their new home by Christmas. The bedrooms were given a stylish upgrade, with a trendy black-led wall in the master bedroom and modern furnishings replacing the tattered carpets and furniture.  Meanwhile the kitchen was given a major overhaul after the couple knocked down the wall blocking it from the dining room, creating a large, open-plan space. They then installed fresh appliances and white cabinets with wooden countertops. But the most impressive transformation was the bathroom, which originally comprised a dull, three-piece suite with dated floral tiles on the walls. Now, the room features a stunning walk-in shower, a sophisticated white tub and on-trend marble floor and walls. The living room was also given a fresh update, with a cosy corner sofa, neutral colours, and exposed wood beams to retain the old cottage feel.  The garden was revamped from an overgrown mass of greenery to a polished lawn with a separate concrete BBQ area. In total, the couple spent around £, fixing up the historic home, but their efforts weren’t wasted. Recent valuations indicate it is now worth around £,. Taking advantage of the profit they’ve made, the couple have now decided to sell the property and build a six-bedroom house on part of the land next to the cottage.

And it has already-stretched GPs worried about the potential extra workload dumped on their laps in the coming weeks. The NHS app will be ready to be used as a de facto vaccine passport when the borders re-open on Monday for non-essential travel, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. But there could be a major aposglitchapos in the system that will see surgery switchboards clogged up with wannabe jet-setters needing permission for upgrades. Former British Medical Association chairman Mark Porter, a GP himself in Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, said many people may not have access to all the information contained in the NHS app, including inoculation status. And thataposstheyaposve even downloaded it at all.Are you a GP who is concerned about the NHS app being used as a vaccine passport  Let us know at webnews@mirror It is dferent to the NHSX-developed Covid app which came out last year and is used for contact tracing. Rather, the NHS app was launched a couple of years ago to allow patients to request repeat prescriptions, arrange doctors appointments and view medical records.Writing in a column for The Times yesterday, Dr Porter said: The whole process takes about five minutes, but there can be up to a week’s delay before you are granted access to your records — another reason to do it now rather than just before you travel. Depending on how your electronic record was set up, you may not have access to all the information it contains, including your vaccine status. NHS advice is to contact your GP to upgrade your accessrequired, butmillions of travellers do that our switchboard is going to be even more overwhelmed than it is at the moment.  Dr Porter said it is a stumbling block that is worrying practices like mine anda solution isnapost found upgrading access on an inidual basis is simply not feasible given pressures. The UK government has announced a aposgreen listapos of  countries which can be travelled to from May  without the need to quarantine for two-weeks onhome. Among the list are Portugal, Iceland, Israel and Gibraltar, with travel companies seeing a surge in bookings for the former in particular.

The Mirror found scores of Romanians among the tens of thousands of people crossing the fast-flowing Rio Grande from Mexico into the States. Their perilous trek involves walking through the notorious city of Miguel Aleman, across the river from Roma, Texas, where we heard constant heavy gunfire between the rival Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas crime gangs. Every night for a week the Mirror watched thousands delivered by the inflatable boatload on to US soil. Among them were Europeans who no longer felt able to make it to the UK, their intended destination, after Britain left the EU.They have seized on US President Joe Biden ’s relaxation of predecessor Donald Trump ’s ruthless border policy, flying from countries such as Romania and Latvia to Mexico before crossing the Rio Grande.What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  Border agents patrolling the river confirmed that they have seen an influx of Europeans since January , when the UK split from the EU. One said: “Both America and Britain offer a similar safe le to these people. But given the choice of crossing the English Channel with children and babies or being rowed  yards across the Rio Grande in a rubber boat, I guess they feel we [America] are now a safer option.“We all think Brexit is responsible, for sure. Most Europeans are flying through Paris into places like Cancun [in Mexico] and then making their way here.“Ever since the beginning of February, we have seen the numbers increase.  “Because of Covid and the restrictions in Europe, it’s the path they have to take.” Since Brexit, Romanians wanting to live and work in the UK must apply for a visa under a points-based immigration system. They must speak English to the required standard and have a job offer. In  Romanians overtook the Irish and Indians as the second biggest immigrant community after Poles in the UK. However, they are now among the most vulnerable in Britain after Brexit, according to the East European Resource Centre – and some now see the UK as an unwelcoming place.  Over  years after the death of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and despite record % growth last year, communism has cast a long shadow over Romania and the country remains the second poorest EU member. And since Brexit, Romanians seeking a better le where have found the once-easy access to the UK now closed. One Romanian migrant, Sirbu Funeriu, , arrived in the US with his we Cristina and two children aged  months and five years. They were picked up by US Border Patrol after paying £, to the cartels to take them across the Rio Grande.  Engineer Sirbu said they had left their home in Ghimbav, near Brasov, on April , and flown to Mexico via Paris. He explained that two years ago they planned to move to the UK, but Brexit put paid to their plans as they felt there would be animosity towards them. After crossing into the US they were picked up and are now being processed while being held in a detainment centre. Just weeks after Mr Biden took office, the number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US-Mexico border began to soar, overwhelming the federal government’s resources and resulting in a scramble to find enough shelter space to accommodate them.  The volume of arrivals, combined with an unprepared administration, left thousands of children languishing in jail-like Border Patrol facilities, often for longer than the -hour limit set by federal law. The Biden administration is now scrambling to control the biggest surge in  years, with the nation on pace for as many as two million migrants at the southern border this year – the outcome the President said he wanted to avoid. The scale of the issue can be seen on the banks of the Rio Grande, where scattered for miles are the punctured dinghies and le jackets used by the human smugglers, known as coyotes. There are also thousands of colourful ripped-off wristbands issued by the drug cartels to identy migrants who have paid them for passage across the river. The dferent colours highlight how many times they have tried to cross and who is eligible to cross againthey have been sent back.  The wristbands we saw had dferent colours and words. Some read “entregadas”, meaning delivered. Others read “llegadas”, or arrivals. Those with red bands are first-time crossers, while yellow denotes those who have tried before and were sent back. As well as the physical peril of their journey, the migrants are in great danger once in the clutches of the highly organised cartels. As the gangs’ drug-smuggling ­operations were hindered by Covid they have turned Mr Biden’s softer border policy into a multi-million-dollar money-making scheme.

Despite the primitive methods they use to ferry migrants across the river, the cartels operate sophisticated schemes for this side of their business. They collect masses of data from those they traffic, learning how and where to reach family members of those they smuggle across.

Kavi and Mita Pujara say they are in a ‘David vs Goliath’ battle with Leicester City Council over the small structure they erected outside their home to keep their cycles safe.Council officials wrote to them in February telling them they should not have built the bespoke timber shed - which has a sedum grass roof - without seeking planning permission, LeicestershireLive reports.They said because the family lives in a conservation area where planning restrictions are tighter, permission would likely not have been granted in any case. They have also been warned they could face enforcement actionthey leave the shed standing.  The couple are now battling to save the shed and more than  people have written to the city council supporting their retrospective application to be allowed to keep it. Kavi told LeicestershireLive: “We put the shed up in September, when because of lockdown, cycling was about the only thing we could get out and do. “We now know we should have applied for permission at the time - and we are doing that now - but we didn’t just throw it up. “It wasn’t cheap. We did our research. “We found a sustainable eco-friendly shed which we think looks really good. “The council is giving out mixed messages - on the one hand saying it wants to encourage environmentally friendly transport while then threatening people over their bike storage.”  The Pujaras say the storage shed - which they intend to camouflage with ivy - is the only way they and their children Milan, , and ten-year-old Anamika - can realistically get their bikes from their home to the street. Mita said: “If we want to bring all four bikes out of the back of the houses we have sets of steps - and gates and locks. “We timed it. It takes  minutes to get them out and ready. The kids can’t do it without help. “From the shed it takes seconds and the children can be away pedalling. It’s liberating and empowering for them.” Kavi added: “There’s a real disconnect between departments at the council. There’s no joined up thinking. “You can’t say ‘We want people to cycle’ but then say ‘You can’t safely store your bikes outside your homeaposThe Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Photos show a woman, dressed in identical clothes to those worn by Ms James the day she died, walking the Jack Russell on a secluded footpath and through bushes close to the scene of the killing. Toby was found unharmed next to married mum-of-two Ms Jamesapos body on a footpath in Akholt Wood, near her home in Snowdown, just after pm on April . The reconstruction was carried out to recreate the route the beloved community support officer took on the day of her killing and to encourage any remaining witnesses to come forward. It took place on Tuesday as a man charged with murdering Ms James, , made his first appearance in court following his arrest last week.  Ms James - described as a “fiercely loyal” we, mother and grandmother by her heartbroken family - suffered severe head injuries when she was bludgeoned, police said previously. Loyal Toby stayed with her body after she was killed and was next to her when her body was discovered, detectives have said. On Tuesday, the actress wore identical clothes to those Ms Jamesapos was wearing when she was last seen - a light blue waterproof coat, blue jeans and dark boots - as she set off from the hamlet of Snowdown with Toby on a lead. She headed through a wooded area that opened out onto a wide field - the same route Ms James is believed to have taken in the moments before her killing. From there she headed down the edge of the farmland, with Aylesham Road to running along to her right. Toby, who has been looked after by Ms Jamesapos family in recent days, padded his way down the well-trodden path on what was a sunny afternoon in Kent. After rounding the field, the pair headed away from the road and towards an area of woodland that is now cordoned off with police tape. Police believe there are people who were in the area on the day of the killing who they want to speak to.  Speaking to reporters, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Richards said: That is her typical daily walk with Toby around the perimeter of that field. And finally you will see her concluding her walk around the field and entering the woodland where sadly she was found shortly after four oaposclock, two weeks ago today. He added: Today on the two-week anniversary of Juliaaposs death we will be conducting, with an actress and Juliaaposs Jack Russell dog Toby, a reconstruction. Once again I appeal to anybody who is seeing this footage today who remembers anything at all that could be of assistance to the investigation to help us piece together those last vital pieces.

The picture shows Ms James walking her Jack Russell, Toby, in a woodland while wearing a light blue waterproof coat, blue jeans and dark Wellington-style brown boots. Police said it was the same clothing, apart from the gloves, which she wore on the day she died. Wearing a grey jumper and flanked by two security officers in the dock, Callum Wheeler, , spoke hesitantly to confirm his name, date of birth and address as he appeared via videolink at Medway Magistrates’ Court.  He was remanded in custody to appear at Maidstone Crown Court on Thursday. Wheeler, who is from Aylesham, about a mile from Akholt Wood, was arrested on Friday and charged with murder on Monday. He was charged after detectives were given more time to question him in connection with the death of the police community support officer. A number of searches have been taking place in and around Akholt Wood and Snowdown, and at a home in Aylesham.  Speaking after the suspect was charged, Mr Richards said it has been a “hugely challenging” fortnight since the death of Ms James. He said detectives still want to hear from witnesses and the force continues to keep all options open. Mr Richards said the arrest was a huge step forward and there is nothing to suggest more than one person was involved in Ms Jamesapos death. He told reporters: “As many of you will be aware, yesterday shortly after pm detectives … charged a gentleman, Callum Wheeler, a -year-old man who lives in Aylesham, with the murder of Julia.

Loran Denison was  weeks pregnant with her fourth child when she was told her son had Edwardsapos syndrome. The rare and serious condition mean most children with Edwardsapos syndrome will die before or shortly after being born, or at a young age, with just  in  living past their st birthday. Loran and partner Scott Watson, , made the agonising decision to have a medical abortion after being told he was unlikely to be born alive. The -year-old took a tablet and ed to hospital to be induced at  weeks and four days - but was shocked when her son was born breathing and alive. And while the mum says she doesnapost want to deter anyone from making the right choice for them, she said watching him die was torture. Loran, a stay-at-home mum from Blackburn, Lancashire, said: “I’m glad I had that bit of time with him but it also made the situation much harder.  “They told me he had typical Edwards Syndrome so would pass away before or just after birth, my boy had a lion heart.” “I thought I had done the hard bit when I made the dficult decision to have an abortion, but now it feels ten times worse. I just want other mums to know in case this happens to them. “I had to watch his heartbeat getting slower and watch his le draining out of him. “You just want to keep your children alive. “It was like torture.  She added: “None of the doctors thought he would be born alive. When my partner picked him up after he was born he said ‘his heart is beating’, and they said ‘no way’. “When I took the first tablet they said it would stop the pregnancy, heartbeat and everything, so we expected he wouldn’t be alive when he was born. “They didn’t check for a heartbeat before inducing labour, and I wish they had. I don’t have words for how awful it was.” Edwards Syndrome is a rare condition and most babies with it don’t live to full-term, or die a couple of hours after being born, because they have an extra chromosome, number . The NHS website says the condition can cause a mixture of symptoms, including learning dficulties, heart, respiratory, kidney or gastrointestinal problems.

The level of illness can depend on how much of the extra chromosome patients have, and how many cells carry the copy, so there is full, mosaic or partial Edwards Syndrome. Loran said she was told Kiyo Bleu had ‘typical Edwards Syndrome’. Loran said: “We had already said our goodbyes when we went in on the th, because I’d taken the termination tablet on the sixth. But little Kiyo Bleu Watson was born alive on April  at .pm, weighing g, to the shock of his parents and doctors. They had him blessed and christened in hospital while he was alive. Though glad to have met him, Loran said it was agonising to wait  hours watching their newborn son fade until he died on April  at .am.  After he died little Kiyo Bleu went home to be with Loran, Scott, who works as a labourer, and their other three children for four days. The family spent time with him in a special cot with a cold mattress until he needed to go to a funeral parlour on April  to wait for his funeral. He spent time with his big brother Rocco Watson, six, and sisters Bunni Rose, three, and Romee Beau, two. “It was awful, she said. I can’t get my head around how he survived. “I don’t even have a word for how horrible it feels.

I’ve only had sex with three people in my le and the first two I can barely remember. My friends all say it will all come naturally, but I’m not so sure. How can I find some confidence  What is your view  Have your say in the comment section Coleen saysI’m online dating myself and I’m not even thinking that far ahead to the sex bit. Look, you’re not going to meet him once and jump into bed – you’ve probably never done that before, so why put pressure on yourself  You need to meet a few times and seethat chemistry is there. I think what your friends mean is that when you meet someone you really like, two or three dates down the line, you might have a great kiss and your mind and body will tell you when it’s right to take the next step into the bedroom. If you don’t feel ready, be honest with him. If he’s a nice guy, he’ll get it.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeTwo pensioners who first met when they played Mary and Joseph in their primary school nativity aged just five years old, have struck up a romance  years later. Tony Jackson and Gloria Loukes were friends in the s before going their separate ways aged  and eventually on to have their own families and careers. Gloria, now , organised a school reunion in  which, although Tony didnapost attend, led to the couple and their spouses meeting up in their home town of Sheffield, South Yorkshire. But the pair didnapost see each other again for another  years. In August last year, Tony was going through some old things when he found a picture of Gloria before digging out her phone number from  and ringing to “seeshe was still alive”. From the first call the pair hit it off and have since met up in person more than half a dozen times and spoken on the phone up to six times every day. What do you think  Have your say in comments below  Adding to their fairy-tale romance is the fact Gloria has cherished a heart-shaped, glass piece of jewellery that -year-old Tony gave her all the way back in the mid-s. The couple, who lost their spouses at around the same time in , say they are “excited” about the future and have four trips planned around the UK for later this year. Gloria said: “After my husband died I thought that was it, I didn’t think about ever finding someone  again or even consider it. “But then Tony called and was absolutely lovely. Since then we have got on so well and had such a lovely time together that we want to keep it going.”  The gran-of-one added: “Tony is very clever, which I like, and makes me laugh all the time, which is obviously very important indeed. “I feel very happy with him and lucky to have found him again.” Tony, a granddad-of-, said: “Over the summer I just happened to find this picture of Gloria that I had taken in  with a landline number on it. “I thought I’d try it to seeshe was still alive and there she was. I was delighted to hear her voice and get chatting with her. “In the end, we wanted to seewe were compatible together so she came to see me and it went really well, so it’s gone from there. “We get on very well, Gloria’s a wonderful woman.”  Tony and Gloria were both born and raised in Sheffield, and first met each other aged five in  when they attended Pomona Street School. Shortly after starting school, they were cast as Mary and Joseph in a nativity and it was not long afterwards that Tony gave Gloria the heart-shaped piece of jewellery. He said: “I have no idea where I got it from but I remember liking Gloria an awful lot and I think that’s why I gave it to her.” Gloria added: “It was such a special gt because in those days young girls like me didn’t have jewellery, it just wasn’t as common back then. “So to receive something so beautul was really important to me and I think that’s why I have held on to it all these years.  “And I did always maintain a soft spot for Tony, even though we were very young I liked him a lot.” Fantastic black and white photos show the pair as youngsters, including one school photo in which they can both be seen alongside their classmates. After going their separate ways aged , Gloria went on to become a primary school teacher and moved to Biggin Hill in Kent and Tony became an engineer for BT at stayed in Sheffield. Both married and had children. After than more than half a century passed before they saw each other again, following a school reunion in  that Tony failed to attend.  He said he felt guilty he had not gone and called Gloria, one of the organisers, and apologised for not attending. Tony then invited Gloria and her husband Frank up to have Sunday lunch with him and his we, Jacqueline. By sheer chance, he had a picture taken with both women and noted down Gloria’s landline. After that, it was another  years before he rediscovered the photo while going through old things and rang the number, which he was also able to find among his things. Gloria failed to answer initially but then dialled  and got through to Tony, who has battled cancer, Covid- and Parkinson’s in recent years. She said: “It was wonderful to hear from him again and after only a few weeks we decided to meet up. “It went really well and we haven’t stopped since.” The Mirroraposs newsletter brings you the latest news, exciting showbiz and TV stories, sport updates and essential political information.The newsletter is emailed out first thing every morning, at noon and every evening.

Other staff members, Joris explained, were called aposvisuals,apos who wouldnapost spend much time on the shop floor, but you would see them walking around at regular intervals spraying perfume. They also took care of the modelsapos unorms and anything  that wasnapost for sale.  Then you have the stock room impacts. By now youaposve got the jist of the Abercrombie beauty hierarchy, so youaposve probably guessed how it was determined youaposd work in the stock room, he added. And, lastly you had the overnight team doing the restocking and changing the floor display to make it pristine ready for the morning opening. And, even the shop floor models were ranked by their attractiveness, with the best looking being placed at the front and the slightly less attractive but still model-worthy staff were placed further back. One position, which the TikToker said most people felt was a punishment, was called aposthe rail,apos where one male model and one female model had to dance something which Joris loved to do. I got to move by body the way I wanted and got to chat to someone dferent every hour or so and that was perfect to me, he said. And thataposs how I survived the soul-crushing Abercrombie ranking system for most of my time there.

No matter who youaposre dealing with, everyone deserves to be treated well. Andyouaposre a person who treats people worse because you think theyaposre beneath you, well you deserve it when bad things happen. One man has had that lesson imprinted in memory forever after making a rather bad impression at his job interview. His potential boss has shared the single mistake he made which meant he had no chance of getting the job. On the aposLe Pro Tipsapos forum on Reddit, she warned readers to ensure they treat everyone with respect.  She wrote: Today, a candidate blew his interview in the first  minutes after he entered the building. He was dismissive to the receptionist. She greeted him and he barely made eye contact. She tried to engage him in conversation. Again, no eye contact, no interest in speaking with her. What the candidate did not realize was that the receptionist was actually the hiring manager. She called him back to the conference room and explained how every single person on our team is valuable and worthy of respect. Due to his interaction with the receptionist, the hiring manager did not feel he was a good fit. Thank you for your time but the interview is over.  Be nice to everyone in the building. Lots of people on Reddit agreed that it was essential to ensure you were polite to everyone - which sounds like a no-brainer. One person wrote: BINGO! After a candidate leaves one of the first things those involved in the interview will do is speak to the receptionist and ask them how the interviewee treated them. The person could be the best person for the position butthey treated the receptionist like c***.....THEY ARE DONE! If they treated the receptionist like s*** when on their best behaviour imagine how awful they will treat them once they get the job.  Same goes for any cleaning staff. They are consulted, too. Another shared: I got hired once because I held the door for the janitor coming in with his cart. The receptionist said, thataposs so nice of you.. I said it was just decency, but apparently, she was in the hiring manageraposs ear later that day. The choice was between me, and someone more knowledgeable, but he was a p****... So they went with me. After some questions, the woman confirmed that they did further research into the candidate.

We all know he’s a No  and he’s done a job for us wide of a front three.“He’s had a right good go at that but I think his best position is probably as a nine.“Goal-scoring is where his instincts are.“Considering he’s not played where I believe is his best position, he’s made a big contribution to us, on and off the pitch.“He’s a good character with great personality and he’s a very talented footballer.#As to whether a deal is possible, he continued: “That will be up to us, Reading and Marc to speak about, which we will probably do in the next week or two.“We’ve tentatively spoken about stuff but haven’t really looked at everything overall.“We’ll bring all our ideas to the table and see where we believe all of us are and make decisions going forward about how we want to take it forward.”On the wider recruitment front, Mellon is targeting new faces next season but distanced himself from -year-old Swedish international winger Daleho Irandust, currently at BK Hacken.Mellon also said he#s heard nothing from Ipswich regarding goalkeeper Benjamin Siegrist, out of contract next summer.“We have a lot of people who work very hard at our recruitment,# he said.“They will be putting stuff together to bring to our attention to make Dundee United better.“There are areas in the team where we are a bit light, in certain positions and types of players.“They would need to be of the right profile to come here.“We are actively looking to make it better.“From day one we sat down with the recruitment people and spoke about where we need to improve or whether we can organically improve by bringing on young players.“Is there any of them coming on now that we can bring in “It’s all about how can we move Dundee United forward. How can we get more consistent and grow “There are ongoing conversations about that all the time.“I would expect there will be new faces coming in and we are working on stuff at the minute.“There’s nothing over the line as of yet but there will be new faces coming in.”In terms of potential outgoings, young centre-half Kerr Smith has been attracting interest from down south for as long as he#s been in the first-team picture.This week, however, Aston Villa reportedly stepped up their interest after Manchester United missed out on a deal for the -year-old.Other Premier League sides like Liverpool, Leicester City and Southampton have also taken an interest in the kid defender but Mellon moved quickly to sully the rumours.“Until, and this hasn’t happened, somebody comes to me and says they’re interested in Kerr and want to take him then there’s nothing really happening,# he said.“I haven’t seen it. I’ve not read the papers so there’s nothing happening.#This boy#s ready#: Mark Connolly puts own tough times aside to rave about Dundee United kid Kerr Smith\" title\"##This boy#s ready#: Mark Connolly puts own tough times aside to rave about Dundee United kid Kerr Smith# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-united-mark-connolly-kerr-smith-kilmarnock embed # secretUqbOZjXZg\" data-secret\"UqbOZjXZg\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"“He’s a talented boy. We enjoy having him here and watching him progress.“I’m not surprised there would be interest in a -year-old that’s as good as him.“If the decision comes his or the club’s way then playing or not is a factor that will come into consideration for him, his family and the club.“Nobody has come to myself and given me a decision to make.“If there’s no interest in a -year-old boy playing in the Scottish Premiership you’re kind of wondering why not “Nothing has came to us to even start thinking about.”Mellon says he#ll give kids like Smith and other fringe men opportunities this week in the final two games of their Premiership season.United, currently ninth, take on the seventh-placed Steelmen on Wednesday and head for eighth-placed St Mirren on Sunday to see the campaign out.“I need to give them the opportunity to play to see what they’ve got for us,# Mellon said.“We want to seethere’s something there that can improve us and move us forward.“They’ll get the opportunity to go and do that in the last couple of games.“Apart from finishing seventh, eighth, ninth in the league, that’s all we’ve really sort of got to play for now.“We’ll use the games as best we can to learn as much as we can about the group moving forward.“I want to find out about boys.“Obviously, we want to win games, that goes without saying but there is a bigger picture I need to look at.“I need to learn what players are going to take us forward. Are they going to play “You need to look at what you have in the building before you look at your recruitment.“Some will get the opportunity to go and do that over the next couple of games.”Following Saturday#s - Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Hibs at Hampden, Mellon reflects on the Tangerines# first season back in the top flight as a successful one.He believes Premiership safety and an appearance at the national stadium is a very good base to build on.He commented: “We, obviously, had to come into it and set a base to try and work forward from.“We’ve set a very good base. To better this is going to have to be a cup final and top six.“That’s a very big target for us but we’ll go and attack next season when it comes around.🎥 Hear from manager Micky Mellon and Marc McNulty after this evening#s Scottish Cup defeat.#UnitedTogether pic HxwlCcEmdash Dundee United FCMay , “We need a rest.

journey times between Aberdeen and the central belt by more than  minutes are on track to be completed in five years# time.Major improvements are to be carried out to the East Coast Main Line as part of the Aberdeen City Region Deal at a cost of £ million.There have been repeated calls for the line to be upgraded for more than a decade, with business chiefs claiming shorter journey times will lead to more business opportunities and encourage new visitors.Initial plans to upgrade the stretch through the Usan junction were ditched after it emerged it would save just two minutes.But proposals for wider upgrades along the route are expected to deliver far more radical results.A series of proposals including line speed enhancements, signalling improvements and more passing loops could cut  minutes from journeys between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, to two hours and  minutes.Eight minutes would be saved on journeys to Glasgow, down to two hours and  minutes.And trips to Dundee would be three minutes quicker, at one hour and  minutes.Transport Scotland had earmarked  for completion of the work, and a new report has revealed the project is progressing on schedule.An options selection process relating to stations along the route is also expected to be completed in July, and is described as #progressing well#.The report reads: #Indicative planning work has provided assurance that the scheme is deliverable for the December  timetable change.#The Scottish Government has committed £ million Scottish Government to#NR [Network Rail] is currently transitioning to a new project governance system – Projects Accelerated in a Controlled Environment# which is intended to replace Governance for Railway Investment Projectswith more streamlined#From summer  the Aberdeen to central belt project will be moving from the strategic development and project selection of PACE to the project development and design stage.#The update on the project was welcomed by Aberdeen and Grampian Chamber of Commerce, which has been leading calls for rail upgrades.The organisation#s policy manager Shane Taylor said: “Although Covid- has presented many immediate economic challenges, the pandemic has also illustrated the importance of continuing to invest in critical aspects of our region#s resilience, like our connectivity, which will define how we recover.“With this in mind, it#s encouraging to see that the Aberdeen to central belt rail project remains on track, as the project will be crucial to reducing journey times and enabling the decarbonisation of our rail network in the future. Keeping our focus firmly on the delivery of major infrastructure projects like this one is the best way to ensure a resurgent north-east economy in the long-term.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2021/04/demographics-300x180.jpg class=attachment-part-medium size-part-medium wp-post-image ","title":"coronavirus in scotland track the spread in these charts and maps2001","story":".dct-cta@-webkit-keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate@keyframes dctSpinnertransform:rotate%transform:rotate.dct-cta__title.dct-cta__content p.dct-cta__content p:not.dct-cta__content p:last-child.dct-cta__label.dct-cta__input.dct-cta__input::-webkit-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::-moz-placeholder.dct-cta__input:-ms-input-placeholder.dct-cta__input::placeholder.dct-cta__label:hover.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__label:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__input:hover,.dct-cta__input:focus.dct-cta__input,.dct-cta__btn .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn.dct-cta__btn:disabled.dct-cta__btn:not.dct-cta__btn:not:hover.dct-cta__btn:not:hover,.dct-cta__btn:not:focus.dct-cta__btn-text.dct-cta__btn:before .stransition:all cubic-bezier .s.dct-cta__btn-loadingborder-top:px solid #fffborder-radius:%width:pxheight:pxbox-sizing:border-box-webkit-animation:dctSpinner .s linear infiniteanimation:dctSpinner .s linear infinite.dct-cta--signup.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--signup__dialogs.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--success.dct-cta--signup__dialog--error.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__grid.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__title.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and @media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap+.dct-cta__content@supports or.dct-cta__flex:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup__dialog.dct-cta--signup__dialog--js-active.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta__image-wrap.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__image-wrap,.dct-cta--subscribe .dct-cta__content@media only screen and .dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__flex.dct-cta--subscribe--contained .dct-cta__image-wrap@media only screen and @supports or.dct-cta__grid:after.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__label,.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__btn.dct-cta--signup .dct-cta__gridgrid-template-columns:fr minmaxgrid-gap:.rem .remWe#ve put together a collection of daily updated charts and maps to track the coronavirus crisis in Scotland. The table below shows an at-a-glance view of the situation in each local authority. It shows new reported cases and deaths in the last day, as well as the total cases in each area since the pandemic began. After a second wave over winter, most areas of the country are starting to see figures fall again.The proportion of people who test positive every day was trending downward since December.The chart below shows local positivity rates. This is now a key metric that is considered when putting each area into tiers. The colour scales refer to the potential levels recommended by the World Health Organisation.Another key metric is the rate of cases per , people. The chart below shows the seven day rate in each local authority. Similar to the chart above, this chart is also colour coded by the potential levels as recommended by the WHO.In the early stages of the pandemic, cases were more concentrated in older generations. In the last few months this has shted towards cases being more prevalent in younger people – however, cases are declining in the more vulnerable age groups as the vaccine rollout progresses.As the number of daily new cases reduces, the cumulative totals for the health board areas become less important. The heatmap below shows the number of new cases by health board area.The chart below shows the daily number of deaths after a positive test as well as the cases where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certicate.The heatmap below shows the age demographics of the people who have lost their lives to the virus. The chart below shows a daily snapshot of the number of people in hospital and ICU with Covid-.

Of course, this has generated a massive amount of data which will help our scientists with important conservation work, but it also shows how many of us have turned to nature after what has been a very dficult  months.We need every voice raised to stand up for nature. The wildle that brings us so much interest and solace is now just a fraction of what should be there.Big Garden Birdwatch has shown that people across Scotland have a real passion for wildle.

One of the highlights from last year’s event included celebrity supporters dressing up as much-loved characters to recreate tea party scenes from the world of film. Phyllis Logan was Mary Poppins, music producer Naughty Boy was Jay Gatsby, Emma Barton was Holly Golightly and Jess and Natalya Wright were Alice in Wonderland and the Queen of Hearts.Families with dementia have been adversely affected by the lockdown for just over a year. Care home visiting restrictions, the closure of support and respite services and the resulting social isolation and loneliness has disproportionately affected people living with dementia and their family carers.Whilst Time for a Cuppa will be slightly dferent this year, we know dementia support is needed more than ever. We are so grateful to all of our fundraisers who will be whipping up treats, enthusiasm, funds and giving their time for others – in a socially distanced way, of course – in what will be a very special and important Time for a Cuppa.For more information about Time for a Cuppa and how to host a tea party with our free fundraising pack, visit the dementiauk.org timeforacuppa webpage.Dr Hilda Hayo, Chief Admiral Nurse and Chief Executive Officer of Dementia UK."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead competitions galore","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past  dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland’s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days. The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best, serving their customers.Re-opening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps to support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain.Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail ConsortiumThe reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints.Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers.Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.Tracey Gilbert, Usdaw deputy isional officer for ScotlandSir,Oxfam’s shops in Argyll and Bute have an urgent need for volunteers to help deal with an anticipated deluge of donations as they prepare to re-open from Monday April .Sales from the first day of trading following the re-opening of its English and Welsh shops were up  per cent on  figures, with it being the most successful Monday ever sales-wise for the organisation outwith Christmas periods.Money raised by the dedicated staff and volunteers in Oxfam#s shops in Dunoon and Rothesay helps fight poverty and injustice around the world providing people with lesaving essentials like clean water and soap as well as the hope of a better future.We know from the last lockdown that people will have taken the chance to have a good declutter and we’re anticipating a deluge of generous donations.Volunteers are asked to give as little as a few hours a week of their time and can take up a range of vital roles, from serving customers to sorting donations and arranging window displays.Each shop typically relies on a team of  dedicated volunteers and one or two staff, with more than , volunteers required across the country.As well as volunteers, Oxfam stores are also appealing for good quality donations.Protecting staff, volunteers and customers from Covid- remains Oxfam’s priority, with shop teams continuing to implement strict protocol, including social distancing, readily available hand sanitiser, masks and gloves for staff, screens at tills, regular and frequent cleaning, closed changing rooms and encouraging contactless payment.In advance of shops re-opening, people are invited to register their interest online via www.oxfam.org.uk # just click on #get involved#.Tom Richardson, Oxfam interim head of retailSir,The demands placed on Scotland’s health service by the pandemic have intensied pleas for an increase in funding for Scottish NHS.NHS funding in Scotland comes from the block grant from Westminster. If huge sums of Scottish taxpayers’ money were not being used to pay Scotland’s share of renewing and maintaining Britain’s nuclear submarine fleet, there would be funds available to properly support the Scottish NHS. This will only be possible when Scotland is independent once more.Susan Swain, Dunbar"},{"url":null,"title":"self help bike workshop opens in tayvallich","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

So, it’s an easier morning round for us crofters with only the daft pigs to feed, who long ago foraged every root, acorn and pine-cone from their sizeable woodland.Their little forest is perfectly, porcinely ploughed, but they must still be finding some nourishment there as they seem less frantic at feeding-time, pausing their grubbling and guzzling for the occasional scratch and cuddle.The let-up in winter feeding has allowed much-needed attention to be given to the now stuffed-full Polycrub where every speck of soil, every hanging beam has been usefully employed in the mission to feed the family entirely from its harvest.Raspberry canes, lemon, orange and cherry trees should keep rickets at bay, while the plethora of weird and wonderful ieties of carrots, potatoes, asparagus, and squashes will nourish us throughout the season and beyond.Our newbie attempts to live off the land mirror the much more experienced efforts of families throughout theand breadth of this peninsula and in the village beyond. Thanks to those techie neighbours who set up email networks and social media groups there is a fantastic bank of information and expertise shared locally.Whether you want to learn how to plant oak trees, acquire foraging skills or find out how to run your home on renewable energy, somebody local has been there, done it and is happy to point you in the right direction.Over the last few months this valuable mine of knowledge and enthusiasm for environmental projects has been formalised into the Tayvallich Sustainability Plan, a  for sharing information and taking action to create a more sustainable community.The plan has grown organically from a pilot scheme run through the winter months with Keep Scotland Beautul to a website, action plan and monthly activities.Open to everyone with an interest in achieving a healthy, sustainable future for the village and its surroundings, the plan will work on the whole gambit: from food growing to flood mitigation foraging to forestry and heat pumps to bike pumps # a new cycle repair work-stand has been installed outside the village shop.Joining the online meetings throughout the winter, I was amazed to see not just the number of locals involved, but also the extraordinary talents and interests they share.We only entrenched ourselves full time on this wild wee bit of Argyll a month or two before lockdown so we’re not well-kent faces and, likewise, the faces of many villagers I’ve only ever seen strangely pixellated thanks to my dodgy connection to the Zoom meetings.Hopefully the same is true for wi throughout the area and that my, now ubiquitous, Zoom-accompanying glass of wine has stayed safely out of shot."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 30 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Retailers in Scotland have invested tens of millions of pounds on safety measures including plexiglass screens, queue management systems, social distancing signage and floor markings, better ventilation, cleaning and hygiene. Shop workers have ensured the nation was supplied and fed throughout the past thirteen dficult months.The reopening of non-essential shops and ability of food-to-go retailers to resume welcoming customers in-store will mark a crucial milestone for Scottish retail and the wider supply chain. Retail is Scotland#s largest private sector employer. So-called non-essential stores have been compelled to close in Scotland for  consecutive days.The SRC and Usdaw encourage shoppers to:Across Scotland, thousands of shops which have been shuttered for four long months are looking forward to getting back to doing what they do best — serving their customers.Reopening is good news for our economy, for jobs and for our local communities. It has never been more important to play our part in keeping our towns, cities and retail destinations vibrant.Every purchase from a shop helps support jobs in local retail and throughout the supply chain. Retailers and their colleagues continue to work around the clock to maintain a safe shopping experience, so customers can have the confidence toto their favourite stores.If we all follow the necessary physical distancing and hygiene measures and show consideration to those around us, including shop staff who are doing a dficult job, then everyone will be better off.The reopening of stores on Monday offers a leline for many retailers. That is good news in terms of helping to safeguard jobs, but the virus is still out there.We expect employers to conduct full risk assessments, follow the agreed guidance and ensure that customers are fully informed of the necessary safety measures.Shoppers need to play their part in helping to limit the spread of the virus and avoid further lockdowns by following the rules and respecting staff.Regrettably, throughout this appalling pandemic, incidents of abuse towards shop workers doubled and Covid safety measures have now become signicant flashpoints. Abuse should never be part of the job and shop workers – who played a vital role in getting food and medicine into our homes during the pandemic – deserve our thanks and respect.In January, the Scottish Parliament unanimously voted for a ground-breaking new law to protect shop workers. Usdaw campaigned for many years to secure these legal protections and we will continue to work hard to ensure that shop workers are protected and treated with the respect they deserve.The national charity for older people is encouraging people to get moving every day next month as part of a new fundraising activity challenge.Throughout May, Age Scotland is asking people across the country to Spring into Action to help support older people in Scotland.Fundraisers can take part however they choose, but the most important thing is to make sure they are active every day.All funds raised by Spring into Action participants will go towards Age Scotland#s vital services, including the national friendship line, which offers a place older people can turn tothey are in need of support, comfort and reassurance or even just missing a friendly voice.Running and walking events have always been a great way to help raise vital funds and, even with many regular events unfortunately cancelled over the past year, we#ve been overwhelmed by the kindness and generosity shown by fundraisers still going above and beyond.We hope to see as many people as possible taking up our challenge to Spring into Action this May. With nights getting lighter and better weather on the horizon, this is a great excuse to get out and about and support a worthy cause at the same time.#Whether you run one mile, walk five, or design your own challenge, your fundraising efforts will be making a real dference for older people in Scotland.#The money you raise will fund vital services like our friendship line. Every week we receive hundreds of calls from older people looking for support. Many are lonely and isolated and just want to hear a friendly voice.

Online records showed his birthplace as #Inchial Argileshire#, which turned out to be the parish of Glenorchy and Inishail at the head of Loch Awe.Alexander McNab was born there to Alexander senior and Margaret McNab in  — one of a family of three brothers and four sisters — and moved south to Burnley in Lancashire in the s. In Lancashire in , he married Janet Wardrope, who came from Milngavie outside Glasgow, and they went on to have  children.Going back a few generations, Clare#s research has traced Alexander#s great grandfather, John McNab, born in Kilbrandon in the area around Loch Melfort in .His son Peter, born around , went on to farm in Connel and is recorded in the  census as an -year-old, farming  acres at South Ledaig, though is described as a #smith# in an earlier record.Born in , Peter#s son Alexander grew up to work in farming around Glenorchy. In the  census he is recorded as a ploughman at Barbreck.#Our# Alexander seems to have been a blacksmith when he moved from Argyll to Burnley to start a new le.Sadly, two of Alexander and Janet#s family died as young children.Later, however, they found themselves — like so many other families — caught up in the horrors of the First World War.They lost three sons — Andrew, aged , missing in action,  Alex, , missing in action,  and John, , missing in action,  — during the war.The grief the family must have borne is unimaginable. The boys# names are recorded on three separate First World War memorials in Belgium and France.Clare said: #What a tragedy losing your sons. Andrew, Alex and John were brothers of my great grandma, Grace McNab Bridge.#Alexander died in  at the age of , after being hit by a tramcar in Blackpool during the blackout. He was living with daughter Grace and her family at the time. A short newspaper report from the time describes him as a #retired blacksmith#.Clare was born in Blackpool and moved to Tees-side, via a spell in Dumfries, through her husband David#s employment.Though her great grandmother Grace passed away in , Clare believes she can detect echoes of the past in her own family today.She explained: #My son, who is in army, has just trained in music and learnt the bagpipes.#Little bits keep popping up. My other son is into blacksmithing, which is also in the family.#And while she has never visited Argyll, Clare would love to at some point once Covid restrictions have eased.#I had a look at images of Loch Awe and have been reading up about the area. It looks amazing.#If you have any other information on this branch of the McNab family, please email editor@campbeltowncourier and this will be passed on to Clare."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files april 30 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A big decision has been swept under the carpet.#The budget was reduced by £,, from £, to £,.Douglas Hendry, executive director of customer services, said: #Our process is not to fund routes where there is alternative transport available or where there are less than , people travelling annually.#TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPiper#s march wins prizeThe Campbeltown piper who won a competition to compose a tune to mark a battle in which many of his comrades fought was presented with his prize on Tuesday # the battle#s rd anniversary.Mr George McIntyre from Meadowburn won a competition run by the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders to compose a   march in memory of the Battle of Longstop Hill in .On Tuesday, Longstop Day, Major Hamish Clarkof the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders travelled to Campbeltown to present George with a specially engraved quaich at a ceremony at the Argyll Hotel.Many Kintyre men fought at the battle which was one of the decisive moments in the Second World War against the Germans in North Africa.Major Duncan McMillan, who won the Military Medal at the battle, attended the ceremony along with many of George#s other old army friends.Before he handed the quaich to George, Major Clark said: #I really can#t think of anyone more appropriate to have won the competition than George McIntyre himself.#If George had not been taken prisoner in  he may well have fought at Longstop.#Receiving the quaich, George said: #It gives me great honour to achieve this.#Then Mr Ian McKerral from Kintyre and District Pipe Band gave the first public performance of the tune.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe end of the road for PaulPaul McCartney, who is at the moment staying at High Park Farm, Campbeltown, has just made one giant step forward towards severing all his connections with the other three Beatles.John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr abandoned their appeal against a High Court order on Monday, putting the affairs of their company, Apple, in the hands of a receiver. The three now face a legal costs bill estimated at £,.Mr Morris Finer, QC for John, George, Ringo and Apple, told the appeal court on Monday that they now considered it was in the common interest to explore ways of allowing Paul to free himself from the partnership by agreement.Mr David Hurst QC on behalf of Paul said: #He will most willingly enter into the proposed negotiations to achieve his freedom from the partnership by consent rather than by court action.#Well, it looks very much like the end of the #long and winding road# to quote a well known McCartney ballad.What does Paul himself feel about the rise and fall of the Beatles Two Courier men drove up to High Park Farm — which has a long and decidedly bumpy road leading to it — to find out what the man in the centre of it all felt about things.Apart from being obviously excited about his latest and most important success, Paul did not like saying anything about the matter.Though very polite and friendly, he made it quite clear that he does not see any point in giving interviews or saying anything remotely sensational.After ten years of being harried and hustled by journalists and photographers never having a minute#s peace to himself always having been the centre of attraction never having been able to pop in to the #local#, is it any wonder that Paul is determined to live as quietly as possible He seemed as happy as a sand-boy, out there in the wilds.When we approached him, he had obviously been brushing down one of his horses because he still held a horse brush in his hand.His we Linda looked the essence of happiness as her golden hair mirrored the warm sunshine. The children yelled and gurgled contentedly and even Martha, the English sheepdog, seemed happy.The farm house itself has been extensively renovated, a new roof having been constructed and the farm work appears to be progressing normally.Paul himself has changed. Outwardly at any rate. Gone is the Beatle mop, the style which was copied the whole word over. Gone is the boyish grin, which once sent screaming thousands into ecstasy.What has taken the place of these characteristics  Paul now sports a beard the hair remains longish but it is brushed back, revealing the full extent of his forehead the smile is no longer boyish.The former bass-guitarist song-writer with the most influential and certainly most famous foursome the world has ever known has changed.Paul will probably continue to compose such brilliant songs as Maybe I#m Amazed and Another Day but to millions of people, from Campbeltown to Honolulu, pop music will certainly never be the same again.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and flashesThere would be some fluttering this week among the ladies in the town who are liable to serve on a jury, summonses to appear on the occasion of a forthcoming jury trial having been issued to  ladies and  gentlemen.

If you are taking a long-term view then a garden full of reliable flowering shrubs is also an option.Whatever garden you have, watering and weeding are the key watchwords for May. It is essential to water newly planted fruit trees, roses and shrubs regularly to help their root systems get established.It is also the time of year when many plants# demand for water increases as they start their major growth period. Top watering tips include – every time you plant something, water it in well, make a moat of soil round newly planted plants so that water doesn#t run off and goes to the roots, water pots and containers so that water appears right to the top of the pot and get a water butt.If you have a drainpipe, you have a natural water supply so a simple garden solution for May is to ensure that you have adequate water storage. If you buy and fit a water butt, it will provide you with water for the garden in an environmentally friendly way and on a regular basis.Annual weeds will be popping up now, so weeding borders once a week to prevent weed seedlings establishing is a good idea. The problem with the most common weeds such as nettles, dandelions and bindweed, is that they are very, very tough. They can continue to grow in conditions that make most garden plants simply fade away – and they do that, in part, by using the moisture, nutrients and light of the plants around them.A great plant to get you into the summer gardening spirit is the pretty petunia – perfect for containers and hanging baskets and a great choice for instant colour. It can flower all summer long, providing you deadhead regularly, and comes in a iety of colours to suit any garden palette.Petunias are also available in dferent blooms including single, double, ruffled or smooth petals. They can be striped, veined or solid in colour and most sold today are hybrids developed for specic design purposes such as fragrance.They need full sun and can#t tolerate frost but can grow in a wide range of soils and thrive in multipurpose compost when planted in containers.Keeping on top of garden maintenance is crucial in May. The garden is coming alive so there is plenty to keep you busy.

Their father Stephen, aged , is in his th year of service with the crew.His father Robert is now aged  and, before retiring, he served  years and his father, the late Robert Scally senior, served for  years.The sea is in the Scally family blood Stephen senior, who is also the Campbeltown harbour master, was a fisherman, as was his father.#My grandfather was a fisherman and he met my grandmother at Mallaig, where she was one of the herring lasses who followed the fishing fleet as it followed the herring around the coast,# said Stephen senior. #Her family came from Peterhead and all her brothers were fishermen.#None of the latest generation of Scallys to serve is a fisherman.Between them, the Scally family have served on Campbeltown leboats City of Glasgow, City of Glasgow II, Walter and Margaret Cooper and Ernest and Mary Shaw.Stephen Scally senior and Robert Scally are both recipients of the institute#s bronze medal for bravery and both are qualied coxswains.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOGerman giant to call in the Wee ToonGermany#s flagship passenger cruise ship is to visit Campbeltown next summer with up to  passengers on board, it was revealed this week.The Hamburg-based MS Europa will be docking in the town for six hours on Wednesday July  next year, during a voyage around the British Isles.The cruiser, owned by German shipping firm Hapag-Lloyd, is  metres high and nearly  metres long.It carries between  and  passengers.It will dock in the loch around midday and leave for Oban at pm. Campbeltown Harbour Office said that the Europa was #arguably the biggest boat to come into Campbeltown for a long time#.The chairperson of Campbeltown Community Council, Mrs Nancie Smith, hoped a special gala day could be organised to mark the ship#s visit.She said: #This is an opportunity we should grasp with both hands. I anticipate there will be some form of civic entertainment laid on.#Mrs Smith added that she hoped many shops in the centre of town would not close for the half day to make the visitors feel welcome.She told the Courier: #It is important that the visitors see the town looking at its best and we hope this will be supported by all the businesses and shops which will stay open for business that day.#The local director of Argyll, the Isles, Loch Lomond, Stirling and the Trossachs Tourist Board, Mr Bruce Urquhart, hailed the Europa#s planned visit as a great opportunity for Campbeltown.FIFTY YEARS AGOFarmer#s heroic effort to save barnFire dealt a cruel blow to a local farmer yesterday afternoon, for the second time in three years.As fire fighting units raced from Campbeltown, a barn at Low Tirfergus Farm near Drumlemble was ablaze from end to end. Flames were fanned by a fresh easterly breeze.And despite a heroic effort by the farmer, Mr Roderick Morrison, son-in-law of the farm#s owner Mr A Barker, the fire had a firm hold by the time the fire brigade arrived.The alarm was raised by Mr Morrison#s we who alerted him.Armed with a pitchfork, Mr Morrison tried to separate the blazing straw, which was being used as feeding, from the rest of the barn#s contents, but it was in vain.Firemen had to jump clear as the roof caved in with a tremendous crash.The straw inside the barn was totally destroyed.The £ barn was erected three years ago after  tons of hay and  tons of straw were destroyed in a blaze at the same farm.It stood on its own, some distance from the other farm buildings.Labour back in control – by one seatLabour retained control of Campbeltown Town Council at Tuesday#s municipal elections, though they lost one seat to the Progressives.The composition of the council now reads: Labour nine seats, Progressive eight seats.Provost Daniel McKinven and Councillor Edward Scragg, who formerly sat under the Independent Socialist and SBP banners respectively, fought the contest as Progressives. Both were re-elected.And -year old William Crossan, of Kinloch Road, Campbeltown, became the youngest member ever to sit in the council chambers.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOCoal strikeAttention should be paid to the announcement in our advt. columns regarding the pressure of gas from the local works, special arrangements commencing on Saturday night with the object of conserving the stock of coal.A coal laden schooner, carrying about  tons of household coal, which arrived here just at the beginning of the coal strike and was prohibited from discharging by the customs authorities, had the embargo removed this week, the cargo being transferred to one of the local coal merchants.One hundred tons dished out in half-cwt lots, which is the household allowance for a week, will help a bit to keep the home fires burning.The coal fight drags on without the smallest sign of either side giving way. Apparently the nation will have to suffer much more before a settlement is reached, and unfortunately there is no very clear guarantee that even a settlement of the coal dispute would restore us to anything like prosperity.Every minute of the clock-round stocks are being reduced, andthe dispute lasts much longer, the miners will produce a general lock-out of their fellow-workers, which will have all the dire effects of a general strike without any of its heroics. It is a deplorable situation."},{"url":null,"title":"leader may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That much is obvious from her work at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, as well as performances in bands including Rhuvaal, one of Scotland#s fastest rising young traditional groups.It is moving that Alex chose to use that talent not only to pay tribute to Robert Black, someone who inspired her passion, but to raise money to help with the costs of operating the helipad named in his memory.We#re sure it#s not the last we#ll hear about Alex#s career in music.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday joanne","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Any forward player will tell you that. If you have a terrible game and score a goal or play fantastic and not score ndash you are judged on your goals as a forward.ldquoHopefully, I will get another goal but I need to make sure I am in the team.

I loved it with East Kilbride and Gala Fairydean Rovers ndash it is great and you love those big moments in competitions.Paton moved from Dublin to East Lothian after signing for Hibs around his th birthday.He lived with Helen Leslie and her two sons, Darren and Jonathan, off Tranentrsquos Waterloo Road and attended Ross High School, where he studied physical education, English and sports leadership.The striker was quick to praise both the family and the school for helping him develop. He said: ldquoThey took me in asI was part of their family.ldquoThey were absolutely fantastic to me and made me feel so welcome.ldquoI went for dinner with them and they were brilliant.ldquoIn my first year, I spoke to Sean McPartlin, education and welfare officer, and he askedI wanted to do something. I agreed to it and they said I would train some days.ldquoIt is the best thing I ever did.That saw Paton ide his time between attending school and training at Hibernian Training Centre at East Mains on the outskirts of Ormiston.The -year-old spent two years at the secondary school and told Courier Sport how much he enjoyed the experience. He added: ldquoIt was brilliant ndash the best thing I ever did, honestly.ldquoI was not too keen going to school at that age with football andI had not then I would not have made many friends. The amount of people I met through school was unbelievable.Paul Reynolds, headteacher of the Tranent secondary school, said: ldquoNot only was Ruari a standout footballer, he was a true gentleman.ldquoHe was always extremely polite and his positive attitude was infectious.

Itrsquos named after Saint Fillan and the healing pool associated with him was their next destination. Izzy pulled Bess into a minor road and found a parking place.ldquoItrsquos not far, she said, pointing to a sign that said Holy Pool.Finn raised his eyebrows, giving her a sceptical look her concept of not far was dferent to his!ldquoNo, really, this time it isnrsquot, she assured him. ldquoThe pool is just over there, a very short walk through the trees.The morning was lting and Izzy wandered to a nearby small hillock to take in the view. The mountain tops were still mostly hidden under blankets of mist, but small breaks in the cloud were giving tantalising glimpses of Ben More and Ben Lui.Finn joined his aunt.She spoke to her nephew while looking out to the landscape: ldquoA strath is a river valley, Finn, and the river here flows to Loch Dochart. This is Strathfillan, itrsquos named after the saint of that name who came and settled here to preach his religion, before Scotland even existed.ldquoYou mean the saint whose magic healing stones we saw at the mill in Killin Izzy nodded with a very pleased smile, happy hersquod remembered.ldquoYes, thatrsquos him. This part of the river is called Fillanrsquos Water, itrsquos where the healing pool is.Finn was impatient: ldquoLetrsquos go there now, I want to swim in it!They walked through a small wood of twisted birch trees, their leaves lightly touched by the yellow of autumn. The moment Finn entered the wood, he could sense the place had a mysterious air to it. The path zigzagged down to the river and within a couple of minutes they reached the edge of the pool.It wasnrsquot quite what he had expected: a bulge in the river, where the flow of the peaty water slowed, making a deep and calm natural basin. Finn stared at the deep brown water, it was too dark to see anything underneath the surface. It had an almost eerie feeling to it, yet at the same time was quietly inviting.ldquoThis is a place of myth making and history, Izzy said as she sat by the riverbank to set up her stove. Soon its hissing filled the air. She sipped her coffee, waiting for Finn to join her. He took an apple from her rucksack and sat next to her. He wanted to know about this place.ldquoIt was probably a sacred place even before St Fillan and Christianity came here, she said. She explained how the early Celts venerated water and places such as this were associated with their gods and of the spirituality within nature itself.Then she told him stories about St Fillan of how his ox was killed by a wolf, but that afterwards the wolf ed. The saint forgave the creature and to make amends it agreed to be yoked and pull the plough that had been the job of the ox.Finn spoke up: ldquoBut the wolf didnrsquot do anything wrong, surely  It was a wolf after all and the ox was prey, itrsquos what wolves do.ldquoThatrsquos true, Finn, but it is a tale made to show how miraculous his god was. There were many of them. Another was that St Fillan had a bell that could magically fly and also his left arm could shine in the dark, giving him light to read and write at night.ldquoHe sounds more like a superhero, remarked Finn.Izzy chuckled: ldquoYeah, I suppose that was the idea, it was a way of showing people the power of god and of course people at the time really believed these stories. St Fillanrsquos arm bone became a relic called the Mayne, and there is a story that it was taken to Bannockburn on the orders of Robert the Bruce to help him win the battle.Finn knew about Robert the Bruce and wanted to hear the tale of the Mayne. Izzy told it with humour, how the arm bone appeared miraculously, to the surprise of the abbot, who had been afraid to bring it in case it got lost.Finn looked at the pool: ldquoSo according to these stories, he used his powers to make the water here magical ldquoYep, said Izzy, drinking the last of her coffee. ldquoItrsquos mostly forgotten now, but for hundreds of years this was a place of pilgrimage where people came to be cured. The water was said to cure people of mental health problems. She explained the bizarre ritual of how people were submerged in the pool and given the task of finding stones from the river bed, then spent a night tied up in the nearby priory.Finn laughed out loud at the image of it all.Well, I donrsquot believe the stories, said Finn, ldquobut Irsquod still like to swim in the pool and seeI can find some stones.Izzy knew she would have to go in with him. She had brought their swimming gear and towels just in case, and soon they were howling and shrieking as they lowered themselves into the cold water. Within a minute, their bodies numbed to it and they began to swim.Trees lined both banks and they got a good view of the modern bridge further up the river. Finn watched as cars, tour buses and campervans sped over it, passing without a glance.He stayed in the water longer than his aunt, swimming in circles, then exploring the far side of the river. He managed to get three pebbles from the shallower section of the pool on its eastern edge. As he emerged shivering, the sun suddenly broke through the clouds, giving welcome and timely warmth as he dried himself.ldquoI get it now, said Finn, laughing. ldquoYou actually have to be mad to go in there in the first place!He studied the stones in his hand, then looked up: ldquoI know a story about Robert the Bruce.He told his story wrapped in a large towel, his hair still wet and dripping. It was the story of Bruce and the spider, and he told it beautully, under the shade of the birch trees next to the ancient healing pool. The only interruption was birdsong. Now Izzy was the listener and Finn the storyteller. It was an incredibly special moment.ldquoItrsquos a story about not giving up, explained Finn after hersquod finished telling it. ldquoMaybe it didnrsquot happen exactly that way, but itrsquos still got truth in it. He gave his aunt a big smile.His words spoke directly to her, in a way he wouldnrsquot understand. She glanced towards the trees for a moment, then ed Finnrsquos big smile.ldquoFantastic telling, Finn. And you know what  One of the battles he was defeated in took place just over there, at a place called Dalrigh, the field of the king. She pointed to beyond the bridge. ldquoHe was being hunted by his enemies and nearly got killed in the battle. At least he escaped with his le to later meet the spider! According to legend, he threw his sword into a small loch as he fled. His followers did the same and itrsquos been called Lochan nam Arm ever since, which means loch of the weapons. Some say Brucersquos sword still lies in the mud there, which is why people also call it the Loch of the Sword.Finn was excited by this connection. He wanted to see the loch, maybe he could even find the sword! Hersquod once been to Bannockburn visitor centre, it had been a fun day out. But here, history felt so much closer, more real, although he couldnrsquot put into words why.Izzy agreed they could have lunch at Lochan nam Arm. As she packed up, Finn stood by the waterrsquos edge and dropped one of the pebbles back into the pool. He watched as the circular ripples expanded on the calm surface, finally vanishing. He did the same with the second pebble, again watching the ripples the splash had made.Then he spoke, while still studying the water.ldquoMy dad once told me that le is a stone thrown into the water: it leaves ripples long after it has vanished.Izzy froze, saying nothing in case she chose the wrong words.Finn looked at the third stone still in his hand. Instead of throwing it into the water, he hurled it into the wood. It bounced off the trunk of a birch tree, then fell into the undergrowth.ldquoBut he was wrong because some stones just vanish, like that one, thatrsquos all they do, because they are not worth anything. Finnrsquos mood had suddenly changed.ldquoI hated that stone, he said with anger in his voice.Izzy stood up. ldquoFinn, she said softly, holding out her arms, offering a hug.He just turned and walked up the path towards the car, picking up a stick and hitting the trees with it.ldquoI hate him, I hate him, he screamed.Izzyrsquos stomach sank. Her mind raced over what had happened, what had been the trigger, was it something she had said Then she realised.She walked up the path and found Finn by the car, looking out to the mountains which now framed the near horizon all around them.ldquoYou OK, sweetie  You want to talk Finn shook his head.ldquoI want to phone my mum, he eventually replied.ldquoOf course, therersquos a phone at Tyndrum, just down the road. Letrsquos seewe can get hold of her, it will be nearly lunchtime where she is, so maybe she will be free.Finn noticed the sign for Dalrigh, then minutes later they arrived at Tyndrum.Luckily, Finnrsquos mum was able to come to the phone.As Finn spoke with his mum, Izzy saw Ewen pull up at the petrol station. He was in a dferent car and wearing a jacket with a hood half pulled over his face, but she knew it was him. He was being very careful, as shersquod asked him to be. She didnrsquot know how much hersquod seen and heard by the pool.How to tell him shersquod decided it may be best to abandon the whole trip, take Finn back home and wait there for his mum and stepdad to . It just felt too risky and she was worried about Finn. She knew Ewen would be devastated.Finn hung up and seemed happier after the call.ldquoI was thinking we might head back to your home today, Finn. You know, with lights and TV and normal stuff, said Izzy with a smile and a wink.Finnrsquos reaction wasnrsquot what she expected.ldquoWhy, aunty  Irsquom sorry I got angry, but Irsquom OK now. You promised me an adventure to Loch Ness, why are you giving up and breaking your promise So they walked to Lochan nam Arm. Izzy told the story of Brucersquos escape from the MacDougalls and they both made lunch together by a patch of late flowering foxgloves. Some walkers on the West Highland Way passed them, but mostly they had the loch side to themselves.Finn didnrsquot find the sword of Robert the Bruce, of course.

Not all animals are the same some cats and dogs enjoy noise and excitement, but to others this would be very stressful.Others like peace and quiet ndash but to some, being left quiet and alone is stressful.I think most of us are aware that sudden, unusual noises can frighten pets for example, thunderstorms and fireworks. These are sounds which are strange to your pet and can result in a great deal of stress.In a recent survey carried out by the PDSA,  per cent of owners said their pet was scared of fireworks. The main signs the owners reported were cowering and hiding, trembling and shaking, disinterest in food and barking.Pets left alone either at home or in a cattery or kennel, which are unusual occurrences, can result in severe stress, as the pet feels abandoned by their family.Bringing in a new pet or moving home can also feel terrying for a pet which is used to constancy. Sometimes the dynamics of the pets within a home can change and one or more pet can feel threatened.At Dunedin Vets, at the beginning of lockdown, we saw many problems, especially with cats who were not used to their owners being at home all the time.Cats are notoriously sensitive to change. They may hide their stress but it can manest in other ways.This can include bladder problems and over-grooming and itching.Please contact your vet for adviceyou feel your pet requires some help to overcome their stress-related problems.It is wonderful to be out and about in the spring sunshine, albeit it is a bit chilly at the moment.Remember, there are a few hazards to avoid when walking your dog.Do not throw sticks for them to catch or retrieve. These can cause terrible injuriesthe dog runs onto them and injuries occur in their mouth or, as I have seen, penetrate their skin and damage structures in their necks.Last month, we mentioned the collie dog who was chasing his ball and accidentally swallowed it.Recently, our senior veterinary nurse Nicole saw a young couple rush to the front door of our Tranent surgery, carrying their dog. The owners were obviously very distressed, so Nicole spoke with them and discovered that they were sure Loki, their three-year-old cockapoo, had tried to swallow the bouncy ball toy he had been playing with.Mrs Pamela Masson explained it was a hard rubber ball with rubber spikes on it.Nicole could hear Loki making strange noises when breathing she checked he was able to breathe and called the vet to examine Loki. Gently opening his mouth, they could just glimpse something blue at the back of his mouth.Nicole had previously been involved in dealing with a dog which had choked on a ball. She knew this dog was somehow managing to breathe, unlike the previous one she had dealt with, which was unable to breathe and had been rapidly turning blue.She reassured the owners and admitted Loki for treatment to extract the ball. As choking animals are very distressed, they are likely to panic and bite, although Loki was remaining remarkably calm. The team prepared short-acting intravenous anaesthetic and several pairs of dferent-sized forceps to help extract the ball. Once a catheter was placed in Lokirsquos leg vein, everything had to be performed rapidly as soon as the anaesthetic injection was administered, to prevent the ball falling further into Lokirsquos larynx or dropping into the oesophagus. With Nicole supporting his head and a light being shone into the mouth, the blue spiky ball was seen. Grasping it with forceps, and with some tension and rotation, the vet extracted the offending ball from Lokirsquos throat.The ball had a central hole, or tunnel, running through it. This was the reason Loki was able to breathe, albeit in a laboured, noisy fashion.The ball had lodged with its central tunnel in line with Lokirsquos mouth and larynx. The rubber spikes caused a bit of damage to the soft areas around his larynx, but these would soon heal. Loki recovered quickly from his short-acting anaesthetic and was soon heading home with his parents.It is great to play ball with your dog but make sure youdo play with a ball large enough that your dog cannot swallow or choke.If you are playing with a solid rubber ball, please ensure it does have a central hole right through it.This was undoubtedly the reason why Loki was able to breathe.It also makes it much easier for the vet to remove, as there is something to grab onto. A smooth rubber ball completely stuck in the throat is surprisingly dficult to grasp and remove.I think Loki will be playing with footballs from now on."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-scrap-popular-items-menu-make-way-5-new-offerings","story":"Fast food lovers will know, the UKrsquos most popular burger chain regularly updates its menu throughout the year with promotions to keep their offerings fresh.From this week, McDonaldrsquos has unveiled five new items that will be available to customers until mid-June.The new products will be part of the chains menu from May  to June  meaning you will only have a short time to sample their new offerings.One of the items making ais a firm favourite among McDonaldrsquos lovers, the Bacon Clubhouse Double.The burger consists of two % beef patties, two rashers of Beechwood smoked bacon, a slice of cheddar cheese, onions, tomato, lettuce, and sauce.Another item being added to the menu is the Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.A chicken option consisting of two crunchy Chicken Selects, Emmental cheese, lettuce, red onions, tomato relish, and mayonnaise.

And it works passably well, until Ryan breaks one of the rules by spending more than a single night with his colleague Ada and starting to see her regularly.

More than just an architectural marvel, the splendid Gothic building was ldquothe soul of a nation, and the inferno sent a shockwave through France. The first part of this book is a breathless minute-by-minute account of the night of the blaze, as firefighters battled to save what remained and curators risked their lives to save its most precious artefacts. From there, Poirier goes on to tell the story of Notre-Dame through the ages and how it is inextricably woven into French history. It falls short of staking a claim to being the definitive work, but this whistle-stop tour through such events as its reconsecration as a ldquoTemple of Reason, Napoleonrsquos coronation and the  liberation of Paris unlocks the door to the past and illuminates Notre-Damersquos role in French culture.HERE WE AREGraham SwtFollowing up the languid, beguiling Mothering Sunday, Swt continues to roam the past, settling on Brighton in : an end-of-the-pier show in the dying days of the iety era.

Jack becomes successful, Ronnie disappears from view.

It is Marguerite Duras, however, who comes closest to describing the artistry behind Real Estate: ldquoI think what I blame books for, in general, is that they are not free. One can see it in the writing: they are fabricated, organized, regulated one could say they conform. Aof the revision that the writer often wants to impose on himself. At that moment, the writer becomes his own cop.Durasrsquos disappointment with the timidity of most writing could be the inspiration for Levyrsquos inidual, seemingly effortless but highly crafted style. Real Estate, the third and final part of her ldquoliving autobiography, is like few memoirs you will read. As with its predecessors, Levyrsquos intention is not to offer a potted history. Decidedly uninterested in curriculum, instead she offers abundant vitae. There are more questions and philosophical musings here than dates or facts, and the book is propelled by her daydream of owning ldquoa grand house hellip with a pomegranate tree in the garden. Slowly she adds to this picture, filling in the rooms of her imaginary home, with which she replaces the dreary London apartment block with its soulless Corridors of Love where, for  years, she has raised her daughters. The previous volume, The Cost of Living, saw the end of her marriage, when she was , and depicts what happens when a woman is suddenly free in a world suspicious and sometimes actively hostile to women without a tether.The concept of property in ious shapes forms the architecture of this book. ldquoAre women real estate owned by patriarchy  Levy asks. And later, ldquoNever again did I want to sit at a table with a heterosexual couple and feel that women were borrowing the space. When that happens, it makes landlords of their male partners and the women are their tenants.As it relates to authors, the theme is not new. From Virginia Woolf to de Beauvoir, and as far back as Mary Somerville and Margaret Oliphant, the woman writerrsquos need for a room of her own has been a cri de coeur. In The Cost of Living, Levy angrily used the same framework: ldquoTo strip the wallpaper off the fairytale of The Family House in which the comfort and happiness of men and children has been the priority is to find behind it an unthanked, unloved, neglected, exhausted woman.Real Estate is conversational and coolly confessional, as Levy navigates a period of roughly a year. With her second daughter about to leave home for university, she seizes her situation as the springboard to leap into her past, and her unfolding thoughts. Its overarching tone is witty and un-self-pitying, with glimmers of rage. Still sore from her broken marriage, an astringency colours her reflections on relationships, as exemplied during the course of the book by her ldquoBest Male Friend. Visiting her while she is on a fellowship in Paris, he sets about dismantling his marriage, thereby embodying many of her theories.If this book were a house, then the first floor would be Levyrsquos perspective on the imbalance between what is expected of and given to women and men. The upper floors, with the best view, would be her own story, and the people who have enriched her le: her daughters, her late mother, the father she cannot bear to consider she will one day lose for ever.Alongside her preoccupation with the meaning of property and home is a literary quest: the search for the ldquomissing female character. Levy now recognises this absence in much of the male fiction she has read over the years. As her birthday approaches, this search takes on a direct signicance: ldquoI had no idea how to be a nearly--year-old female character.Real Estate does not offer answers to this problem. Instead, it pulses with ideas and emotion. Honest, original, invigorating and at times challenging, it captures Levyrsquos singular le, and the foundations on which it is built."},{"url":null,"title":"food-writer-rukmini-iyer-revolutionise-summer-barbecue","story":"Food writer Rukmini Iyer on how to revolutionise your summer barbecueRukmini IyerldquoMy mum doesnrsquot really hold back on constructive criticism, the food writer and cook admits. ldquoI think her words are, lsquoIf I donrsquot tell you, then who will rsquoBut that honesty came in useful, with Iyer saying it was ldquoreally helpful to get her feedback ndash particularly as she used the time to write her latest cookbook dedicated to veggie and vegan barbecue recipes.Both Iyerrsquos parents are GPs ndash her mother is now retired, but her father was still working. ldquoSo dad was at the surgery, but he likes to pop back for lunch because itrsquos not too far ndash so I tried to have things rolling off the barbecue in time for him to have a quick lunch before he went back to the surgery, she says.ldquoIt was very nice because as an adult, you donrsquot spend that much time with your parents. It was lovely to have them around and be able to cook a book where they could eat everything ndash both her parents are vegetarian.As well as being a way to bond with her family, Iyer fell in love with the therapeutic elements of barbecuing. ldquoIt was probably just being outside a lot, she confesses. ldquoI wrote the book during the first lockdown ndash I was in my parentsrsquo garden and I didnrsquot want to spend any time indoors, because it felt strange to be in that lockdown situation.ldquoI was even doing all the prep outside. I was taking a chopping board, all my veg, a couple of little bowls, doing all the prep outside and sitting and waiting for the barbecue to light. It was maximising being in open space.She also found it a ldquomore mindful way to cook, while still sharing sharing some similarities with her smash hit Roasting Tin series of books which all focus on easy, one pan meals you bung in the oven. ldquoWith this one, itrsquos similar in you just have to chop some things, put them on the barbecue, take them off and put a nice dressing on, she says.ldquoBut yoursquove got that added element I think is interesting, where you have to be quite watchful.

Yoursquore standing in front of it and itrsquos a visual and very tactile way to cook ndash I like that added element that yoursquore very close to the cooking process.There was another added benefit to decamping to her parentsrsquo house: space. ldquoHaving an outdoor space ndash I live in London in a flat, so usually Irsquom not really able to, Iyer says. ldquoBut even though I was doing all the barbecuing in my parentsrsquo garden, I was very much thinking, lsquoWhatrsquos portable  What can I do on a small barbecue rsquoldquoYou canrsquot assume everyonersquos got a massive Weber range ndash you might just be using a small one you got from TK Maxx.

It will also create a massive backlog for treatment as those in the queue are joined by those yet to be diagnosed.Commendably, the Scottish Government has developed a National Cancer Recovery Plan and provide funding for Early Diagnostic Centres. But fine words, plans and targets wonrsquot do the trick on their own. For example, the target of six weeks waiting time for some diagnostic tests hasnrsquot been met since . As with most things, it boils down to money. Cancer services were already stretched to the limit and Covid is likely to have made things much worse.

Again, urgently, Ms Sturgeon will seek to revive a four-nation UK deal.Why four nation  Because it is simpler to explain and administer, it deters Scots from heading south of the border to get round Scottish rules: and, bluntly, it provides additional protection for the FM against complaints from Scots who might be super-angryEngland gets a more open deal.In tandem with action on the virus, Ms Sturgeon willto Ministerial briefing boxes brimming with information about the economy. Here is a hint: the data will not be universally positive.No doubt her attention will be drawn to a report from the Bank of England forecasting that the UK economy will enjoy record economic growth in , perhaps around . per cent. That is founded on expectations of higher confidence among consumers, happy with the vaccine numbers.However, Nicola Sturgeon will need no reminding that this possible uplt follows a calamitous slump last year, when the economy shrank by nearly ten per cent the most precipitous drop in three centuries.She knows too that the voters will expect delivery of the spending promises made in her manesto: more money for health, education, housing and social care. All within a balanced budget, constrained still further by a pledge to freeze Scottish income tax rates and bands.That promise, mirrored by other parties, was designed to reassure fretful voters. Starting today, it too has to be delivered.Then there is the related issue of securing Parliamentary support for budget proposals. That depends on the final Holyrood numbers.If she gains an overall majority, then she has only to sustain discipline in her own ranks. However,she is dependent once more upon the Greens for budgetary support, there could be some trouble ahead.The Greens tend to push for radical fiscal change for example, arguing during the campaign that Scotland should seek ways to tax wealth as well as income.They will also press Nicola Sturgeon to support swter curbs on the extraction of North Sea oil. Ministers back a move away from fossil fuels but worry about the immediate impact on jobs, arguing for a justtransition.If it comes to it, they may have to remind the Greens that big parties have rights too.Then the fundamental contest.

So cheerio doorstep debating, rallies, walkabouts, all the usual fun and games, and hello masks and Zoom.The battle began in routine fashion with the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament. Some MSPs were not seeking re-election, among them Ruth Davidson, who was leaving to spend more time with her ermine.For everyone  it was off to the constituency or region to prepare for government. Or,you were a Scottish Labour candidate, to prepare your excuses. With Anas Sarwar in charge there was a certain spring in the partyrsquos step, with the new leader even joining in with an outdoors exercise class dancing to Uptown Funk. Yes sir, he can boogie.Willie Rennie continued his quest to stage the most ridiculous photo op ever, with shots of the LibDem leader at a penguin parade, in a giant deckchair, and boxing. Not wishing to be left out, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross continued his partyrsquos tradition of clambering on to the nearest military vehicle, in his case an armoured personnel carrier. And he wasnrsquot even campaigning in Castlemilk.Mr Ross received a lot of help from his predecessor, Ms Davidson, who even fronted the party political broadcast. Her omnipresence contrasted with the complete absence of Boris Johnson. Having said that wild horses wouldnrsquot keep him away, the Prime Minister preferred to stay in London and dodge questions about gold wallpaper rather than take his chances with rebellious Scots .Try as the parties did to generate excitement, the campaign was proving as empty and devoid of interest as Celticrsquos trophy cabinet. Then it happened. Cue movie trailer voice guy: ldquoThe sky darkened. Birds ceased singing. Jaws dropped. HE was back. And this time HE had brought a whole new party with him. After the initial shock of Alex Salmondrsquos , observers turned to more serious matters, like how to pronounce the Alba Partyrsquos name. Some said ldquoAlapa others ldquoWallopers. Mr Salmond came bearing the promise of a ldquosupermajority of independence-supporting MSPs who would make Johnson an offer he could not refuse.The media was delighted to see theof Mr Salmond, and reporters were soon asking SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonshe would work with her predecessor. Ms Sturgeon gave the impression she did not wish to be on the same continent as her old boss, never mind in coalition with him.The SNP leader conducted a lot of her campaign from her by-now-famous conservatory. FDR had his fireside chats, Nicola has natters in the greenhouse. Consensus had it that the election was in the bag for her. It only remained to be seenshe would win a majority, and which party would take second place to the SNP, the Conservatives or Labour.The TV debates gave voters a chance to see the party leaders in action. Not all the leaders, however. BBC Scotland and STV limited participation to the five largest parties in the Scottish Parliament, which meant no podium for Mr Salmond or George Galloway, the leader of the All for Unityparty.Mr Galloway tried to whip up interest in a mano a mano with the Alba leader, moderated by Andrew Neil. Viewers might have been interested had David Attenborough not featured extensive scenes of walruses fighting in his last televisual masterpiece.So five went off to debate, with Sarah Smith and Glenn Campbell holding the jaikets for the BBC, and Colin Mackay doing the same for STV.

From the  Treaty of Iona when Highland chiefs had to agree to send their heirs to English Protestant schools, through to ious education Acts which discriminated against the use of the Gaelic language, speakers have been punished and disrespected with predictable results. The same dismissive approach has generally been taken towards the ious Scots dialects.We are so fortunate that Scots Gaelic has not disappeared completely. Its daily use may sadly be hugely diminished, but the culture of the Gaeltachd through music, poetry and dance ndash not to mention language courses through the Gaelic College, UHI and the excellent Radio nan Gaidheal and BBC Albandash has been really encouraging, strengthening our Celtic links with other Celtic nations.We should treasure it and, where possible, bring it back into daily le. Im not a Gael but, for example, why should Gaelic speakers have to anglicise their names  Whether in school, broadcasting or in Parliament, it would be a small but signicant step to use peoples Gaelic names. People would soon get used to them rather than view them as something to be avoided, just as they are becoming used to the names of \"newer\" generations of Scots originally from dferent cultures.The good work done to give Gaelic names on street signs, town signs and public vehicles are not, as some people would have it, confusing, but of real interest to all Scots as well as our tourists. The everyday usage of peoples Gaelic names would add to this. Likewise, many Scottish dialects are also threatened through \"homogenising\" our language. As a consequence, we lose so many words that provided colour and local identity. Some local authority schools may be more accepting of language ersity, but private schools perhaps not.Those who do not take an interest in Scotlands cultural history and the preservation of it, should broaden their minds and start to have a bit more respect for the positive role that the languages and dialects have, rather than head towards a \"monoculture\".Andrew Turnbull, Perth.TIME TO LISTEN TO RURAL SCOTSWHILST your Letters Pages are full of concerns from those living in the Central Belt, why is it that the vast array of wind turbines and HV pylons that desecrate rural Scotland receive no attention  The First Minister may well criticise Boris Johnson, but at least Westminster has extended democratic rights over wind farm applications to rural England. Why then do Central Belt politicians refuse to grant the same rights to those in rural Scotland A good move by Holyrood in listening to rural Scots would be a decision to run the HV cables in the GlenKens of Galloway underground, closely followed by a decision to set up two National Parks in southern Scotland to balance those north of the M.Ian Moir, Castle Douglas.GREEN CLAIMS DONT STAND UPGREEN electricity should be electricity that is generated  per cent from renewable sources, not fossil fuels. Several major companies claim to supply \" per cent green electricity\". This is impossible since fossil fuels generate a large percentage of the electricity sent to the grid.A report by consultancy firm Baringa in partnership with ScottishPower and Good Energy shows that as little as three per cent of the power supplied by green providers is \"genuinely green\" they have asked the Advertising Standards Authority to investigate. Could the claim of \" per cent green electricity\" be termed \"greenwashing\" which is similar to \"whitewashing\", but used exclusively by the green brigade Clark Cross, Linlithgow.* JOHN Flemingclaims that I am unaware that wind power can be used to electrolyse hydrogen. He is obviously unaware of the sheer cost and unviability of this idea in the context of trying to power a huge industrial economy like the UK.Other people in his shoes claim that batteries are the answer. But the worlds biggest batterywould only provide the UK with energy for a theoretical maximum of . seconds. I cant find the cost of Gateway but its undoubtedly at least  million.

Add into the mix the two most prominent politicians in recent Scottish political history fighting like ferrets in a sack where one faced criminal charges and the other, the current First Minister, found by a parliamentary committee of having misled parliament.Therefore and unsurprisingly perhaps, the SNP put independence front and centre of its campaign rather than its failed domestic policies which simply do not stand up to the slightest level of scrutiny. Further, the eternal promise of independence and the land of milk and honey galvanised SNP support and made it a one-issue election.It has become clear that the supposed unionist parties, Conservative, Labour and the LibDems, were taken in hook, line and sinker by the SNP tactics and got continually dragged into the constitutional question rather than providing any focus on the SNP domestic record and the solutions that an alternative government might provide. Nicola Sturgeon must have a huge smile on her face at the lack of any real and meaningful interrogation of her record.Therefore the oppositionrsquos other opportunity to rein back the SNP was to adopt some sort of agreement around tactical voting, but even with that opportunity, personal party politics triumphed and yet again they looked inwards rather than working together for the benefit of the Scottish people.There was a little evidence of tactical voting where the Dumbarton constituency was held by Jackie Baillie for Labour benefitting from Tory votes and Galloway and West Dumfries was held by Finlay Carson benefitting from Labour votes. However the real question and indeed the failure of the three unionist parties is why they did not do more to blunt the SNP  It is worth looking at just a small number of constituency results to evidence this point.In Ayr, the sitting Tory MSP John Scott lost to the SNP by  votes. Labour and the LibDems could not even finish second here but polled , votes. Angus Robertson won Edinburgh Central by , votes. Labour and the LibDems polled , votes with no chance of winning. The SNP won Banffshire and Buchan by  votes whilst yet again Labour and the LibDems, with no chance of winning polled , votes. East Lothian went to the SNP by , votes with the Tories and Lib Dems polling , votes. Aberdeen South goes to the SNP by , votes with Labour and the Lib Dems polling , votes with no chance of winning.Douglas Ross, Anas Sarwar and Willie Rennie have simply and contemptibly denied the supporters of the Union any chance to hold the SNPrsquos feet to the fire in sorting out the domestic issues, of which there are many, facing the Scottish people. They should be ashamed of themselves for their feeble and inept campaigns and their defence of the Union.Richard Allison, Edinburgh.JUST WHO WAS TELLING THE TRUTH SINCE the turn of the year I have received six election statements from the Conservative Party, all of them assuring me that the only way to stop indyref was to vote Conservative. These were all in the name of Douglas Ross and, sometimes Ruth Davidson. At the same time I occasionally heard the UK leader of that party assuring me that, under no circumstances, would he agree to a second referendum.I could not decideMr Ross and Ms Davidson did not believe that their leader was telling the truth orthey were just wilfully misinforming the electorate. I concluded that I could not entrust them with my vote.Ken MacVicar, Lesmahagow.I CAN FORGIVE THE SNP NOTHINGIRONIC, is it not, that the SNP has a landslide victory when it cannot stop landslides on to the A  I find the post-election triumphalist display by the SNP, of an increasingly-defeatist attitude to the duty of maintaining our Treaty of Union, is demoralising on many levels.The unceasing lack of thankfulness to the UK Government for organising both Covid vaccine sourcing and the emergency job-saving furlough scheme are just two instances of what I see as the insipid nature of the SNP belligerence and misappropriation of praiseworthy responsibility.As a unionist I can forgive the SNP nothing, for I have now witnessed everything from its fiscal incompetence to an education policy which Victorians would endorse. Those who would shatter the UK seem to forgive it everything, for I believe they have selective blindness like a fawning lover.I consider that the SNP has promoted stress, anxiety and ill health among those of us who again fear we may loose our citizenship of the UK with its embracing family of nations.The possible loss of Scotlandrsquos security which is implicitly underwritten and assured by the Act of Union has only one international trade effect ndash it puts investors off. However,the separatists are successful in destroying our Union, one thing history has taught us is clear those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind.Bill Brown, Milngavie.ARE the nationalists simply trying to wear us down  They are charged with responsibility for running that which has been devolved.

You have no need to fear anything, Mr McKay, have confidence.Sandy Slater, Stirling.LABOURS DEMISE SELF-INFLICTEDKEVIN McKennarsquos opinion piece on Saturdaywas an accurate analysis of the reasons for the Labour Partyrsquos decline. The cracks in Labourrsquos foundations were there even at its electoral high-water mark in . Soon after Tony Blairrsquos landslide that year, there was a by-election in Paisley South and three of us from Stirling Labour went through to help Douglas Alexanderrsquos campaign.We teamed up with a minibus-full of students from St Andrews University to canvas Foxbar. From a distance, the housing reminded me of the area where I grew up, Mastrick in Aberdeen, but close up it was clear that it had been allowed to deteriorate very badly some of the students were visibly shocked to see such conditions in the UK. There were no Labour posters in windows in Foxbar, but there were for the SNP.Over the next decade, I campaigned for Labour in some of its other strongholds. I was struck by the number of housing estates, managed by Labour councils for decades, that were run-down and depressed. I hoped that Labour governments at Westminster and Holyrood would launch a housing programme to provide decent, warm homes for families and to create jobs but Labour was more interested in playing Cool Britannia and building white elephant aircraft carriers.Sir Keir Starmer, a London lawyer and knight of the realm, talks about Labour being the party of ldquoworking people, which doesnrsquot wash any more. ldquoWorking people, or the working class, is no longer one relatively homogenous group. There arenrsquot great hordes of men rushing out of shipyard, mine or factory gates at the end of their sht, and few private sector workplaces remain unionised.Labourrsquos dficulties are largely self-inflicted. After decades of dominance in its strongholds, Labour assumed that people would continue voting for them even when it demonstrated that, in power, it really didnrsquot care about their priorities. Eventually people tired of being ignored, their welfare overlooked, and decided that they might as well take their vote where.New Labour was a fantastic concept: with a solid working-class core, all it needed was support from a relatively small number of centrist and middle-class voters to win a landslide. But in moving to the centre it lost its core voters, who expected rather more than crumbs from the table, drted away and arenrsquot inclined to .

The people of Scotland.But who are the people of Scotland and what did they say exactly  In her speech, Ms Sturgeon said the SNPrsquos re-election for a fourth term was extraordinary and she was right. All the precedents tell us that, after  years or so, people get fed up with the party in power and give the other guys a try, and yet the SNP, after  years, and a persistently poor record in office, has attracted nearly half the vote. Itrsquos not supposed to happen this way, and yet it has.However, in acknowledging the SNPrsquos achievement, we should also look a little closer at what the First Minister said in the speech because thatrsquos how we can compare it to what actually happened in the election. The dferences between the two ndash what Ms Sturgeon said, and what happened ndash reveal some of the linguistic techniques the First Minister and the SNP use. But they also reveal what needs to changewersquore ever going to break the current deadlock.First, the ldquopeople of Scotland stuff. Irsquom assuming Ms Sturgeon bases her right to speak for the people on the pro-independence majority at Holyrood. As the First Minister pointed out, the SNP won a record number of the constituency seatsand, even after the adjustment for the list votes, the SNP and the Greens have  of the parliamentrsquos  seats, or % ndash a majority.However, the SNP and the Greens have a majority of the seats based on a minority of the votes. The SNP won .% of the constituency vote and the Greens took .% ndash or % combined. The Tories, the Lib Dems, and Labour, on the other hand, took .%. You might see this as just nit-picking over a clear win for the nationalists ndash and they did clearly win under the current system ndash but the result means two things. First, when Nicola Sturgeon claims to speak for the people of Scotland, shersquos really only speaking for .% of them at most. And second, we need a better system, based on how people actually vote.The need for a better system, I hope, would be obvious to any fair-minded voter. For a start ndash although it ultimately failed ndash at one point Alba looked like it might be able to do a bit of jiggery-pokery with the list vote to articially boost pro-independence representation. But the other lesson of the election is that many pro-UK voters felt they had to vote tactically, and many did so with positive results. Some unionists see that as good news, but unionists shouldnrsquot have to vote tactically to get fair representation. It is another argument for a better, more proportional system, ideally single transferable vote.Similar problems apply to Ms Sturgeonrsquos remarks about another referendum. A referendum, she said, was the will of the people and anyone who tried to stop it would be standing in direct opposition to the people . But the assertion is based on the same logical flaw that .% represents a settled will . You might also assume the .% that voted Tory, Labour or Lib Dem do not want a referendum. In any case, the idea that another vote on independence is the will of the people is a distinctly dodgy claim.Perhaps the change thatrsquos needed here ndash on top of a better system ndash is a referendum that ensures the result does actually reflect a settled will rather than the SNPrsquos version of it. The SNP is demanding a referendum on .% and would claim a victory in the referendum on .%, but both, to some extent, are a distortion of whatrsquos going on. One way to stop it would be to require two-thirds for a referendum win ndash at least, that way it would ensure talk of ldquowill of the people had a better basis in reality.But even thatrsquos not the end of the changes we need because Ms Sturgeon also talked a lot about the Tories . Scotland, she said, was facing many more years of right-wing Tory governments and could choose a more progressive alternative. These are familiar comments and part of an attempt to portray the border with England as an unbridgeable gulf. The Scots, she says, are utterly dferent from the rest of the UK, therefore the SNP, therefore referendum, therefore independence.But the SNPrsquos argument runs into the same old ldquopeople of Scotland problem. Ms Sturgeon speaks about anti-Tory Scotland in the same way she speaks about the will of the people, asScotland were one entity that speaks with one voice. But Scotland is Liberal Caithness where my mother grew up and Tory Aberdeenshire where I grew up and itrsquos old-school Labour Ayrshire where I live now. Yes, the SNP dominates, but perhaps Ms Sturgeonrsquos speech could have acknowledged that Scotland is not one thing and that half of the country didnrsquot vote for her. Such an approach would have shown more subtlety, reality, and ndash dare I say it ndash humility.But what did we get instead  A speech based on a logical flaw and fuelled by anger, arrogance, and, I suspect, a bit of disappointment that she didnrsquot get an outright majority. But then maybe thatrsquos the last thing that needs to change: Nicola Sturgeon herself. The talk before the election was of building momentum and an SNP majority that Boris Johnson couldnrsquot say no to, and the SNP certainly needs such momentum before it can achieve another referendum and win it. A stand-still election like the one wersquove just had will not do.But to achieve such momentum, Nicola Sturgeon will need to convince voters who didnrsquot back her ndash the .% ndash and they are unlikely to be chuffed by talk of the ldquowill of the people. They might be impressed, though, by something more realistic and honest. There is no ldquowill of the people, there is only a people ided, andNicola Sturgeon acknowledged that, and started talking about it, maybe she would have a better chance of changing it.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

But there doesnrsquot appear to have been any rebuke for the drugs deaths crisis, their failed education record, missed hospital waiting time targets, rising child poverty rates, the exam results scandal, or failures in local policing.The next Scottish Government has an opportunity over the next five years to make amends for past failures and getting caught up in an independence campaign will only take the SNPrsquos eye off the ball once again.However, the SNP did not win a majority in the election and as a minority government will require support from other parties to pass budgets and any major reforms.The Scottish Greens will likely prop up the SNP in future policy discussions, but this will requirepolicy trade-offs infor budget support.With COP firmly in the sights of both parties as an opportunity to showcase Scotland as a leader in tackling climate change on the global stage, will the Scottish Greens be willing to lend support to independence which could risk the SNP taking its focus off meeting its emissions reduction targets of % by  ndash which it has done for the past two years in a row.They have already said they want bold action from the Scottish Government and now they are in a position to bargain for this.Read more:Indyref and a blinkered green agenda could harm Scottish farmings futureDuring Sundayrsquos Andrew Marr programme, a suggestion of next spring to hold another referendum was put to the First Minister, to which, of course, she said she was contemplating. Nicola Sturgeon hasnrsquot officially committed to a timescale, other than the first half of the next parliamentary term, but it would appear that the media is setting the ball rolling by proposing such a timeline. As much as I have criticised the SNP for pedalling talks of Indyref during a pandemic, journalists are also guilty of fuelling the debate and diminishing print space or airtime for more immediate and pressing issues.Over the past week I have been moving into my new house, which has involved many hours of deep cleaning whilst tuned in to my radio and coverage of the election.Hats off to BBC Radio Scotland team for managing to fill three daysrsquo worth of election coverage with very little to report on other than the one major news story: would the SNP gain a majority Although they covered results and reaction across the entire country, the main topic on every reportersrsquo lips was whether the SNP would have a mandate to hold another referendum. So, for every listener tuned in, we are being told that this is the discussion we need to be having, this is the headline we should all be taking away.In between googling tutorials on how to sand kitchen worktops, I checked in to the community Facebook page for my local village and was struck by the fact that none of the members were remotely engaged in discussions over the election, let alone independence. Like many other communities across the country, this village is still in the grips of a pandemic, so quite understandably, most posts and discussions revolved around Covid advice and best practice, information about the local youth club reopening, as well as a series of church services.Read more:Scottish election: Indyref cant continue to dominate the next five years mdash there are bigger issuesMembers were posting aboutfitness camps and slots which had come available for hairdressers and beauty salons.

on Facebook promotions ndash a total of pound, for  targeted ads.With their  seats ed, this works out at around pound, per seat.Meanwhile the SNP spent pound, on  ads on partyrsquos official page and just pound, on  posts on that of Nicola Sturgeon.:Alba Party spent pound, down Mark Zuckerbergs toilet as election ad spend revealedThe comparatively small spend for the nationalists, a total of pound,, works out at around pound for each of the  seats won.Keith Brown, the SNPrsquos campaign director, said: ldquoThese figures are a hammer blow for the Tories and their ultra-negative campaign - they are also a great endorsement of the SNPs digital communications strategy.\"Boris Johnson and Douglas Rosss party blasted double the cash that the SNP invested in digital ads and yet they won less than half of the number of seats that we did.\"The UK government will have spent a fortune on Twitter ads too - but people in Scotland are not daft and see right through all this Tory spin.\"This represents a disaster for Labour too, their combined Facebook spend is three times ours.ldquoFact is the SNPrsquos digital campaign was far more engaging than the rest and no other party can compete with our huge organic share rate.The Alba Party, whose leader Alex Salmond admitted early on during the counting that his party was unlikely to make a breakthrough, spent pound, on  promotions.Internet political campaign expert Dr Rhys Crilley, part of the Department of Politics and International Relations at University of Glasgow, said it is ldquono surprise that some parties spent incredible amounts of money on Facebook ads in order to get their message across to voters.He added: ldquoThe fact that Labour spent way more than any other party on Facebook ads yet had their worst performance ever in the history of the Scottish parliament demonstrates that throwing money at online advertising isnt an effective strategyyour policies and politicians dont appeal to the Scottish public.ldquoThe same can be said of Alba, who were confident that because they were pro-independence, they could take enough of the SNPs list vote to get seats in Holyrood, but their social conservatism and uninspiring vision for independence has no appeal with voters.ldquoBy spending pound, on Facebook ads and absolutely bombing in the polls, Alex Salmond basically poured his supporters money down Mark Zuckerbergs toilet.Dr Crilley said that with such a large membership base, the SNP ldquoprobably donrsquot have to rely on spending as much as other parties.He also pointed out that many of the SNP ads featured an endorsement from Line of Duty star Martin Compston ndash something that may perform better ldquowhen compared to other political ads which can often be pretty boring.Elsewhere, the Scottish Greens spent pound, on  ads, meanwhile the Scottish Lib Dems paid pound, on  posts.Commenting on the findings, a Scottish Labour spokesman said: ldquoFor the first time in recent political history Scottish Labour is competitive digitally.ldquoWersquore building a sophisticated operation as part of our journey towards building the alternative to the SNP.A spokesman for the Scottish Tories said: ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives fought this campaign on doorsteps, in the press and online.ldquoWe stopped an SNP majority, as we promised, and won our best ever result with an extra , votes than . For the second Holyrood election in a row, we have  MSPs and we have won more votes than ever before.ldquoWe were the only pro-UK party to improve our standing and we have cemented our place as Scotlandrsquos strongest and largest opposition party.And Alba Campaign Manager and Senior Councillor Chris McEleny said: ldquoAlbarsquos strength was in the thousands of members that joined the party to campaign for Scottish independence.ldquoItrsquos no surprise that the Tories spent nearly as much as all the pro-independence parties combined.ldquoQuestions about where that money has come from have long been asked, whereas the independence movement thrives on the support of ordinary people across Scotland.ldquoAlthough social media is a medium that many people use, Scottish independence will be won by winning the hearts and minds of the people of Scotland by getting a campaign for independence up and running, not by topping a Facebook spend league table.Commenting on the Scottish Greensrsquo figures, a spokesman said: ldquoThis election has seen the highest spend by all political parties since devolution began.ldquoThe Scottish Greens do not have wealthy corporate donors and instead rely on supporters and members, so it is no surprise that our overall spending on advertising has been dwarfed by the other parties.ldquoDespite this, the Scottish Greens grew our vote all across Scotland and were the only opposition party to make gains at this election.And a spokeswoman for the Scottish Lib Dems said: ldquoWe used a iety of campaign techniques, leaflets, doorstep conversations and online advertising.ldquoOur message got through to people in our strongest areas and we achieved record-breaking majorities."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-cant-wait-hug-family-spare-hugs-work-colleagues","story":"After a long year of no hugging because he had had a cancer operation at the start of the first lockdown, my mind made rapid calculations: Hersquos had  jags Irsquove had one Irsquove just had a negative lateral flow test for work in mid-March Nicola Sturgeon said hugging might be allowed in tier  and Boris Johnson has been promising hugs from next Monday.Maybe just a wee sneaky one. MaybeI just hold my breath and look to the side. So I did. I hugged him and it was the most precious, liberating thing. In the next few weeks, all going well, lots of us will be hugging again, remaking those glorious physical connections with family and friends and catching up on those hug IOUs.But what about all the other hugs  The workplace hugs, the first-time-yoursquore-meeting someone hugs, the awkward is-this-a-hug-or-an-air-kiss hug, the unwanted hug, the overly-long hug, the badly-timed hug.:Uzma Mir: Why cant Scots, in Scotland, use Scots words, without being called jakeys I think the time has come to review the strategy on them, because Irsquove come to realise Irsquom not a naturally huggy person, especially outside of my family, but lsquofitting inrsquo has somehow forced me to become more tactile and less assertive about what I actually want. Now the pandemic has shone a light on this aspect of human interaction, and Irsquom thinking perhaps we are all due a hug correction or at least a reassessment of who we are hugging and why.Since I started working over  years ago, things have become a lot huggier. In those days there were handshakes, smiles and occasional cheek-pressing which I must confess to never being comfortable with either.Meeting new colleagues in pre-covid times inexplicably brought hugs, despite the fact I would often fire out a hand as a pre-emptive strike, only for it to be metaphorically brushed away before the ritualistic meaty slapping together of two torsos. I mean, it would take a strong person to say lsquosorry, Irsquom not really a huggy personrsquo to the boss, so, in I would go for that awkward work hug followed by a flurry of back-patting.In fact, just last week I met my new boss for the first time in a Glasgow hotel. Although we had had quite a few Zoom meetings, I was surprised to see she was very tall, so did a silent lsquohallelujahrsquo that we couldnrsquot hug, because my head would have been at her chest level, which might have been weird.I then proceeded to nearly poke her in the midrf with a badly targeted elbow bump. Bring back the taciturn nodding of the old days, please, and release me from my confused social cues hell.This has more than a little to do with being brought up with dferent cultural values. My mum, who grew up in a small town in Pakistan, could never get her head round the Hogmanay hugging and kissing from slightly merry complete strangers. Every New Year party we went to, we would search for her only to find that she had locked herself in the loo for about  minutes after the Bells to avoid said hugs.I do wonder after years of hugging being de rigeur, what effect,any, Covid awareness will have on those previously encouraged to hug. Like men, for example.They have become much more huggy than I ever remember. Sportsmen, politicians, technicians at NASA after a successful space mission, faith leaders, movie stars, health workers ndash have all been relishing good, ostentatious, st century hugs with one another.Theyrsquove been told hugging helps to reduce stress, could protect them from illnesses, can alleviate loneliness and can make them happier by causing the release of oxytocin ndash a hormone that induces relaxation and lowers anxiety. Women, apparently, have been benefitting from hugs, and men should be getting in on the act.Therersquos been a veritable small industry set up around hugs from Tokyorsquos soineyas ndash cuddle cafes ndash to the people on street corners with the lsquohugs available herersquo signs. Sadly, these folk will need to retrain, as careers prospects may be limited in the short to medium term.:Fidelma Cook: I need to face whatrsquos coming with courage but I still hope against hope for a miracleThe American National Hugging Day was cancelled in January this year too, so hugs are going to have to be reconceived and rebranded to get out of the pandemic downturn. On a serious note, most of those whorsquove gone through lockdowns alone will be in desperate need of human connection, so the rest of us should be there for them.For me, I think Irsquom going to be braver about telling people I donrsquot know or who I donrsquot want to hug, that Irsquom not a huggy person. I canrsquot imagine my oxytocin levels will be impacted too much by not hugging a colleague Irsquove worked with for a couple of weeks as much as I admire and like them.I will do a quick cost benefit analysis in my head of how much I need a squeeze from my mum as opposed to how much I need one from a friend of a friend, or how much someone living alone might need a hug compared to those living with others.And I think, in a post Covid world ndash whenever that is ndash that will be okay.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He hung tarpaulins from the ceiling. Those were years when he was exploring all sorts of new ideas.ldquoIt is truly wonderful that the cottages are being used again as studios. I feel, like my siblings, that Rory would have been really delighted by this inspired turn of events.The cottage is being restored as a creative space as part of a bigger project at Marchmont House led by former tech entrepreneur Hugo Burge.It will serve as a hub for artists and creative businesses.Mr McEwenrsquos other daughter, Christabel Holland, told of her memories of her fatherrsquos time at the site.ldquoRory first began making etchings when he was at Fogo and I remember the excitement of the huge and heavy press arriving, and the trays of acid which I found terrying, she said.ldquoHe showed me how you could use a feather to move the acid across a plate without it being eaten away.ldquoMy memories of the Fogo studio are all very happy ones the Manse was across the road and my siblings and I were encouraged to go and visit Rory at work.

I was delighted to find Victoria Park and Whiteinch Library within walking distance and used both regularly. As our children came along, visits to both increased. At primary school the children changed books fortnightly and used library resources for school projects, directed by helpful, efficient staff. As our family grew we moved to a larger home in Scotstoun, but continued to use the library, walking through the park to get there. At secondary school our teenage children used the excellent reading room as an oasis of calmto study for exams. When grandchildren came along, they were also introduced to \"Destination Library\". They enjoyed being read to and being allowed to choose their own books in the childrens room. Often there would be a \"Bounce and Rhyme\" pre-school event taking place or a librarian-led storytelling session with local nursery school children.I firmly believe books fire childrens imagination and open their eyes to worlds and possibilities beyond their present experiences.The above is the story of just one familys involvement in the local library it can be replicated many times throughout this cityLong before the pandemic the reading room had an IT suite which was well used by students, \"silver surfers\" and newcomers to our country. It also had a local history section, community and NHS leaflets ndash and a photocopier!I cannot see any suitable accommodation within Scotstoun Leisure Centrewhich could replace the three excellent rooms presently housed in the stunning Victorian building that is Whiteinch Library.Surely, councillors, libraries should be seen as an integral part of the pandemic recovery plan for education, community and mental health Ann Millar, Glasgow.BOTH GYMS AND PUBS NEED SUPPORTDOUG Marrmakes valid and pertinent points about the impact the Covid pandemic is having and will continue to have on public health in Scotland, citing last years pause in screening for bowel, breast and cervical cancers as one obvious concern.The  per cent rise in patients awaiting diagnostic testing during  coupled with \"around , fewer pathologically confirmed cases than would have been expected\" are worrying statistics and it is to be hoped the Scottish Governments National Cancer Recovery Plan is sufficiently funded to tackle these areas. Where, however, I must take issue with Mr Marr is where he does what I can only describe as a \"hatchet job\" on the beleaguered hospitality industry, making mention of \"the causal link between alcohol, smoking, obesity and cancer\", and then talking of a \"national obsession with reopening pubs\" saying \"it seems more important to get the pubs open before gyms\".PerhapsMr Marr were a gym member he would have known that gyms and sport centres reopened on April , the same day pubs were allowed to begin serving alcohol outdoors within strict guidelines. I can only assume that Mr Marr believes that in the almost full year that pubs and restaurants were closed the people of Scotland sat at home drinking water and eating lettuce  Figures showing big increases sales of takeaway meals and alcohol would seem to suggest otherwise.The hospitality industry is heavily regulated and promotes safe and responsible drinking in a safe and controlled environment and as for the comment about \"down the pub to freeze under a brolly and consume a burger and chips and six pints of overpriced lager\", I consider that deeply insulting to the pubs of Scotland , many of which provide healthy, locally sourced food of the highest standard and a selection of drinks, including non-alcoholic ones, at reasonable prices.Going to the pub and going to the gym are not mutually exclusive, though they both operate in sectors hit hard by the pandemic and thus both need all the support, and positive messaging, they can get.Billy Gold, Hielan Jessie bar, Glasgow.GAELIC DRIVE IS MISPLACEDI COULD not disagree more profoundly with Andrew Turnbullwhen he talks about the ever-more widespread use of Gaelic.

However, the reaction from across the Irish Sea at having only eight players make the cut ndash with Johnny Sexton, James Ryan and Garry Ringrose amongst the omitted ndash was startlingly fierce.The fact that Scotland also have eight players on the trip was a particular source of angst, with former Irish forward turned outspoken pundit Neil Francis amusingly unhinged in his outrage.He claimed that he had detected a lsquosheepishnessrsquo about Gregor Townsend during an interview ahead of the grand reveal and asserted that this was clearly because the Scotsman had managed to bully or manipulate Lions head coach Warren Gatland into picking an unjustiable number of his countryman for the trip.Poor Warren! Who knew he was so malleable! ldquoNone of the Scottish players who have been included are starting Test standard, asserted Francis.ldquoGatland will not risk the whole Test series on the vagaries of some lunar alignment in Finn Russellrsquos head or how he feels when he gets out of bed on the day of the Test match, he snorted.ldquoBringing Duhan van der Merwe makes me sick to my stomach, he gasped.ldquoAli Price is the worst original selection pick at scrum-half for decades, he howled.Those are just the most colourful highlights. Stuart Hogg, Chris Harris, Rory Sutherland and Zander Fagerson were also targeted in an astonishing tirade. There wasnrsquot much in the way of analysis, but you canrsquot doubt the manrsquos passion!Former Ireland and Lions captain Brian OrsquoDriscoll was slightly more circumspect but his snfy take on Russell being selected ahead of Sexton was even more disappointing because it came from someone who we expect a bit more self-awareness and even-handedness from.ldquoWhen yoursquove got the Scottish head coach in Gregor Townsend in one corner, when yoursquore talking - decisions, of course hersquos going to be arguing for all of Finn Russellrsquos positive attributes, he said. ldquoThen you wait and look across and no-one is saying that about Johnny Sexton.This conveniently overlooks the fact that Gatland knows all about Sextonrsquos attributes, having started him at No. in five out of the last six Lions Tests over two tours, and naming him on the bench in the other. It also ignores the fact that Russell and Townsend have a chequered history, and while their relationship has been resurrected following that spectacular spat during the  Six Nations, the idea of the coach being tunnel visioned by the playerrsquos positive attributes to the exclusion of all  is patently ludicrous.In fairness, not all the wrath has been directed towards Scotland for having the temerity to match Irelandrsquos representation. Englandrsquos haul of  players, despite losing to all three of the other contributing countries during the recent Six Nations, has also gone down badly.While this disproportionate reaction from our Celtic cousins is a big relief because it proves that Scottish rugby does not have a monopoly on unjustied indignation, it does also highlight how important having a healthy representation on a Lions tour can be for a country, and wersquore not just talking about bragging rights here.The omission of players like -year-old Ryan and -year-old Ringrose is raw in Ireland because they know from previous experience that a tour such as this offers benefit which reaches beyond the inidual players involved.The self-belief, toughness and basic understanding of what is required to operate at the very highest level rubs off and it becomes a virtuous circle. In reality, eight players on the tour is not a disaster for Ireland, but they would much rather have  or  because the more players they have who have lived through the experience the wider the benefit reaches, and they would much rather their opponents didnrsquot have the same number getting that exposure.Over five successive tours during the last  years, Scotland have not had more than three players in an initial squad, which has undoubtedly left the national team and the two pro sides at a critical disadvantage when competing in high-class, big-pressure matches.Now, having eight players ndash plus two coaches ndash coming out of an environment where they have spent two months living, training, playing and hopefully winning alongside the best that Britain and Ireland have to offer, whilst taking on arguably the sportrsquos ultimate challenge, can have huge legacy benefits to the pro game in this country.Stuart Hogg, Finn Russell, Chris Harris, Duhan van der Merwe, Ali Price, Zander Fagerson, Rory Sutherland and Hamish Watson owe it to themselves ndash and they owe it to Scotland ndash to make the absolute most of this opportunity.Scotlandrsquos biggest ever Lionsrsquo representation was nine, when Finlay Calder led the touring side to a - series victory over Australia, and they won the Grand Slam the following year.

Yet the SNP had the highest efficiency per seat won.They had a very strong start at the beginning of the election campaign and additionally capitalised on excellent leadership and communication of the First Minister during the pandemic.Their messages emphasising competent leadership of Nicola Sturgeon and democratic argument for the second independence referendum after the COVID- recovery were cleverly chosen and boded well with the Scottish electorate.The fact that the Scottish Labour and Anas Sarwar were the highest spenders indicates their ambition to become the biggest opposition party. Anas Sarwar is considered as one of the most talented leaders in the Labour Party, not just in Scotland, but UK-wide, yet his persistent distancing from the constitutional debate did not seem to convince the voters.The Labour focused on COVID recovery instead, but orcing the recovery from the constitutional question is like discussing the issue without a backdrop. The constitutional question matters to people of Scotland on both sides of the debate, so it is unsurprising that their advertising spending did not translate into an electoral success.The Scottish Conservatives were campaigning on a single issue ndash opposing the second referendum ndash and came across as the most convincing amongst the pro-union parties. Their relatively high spending figure indicates how important this election was for the future of the United Kingdom and their investment was the second most efficient after the SNP.The Liberal Democrats found themselves in a conundrum. They pose as a pro-EU party, even though Willie Rennie during televised debates showed an astonishing lack of knowledge and understanding of the EU, evident in incorrect statements on how old the EU is and misguided comparisons between the EU and the UK. Lib Dems also lack clear policies on what this pro-European stance means, while reducing the constitutional argument to a simple ldquowe do not need another isive referendum. It is unsurprising that their spending of pound, was the least efficient per seat won .:Alba Party spent pound, down Mark Zuckerbergs toilet as election ad spend revealedFollowing the Liberal Democrats were the Scottish Greens with pound, spent on Facebook ads, indicating their hopes to increase the representation in the Scottish Parliament, which they did with a reasonable efficiency. They came across as a very consistent and competent party in this election and their pro-independence arguments were at times more eloquent and convincing than the SNPrsquos.The increasing societal concern about climate emergency, particularly in the light of post-COVID recovery, also played in their favour.Albarsquos spending was the lowest and the most fruitless. The party had a slim chance in this election, considering it was only founded three months before the election with manesto launched a few weeks before the polling day and tainted by allegations against its leader Alex Salmond.Social media without a doubt played a very important part in this election, but there is a question to what extent Facebook advertising had an effect beyond ldquopreaching to the converted.Where social media will play a far more important role is cultivating the future political debates in Scotland. We need to move away from clicheacutes of ldquoisive referendums and ldquouniting the country. Referendums do not need to be isivewe learn to listen to each other, debate with respect and discuss issues that matter in a constructive manner. There is no progress without dferences in opinions, so we need to come to terms with ersity of views and cultivate a constructive democratic dialogue amongst politicians and the electorate alike.

In fact, research by NatureScot during the first half of  found % of people feel spending time outdoors in nature helped them de-stress, relax and unwind, with % agreeing it also improved their physical health.A second survey later in the year demonstrated people had largely maintained these habits in engaging with physical activity in nature. Itrsquos just one reason why NatureScot is putting such a strong emphasis on its Make Space For Nature campaign.This provides practical ways to help everyone in Scotland care for nature in local outdoor spaces wherever they live, while simultaneously helping combat climate change. Itrsquos proving a popular initiative and NatureScot Chief Executive Francesca Osowska points out major changes often begin with small, inidual actions.ldquoOne of the points wersquore putting across is everybody can do their bit and take practical actions to improve nature, she says. ldquoIt could be not mowing an area of your grass. Irsquove a little bit of slate in my flower bed, which looks completely ridiculous but itrsquos actually a snail hotel!ldquoSo everybody can do their bit, whether they have a window box, a very small garden or a larger space in their community.NatureScot offers a range of online resources, including motivational ideas for nature-based activities for children and young people in urban green spaces. Francesca says:ldquoYoung people want to know how they can engage in nature. When being at school wasnrsquot an option during Covid lockdown, we offered practical tools to help them. Parents needed a bit of inspiration to deal with home schooling ndash everything from what you can do on your own doorstep to making a bigger contribution.One way to make a bigger contribution through NatureScot is to become a citizen scientist. These volunteers take part in dferent surveys that span a range of areas, habitats and species. The data gathered is used by scientists to better understand how the environment is operating and where more positive action might be needed.NatureScot believes such volunteering and engagement are major drivers behind conservation work in Scotland and integral to its own mission. ldquoWersquove a massive role to play, says Francesca, ldquobut we need everybody to recognize the importance of nature, whether thatrsquos on a micro or macro scale. Building that connection and providing the opportunities for iniduals and communities to participate is the rationale behind Make Space For Nature.ldquoVolunteering really matters for people and nature. We set ourselves a target of working with more than  dferent communities this year, with a particular focus on those who have been most impacted by the pandemic. Getting that community involvement builds into national decision making and larger interventions.With % of Scotlandrsquos population in towns and cities ndash and urban Scotland made up of % green space ndash there is massive potential to benefit both nature and people. Thatrsquos why NatureScot is increasingly investing in improving urban green spaces for people and nature through the Green Infrastructure Fund and supporting urban projects under the Bioersity Challenge Fund.Integral to this is their bid to reduce health inequalities in Scotlandrsquos cities by partnering with health and nature organisations to promote a range of green health activity, including new types of social prescribing. NatureScot is also investing in nature-rich parks and other types of green and blue spaces in our urban areas.ldquoWe use the term nature-based solutions, says Francesca, ldquobut that can be a range of dferent actions to help nature get a hold and be present in our towns and cities.The level of investment is substantial with the Green Infrastructure Fund totalling pound million of European Regional Development Funding, which requires match funding to create a programme worth pound million.Such investment pays idends.

I have been encouraged, though, by the new five per cent deposit mortgages the government are backing. I hope that could be really helpful.“Lenders are also starting to offer mortgages at five and a half times buyers’ earnings as opposed to four or four and a half times, so that will also help with how much people can borrow.”He added: “Because of the proximity to the schools and Portree it is not going to appeal to people who are looking to buy a holiday home. They want to be in the middle of nowhere.“I think it is going to appeal to people who are looking to buy it as their main home and want access to the schools and decent internet so they can work.”As an extra incentive the developer plans to connect all the houses via a full fibre GB broadband connection to the nearby BT exchange.“This connection will be provided by us completely free of charge for the first five years,” he added.“This is possible because the capacity we will have for the hotel is well beyond what we will need. This is still subject to BT surveys, though, but it is a realistic aspiration.”The housing scheme, which Mr Garton Jones describes as “an amalgam of Highland and Scandinavian culture” has been designed by Plockton-based architect Olli Blair, who caught the eye of the developer with his work on the Raasay Distillery building.Mr Garton Jones said he hoped to get on site by September October this year.The Bracken Hide Hotel is scheduled to open in April .If anyone is looking for more information on the homes or to register an interest they can contact Mr Garton Jones via charlie@gartonjones"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/WATERNISH-CYCLE-1.jpg","title":"waternish youngsters raise more than 7000 with","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoinePat Matheson from Halistra lost her husband Campbell to the illness, and her family thought it would be a good idea to raise funds for the charity in memory of Campbell and to raise awareness of AMMF.

Both the Woodland Trust and the Uig Community Trust were speaking today about how we can make a bigger impact through this event, and how we can cover the whole of the community.“There is real potential for the event to be an Uig clean as a whole and not just a beach clean.“A lot of people were saying that it was the first event that they had been to in well over a year, while some of the older people hadn’t seen anyone for months.“It was a real feel-good event from that side of things.“There was a mixture of working-age parents through to retired folks.“It was great to see the kids there and have a chat with their parents. The children were appalled at the amount of litter on the beach, and we were talking about what they can do to help. Getting the message across to them about these matters at an early stage is ideal.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Portree-View-scaled.jpg","title":"new skye homes to be sold at a fixed","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine revealed proposals by London-based developer Charlie Garton Jones to build  family homes in Portree on the site of the old golf course off the Struan Road.The plans,approved, will comprise  three-bedroom houses, and five four-bedroom houses, each with a garden and drive, situated on a site of around five acres in total.Mr Garton Jones lodged a planning application with Highland Council in late April this year, and hopes to provide homeowners with an ultrafast one gigabyte broadband connection free of charge for the first five years via the excess capacity the Bracken Hide Hotel will have from the nearby BT exchange.If given the green light, the scheme will be built on land next to where the developer is constructing his -cabin hotel, which is scheduled to open in April .Mr Garton Jones runs an independent estate agency specialising in the sale and rental of residential property in London, which has offices in Westminster, Nine Elms, Cha and Battersea.He also owns the Cow Shed boutique bunkhouse in Uig. report on Mr Garton Jones’ proposals has sparked a heated debate via the paper’s Facebook page over the last few days, attracting more than  comments.Although opinions dfered on the appearance of the houses, the main point of contention centred on whether the homes would be affordable and accessible to local people.Peter Brown commented: “The local community should have the final say. Personally I would think social housing should be a priority.”While Helen Grianan said: “Will these houses be £, or under  If not, they are not affordable housing for locals or key workers.”Calum J Morrison from North Uist was in favour of the scheme saying: “Sounds like a good type of thing in my opinion, the dude seems to know what he’s doing, good luck to him I say!”Annie B Campbell, meanwhile, highlighted broader issues with housing on the island, stating: “Key workers, like some NHS and teachers, are being outbid for most of the houses that come on the market in Skye.“They are not ‘officially’ homeless so do not have enough points to qualy for council housing.“Some are forced to skip between illegal short term lets. This is not simply a locals versus incomers issue.“Key workers coming to fill essential jobs on the island and local families need somewhere to live. There is a very real housing crisis.”Mr Garton Jones said the price of the houses could not be confirmed until planning permission was obtained.However, in the last few days, he took to social media to try to address worries that people on the island will be priced-out of buying the properties.“There has been a lot of focus on the larger family house we are hoping to build but  of the  houses we are building are smaller, three bedroom, houses,” he commented.Kevin McMahon simply asked: “Will there be a first refusal for locals and the children of local families ”In response, Mr Garton Jones said: “I am happy to confirm that the properties will not be sold via the Scottish ‘sealed bids offers over’ system but will be sold at a fixed price on a first-come, first-served basis.“Obviously until we have planning, we cannot sell the houses, but we have opened up a ‘waiting list’., which is the only place the houses have so far been mentioned or advertised – have emailed me to express their interest in the houses.“Many of them do, indeed, appear to be locals, although we will not be checking birth certicates as part of the sales process.”He added: “There are  houses in total, soyou would like your name added to the list, please email me via charlie@gartonjonesChisolm talked about his own chances of finding a home, questioned the effectiveness of the Highland Council in its current form, and underlined the importance of investing in smaller communities on the island.“I am living with my parents, and with my work I am fortunate to still live on Skye,” he said.“Saying that, I haven’t taken any steps to purchase a home as the prices do not justy the property, or are just too expensive.“I know people who have taken steps to purchase but were outbid either at the start or last minute.”Chisolm has worked for CalMac since  and says he has thought about moving to the Western Isles due to his poor prospects of finding a home on Skye.He said: “I have strong family connections to Lewis and Harris, and I might have the possibility of moving across as house prices haven’t been affected as much as on Skye in terms of second homes and holiday homes. However, it is now on the rise as on other neighbouring islands.”Chisolm believes a revamp of the local authority is needed to force meaningful change.“Skye is facing issues linked to the lack of investment and communications. That makes me question why are we governed by people in Inverness and not the people of Skye and the surrounding islands.“I look at the Western Isles, and I’m seeing housing developments across the islands in dferent areas with the goal of helping local people stay where they are from, sustaining school numbers — including Gaelic communities — and helping small areas grow.“That should be critical here and not just developing in Portree. Roads, housing, harbour investments are just a few aspects that link together and time is critical.”He added: “It’s very important for young people and young families to stay on the island with the support of affordable housing, whether that’s purchasing or renting.”Chisolm said he had been encouraged by responses to Iomairt an Eilein’s call to action.“Political responses ahead of the election have been very welcoming and we are grateful for the support,” he added. reported on plans to build a new -home private scheme on the outskirts of Portree.Commenting on the merits of the proposal, Chisolm said: “I welcome the new development in Portree, I’m sure many young people and families from Skye will benefit from thesethey are available at an affordable price.“That being said, I do question why we’re only developing in Portree. I can name many schools in surrounding communities that would benefit from even a half of a development like this.”Painting a stark picture of the dficulties facing townships such as Staffin, he said: “Smaller communities are missing out and our school numbers and Gaelic communities are suffering. This should be a wake-up call to our government and ‘our’ council that more housing investments in rural areas will have more of an impact and better outcomes.“We all have a right to articulate our viewpoints and opinions. Not everyone will agree but that’s what makes a community – having dferent voices for the benefit of our island.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3787297.jpg--.jpg?1620288585000\n","title":"seth raises 1340 for great cause","story":"A Ballymena teenager has raised more than pound for Macmillan Cancer Support after completing a half marathon at the weekend.

Credit: GettyAllan PrestonTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailFor Rory McIlroy and we Erica, the main order of business after celebrating his first win in  months was to comfort their eight-month old daughter Poppy.It was all too much for the tot, who found herself surrounded by cheering fans at the Wells Fargo Championship in North Carolina.Several well-known local parents told the Belfastthe public meltdown was a touching moment that seemed all too familiar.Two-time Olympic boxing bronze medallist Paddy Barnes recalled fleeing a restaurant when his daughter Eireann was two.I remember having my daughter out in Nando’s and she just squealed the place down,” he said.These two girls were coming over to me to help, but I just took her and split because everyone was looking at us.I felt really paranoid, because I felt like people were wanting us to shut up even though they were trying to help.I was just in a panic, I left with my dinner on the table. Now,my kids are crying, I wouldn’t mind as much because I’ve got more experience.”He added: “If I ever see parents with their kids crying out in public I just laugh because I can relate. There’s nothing you can do about it, it’s not the parents’ fault. Kids cry and there’s often nothing you can do about it.”On McIlroy, he said: “He’s very successful, so no doubt his baby will soon get used to it.”BBC presenting couple Connor Phillips and Holly Hamilton welcomed their son Fionn in January. Already behaving like a seasoned media professional, Connor said Fionn behaved perfectly at a recent event where his parents were working.He said: He times his little strops very well, just to make sure mummy and daddy look good. He has his moments too and can be a little a, so we do a lot of walking around the shore.Just today we were about a mile away from home and he unexpectedly woke up and he just wasn’t going back to sleep, full stop.”Asked how he deals with the stress of an upset child in public, he said: “I think back to my parentless self and think of how I might have reacted to seeing that. I might have rolled my eyes. But now as parents you go: ‘My God, the parents that have gone before me are absolute heroes’.I do think it’s the best thing in the world, though. He had a strop on the beach today and when we sat him up, he just seemed to say: ‘Thank you for that mummy and daddy’.”On McIlroy, he said: “I’m sure people think he has nannies and au pairs doing all the work. But I doubt that very much, I’m sure he’s a Holywood boy at heart looking after his wee man. I now have % empathy with parents, they’re terric, especially mums!” Comedians Diona Doherty and Sean Hegarty welcomed their daughter Winter five weeks ago. The Derry Girls and Give My Head Peace actress said feeling safe while out in public during the pandemic had been her biggest obstacle.“Today was the first day I took my daughter to the shopping centre, which was quite daunting. I know other parents who had babies during lockdown but haven’t really been anywhere for six months. That’s probably even scarier,” she said.Diona gave birth while having Covid, but now feels somewhat safer that both of them have some immunity.Any time we’re out for a walk it’s the same, it’s been cut short. Our baby has a set of lungs on her. Luckily I’m breastfeeding, so I can console her quite quickly. But you’re always planning ahead for the quickest route back.”Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Sinn Fein ‘crushed our sister’: Family criticise party over Martina Anderson ‘humiliation’Rory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Rory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtEx-DUP councillor faces payout over Ballymurphy massacre libelTop VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest Northern IrelandMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageInnocent finding for Ballymurphy victims welcomed by deputy First MinisterSir Alex Ferguson on sectarianism, a brush with death and why he only supports Rangers Ten killed in west Belfast in  were ‘entirely innocent’ – coronerJohnson’s Government urged to fulfil promises to Troubles veteransLatestDeclan BogueOpinionWhy getting out to live sport will always be better than watching on the TVUlster duo join injury list ahead of Rainbow Cup trip to LeinsterMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageInnocent finding for Ballymurphy victims welcomed by deputy First MinisterLaid-off workers should ‘top the queue’ for liquidation payouts, says TD,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott   Belfast Suzanne BreenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen -year-old Kate Nicholl arrived in Belfast with her mother having fled Zimbabwe, she never dreamed she would end up its Lord Mayor. “My mum had £ in her purse. Without the help of the Gingerbread charity for single parents, I don’t know how we’d have coped,” she says. “We got a flat on the th floor of Riverdale House tower block in Dunmurry. It all seemed very grey. My whole world had collapsed. My parents’ marriage had broken up previously, and now we had left our home and were in a dferent country.When our belongings were shipped over, someone set fire to the boxes outside the flat. We literally lost everything, including photographs. I found it all very traumatic.”In three weeks’ time Katewill be installed as Belfast’s new Alliance Lord Mayor. The daughter of a Northern Ireland artist and a writer and ex-model from a family of anti-apartheid activists in South Africa, her story is extraordinary.“My mum and dad met at a house party in London in the s,” she says. “They were both hippies. My dad Kenneth was an artist from Holywood in Co Down. My mum, who was from Capetown, was working as a nanny.“They were both liberal and bohemian, and had found the places they’d grown up extremely restrictive. It was a whirlwind romance, but my mum Helen had to go back to South Africa as her visa was about to expire.“Back in Capetown, she wanted toto London. My grandparents, very sensibly, refused to fund a trip for their -year-old daughter to hook up with a man she’d just met. My mum had been an artists’ model and had sat for a well-known painter. She sold the portrait to buy a plane ticket to London to be with dad.”Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate Nicholl at school in Zimbabwe FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate Nicholl at school in ZimbabweThe couple got married and moved to Brighton. But, for some reason, they decided toto Northern Ireland where Kate’s brother Daniel and sister Ciara were born. Kenneth worked as an art teacher, and Helen secured a job in the children’s department of Robinson and Cleaver.“In  they decided they couldn’t stay here any longer,” Kate says. “The violence and sectarianism was too much. They didn’t want their children growing up in a segregated environment.“My dad started writing to dferent countries to see where he might get a job. Zimbabwe was this newly independent country that needed teachers. My parents were very excited about what Robert Mugabe stood for. It was also close to South Africa for my mum to visit her family.”The Nicholls moved to Harare before settling in the small farming town of Marondera. Kate was born there six years later. “It was a wonderful and magical childhood in so many ways,” she says.“My dad was the art teacher in the local school, and my mum the librarian. My parents were very creative and had interesting friends. There was a lot of sport — swimming and canoeing down the Zambezi.There was endless bushland to roam around. It was the most stunning landscape. I can still see the night sky with stars that seemed to go on forever. I can smell the sweet scent of the jacaranda trees in bloom.“But it was a strange environment as well. There was a lot of racism. It was very unusual for a white family like ours to have black friends. I was the only white child at school who had black classmates over to stay at the weekend. It was a totally unnatural society.”In South Africa, Kate’s grandmother had been in the Black Sash, an organisation of white women which campaigned against apartheid. They would wear black sashes to symbolise mourning for the death of democracy.Kate’s brother left Zimbabwe for university in Capetown, and her sister went to college in Belfast. Her parents’ marriage then broke up, and her father also ed to Northern Ireland.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate with husband Fergal Sherry FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate with husband Fergal Sherry“It was just me and mum left,” she says. “The political situation started to get really tense. White farmers were being abducted and beaten. David Stevens, the father of a school friend, was shot dead.There were food and fuel shortages, and riots.My mum drove to town to fill her car with petrol. She waited two hours in a queue but, when she got to the front, there was none left.“She came home to find the electricity was out in another power cut. In a dark, empty house, she reached for the phone, and the lines were down. So she got into bed with a bottle of gin and decided it was time for us to leave.”When her parents had arrived in Zimbabwe, it was “a country full of political hope”, Kate says. “As a child, I wrote in my diary that Robert Mugabe was my hero. As things deteriorated, I scribbled that out and replaced him with Nelson Mandela.“Mugabe did some incredible things, but there were a lot of awful things too. Land reform was definitely needed, but he didn’t go about it the right way.There was brutality and massacres. Elections were rigged and corruption was widespread.“Land seizures destroyed the economy. Middle-class whites like us left. It was poor black Zimbabweans who were hardest hit. This beautul country, and its long-suffering people, deserved so much better.”And so in , Kate and Helen Nicholl moved into their flat in Dunmurry. “My mother is an extraordinary woman,” she says. “At  years old, with no money, no job and no friends, she was starting all over again.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseKate with her son Cian FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueKate with her son Cian“Being a white African is textbook privilege. I grew up where people had horses and huge farms. But I do know what it’s like not to have money, and to worry about it. I know that le can change very quickly and you have to rely on the support and kindness of others, and being welcomed and embraced.”Kate was sent to the very middle-class Methodist College where family and financial circumstances combined to make her feel “like an outsider for years”. Eventually, she settled in.“My mum got a job in the War On Want bookshop in Botanic Avenue. It didn’t pay well, but she loved it. She built up a friendship circle with volunteers and customers. They became a second family to me.“We moved to Sunnyside Street, off the Ormeau Road, where a Georgian piano player lived next door. When she practised, we imagined ourselves to be sitting on the veranda in Marondera at dusk, listening to my sister play.”After her A-levels Kate moved in with her dad, who had cancer, to help nurse him. She then decided to go to university in London: “I still felt an outsider in Northern Ireland because of my background and accent, and I had every intention of never ing to live here again.“I decided to study anthropology because my favourite uncle in South Africa was an anthropologist, and he had the best stories. I thought I’d love London, but every time I came back to Northern Ireland to visit my family I realised that this place was home. Belfast was where I belonged.”After graduation Kate moved back here permanently. She started waitressing, and applied to do a law conversion course at Queen’s University. She also wrote to Alliance South Belfast MLA Anna Lo askingshe could do work experience in her office.Kate identied strongly with the politician from Hong Kong as someone like her who had come from abroad to make Northern Ireland her home: “She was the first person I voted for.“I respected her pro-choice stance on abortion at a time when not many people here held that position. Anna agreed to have me in for a day a week, and that turned into two days, and then it became the entire week.“A full-time job came up. I applied, got it, and forgot all about the law course. I never intended to join Alliance. I didn’t think I was suited to being a member of any political party as I was very much my own woman and I always thought it would limit me.“But the  flag protests changed my mind. They were a cynical and orchestrated move by loyalists, apparently in response to a democratic decision taken by the council, but really because Naomi Long had won the Westminster seat in East Belfast.“I saw Alliance’s office in Carrickfergus burnt down. I saw the home of a young councillor couple attacked as their baby slept inside. I decided to join the party to show solidarity with these brave and dignied people.”In  Kate was co-opted onto Belfast City Council. At the election three years later she topped the poll in the Balmoral ward. On a night out with an SDLP member in the Duke of York pub in Belfast city centre, she met her future husband, “GAA-mad accountant from Aghadrumsee in Co Fermanagh” Fergal Sherry.“I tapped this boy on the shoulder and asked him to take a photo of us on my phone. He did, and as he handed it back to me he remarked that we followed each other on Twitter. Apparently, we’d had quite a strong clash of opinion on something. We still have dferent views on certain issues, but we share similar values.“Fergal proposed in Zimbabwe in a small game reserve I’d visited on school trips. We were on top of a rock overlooking the savanna at sunset. It was perfect. I felt like I’d come full circle with my old and new lives.”The couple have a one-year-old son, Cian. “He’s had a political baptism of fire,” Kate says. “He attended his first council committee meeting at four weeks.He was breastfed in the chamber at seven weeks, and was in a BBC studio at eight weeks as we discussed the trolling I’d received for taking him into the chamber the previous week.”Kate has been chosen as a running-mate for Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw in South Belfast in next year’s Assembly election.The party will be hoping that public exposure from being Lord Mayor will enhance her chances. It’s a fascinating constituency with the SDLP, Alliance, Sinn Fein, DUP and Greens currently each holding a seat.The SDLP will also be aiming to follow up on Claire Hanna’s spectacular Westminster win in  by having two MLAs elected. The Sinn Fein or Green seats would appear to be the most vulnerable.Kate says poverty is an issue high on her agenda. “It has grown during Covid, and there must be a long-term Government plan to tackle systemic injustice. It’s not just about handing out food parcels.If your washing-machine has broken, and your kids can’t go to school in clean clothes, a food parcel won’t help you. If you live in an empty house, it’s a bed and sofa you need, not a food parcel.“And no politician should ever have their photo taken outside a food bankthey’re not working to address the causes of inequality.”Kate says digital poverty is also an issue: “As we live more and more online, the internet should be free to everyone. Families don’t need one device per household.They need devices for all their children, they need money for electricity and data.”Her theme as Lord Mayor will be ‘Our Belfast’, she says: “We are one community and we have one city. We need to shine a light on its people and organisations, and instil a sense of collective responsibility.We must make sure the marginalised, and those who feel outsiders, know it’s their city too.For many people, Belfast is still steeped in the past and the Troubles. But for me, it’s a place of sanctuary.It’s somewhere I started my le over again. It’s a resilient, warm and welcoming city. I am delighted to call it my home, and I will be so proud to be its Lord Mayor.”Belfast Most ReadAdrian Dunbar and top Orangeman Mervyn Gibson split over Ireland in Sinn Fein ‘crushed our sister’: Family criticise party over Martina Anderson ‘humiliation’Rory wins Wells Fargo Championship but not everyone was happy Rory McIlroy pays tribute to we Erica and mum Rosie after Wells Fargo Championship win ends  month title droughtEx-DUP councillor faces payout over Ballymurphy massacre libelTop VideosPlayVideo: Lisa Dorrian murder suspect Mark Smyth taking Sunday Le’s lie detector testPlayVideo: Finn McCool caught on camera at the Giant’s Causeway!PlayWorld’s largest cargo plane leaves Belfast with oxygen generators for India to help Covid crisisLatest Northern IrelandBallymurphy massacre victims ‘innocent, posed no threat and unconnected to paramilitaries,’ coroner findsMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageInnocent finding for Ballymurphy victims welcomed by deputy First MinisterSir Alex Ferguson on sectarianism, a brush with death and why he only supports Rangers Ten killed in west Belfast in  were ‘entirely innocent’ – coronerLatestDeclan BogueOpinionWhy getting out to live sport will always be better than watching on the TVUlster duo join injury list as remaining Rainbow Cup fixtures announcedBallymurphy massacre victims ‘innocent, posed no threat and unconnected to paramilitaries,’ coroner findsPimp admits killing teenager in Student berated by father over British fascist documentary, court told,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.\",\"keywords\":\"free articles,Kenny Shiels,Northern Ireland,Roys Chicks,Maghera,Derry City,Soccer\",\"articleSection\":\"Home\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"Maghera man Kenny Shiels transformed theNorthern Ireland womens team, without a win for four years, to qualy for next summers European Championships.

Michael McMullan sat down to hear his story...From Kenny Shiels front door, through the hall and kitchen, into the sun-room of his Maghera home sets the scene. A framed Northern Ireland jersey on the wall. Snaps of his son Dean in the colours of Rangers and Hibernian, with three outstretched fingers symbolising his hat-tricks. A glistening picture of Kenny and Dean, grinning from ear to ear, with the Scottish League Cup after Kilmarnocks  success, sticks out from a row of framed mementos. There is no doubt this is a football house. Dean is now the manager of Dungannon Swts. His other son, Jody, manages the local cross community team Upperlands Aces where Kenny is the Chairman. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a title,” he admits. Football is in the blood. “I mark out the pitch, cut the grass...just trying to keep them going.” One of his daughters, Lauren, is married to Coleraine manager Oran Kearney. Armagh City manager Shea Campbell is married to Grace. His we Gwens brothers were footballers. You soon get the picture of the football discussion bouncing around the dinner table. On a Thursday afternoon, on the same day he signed a two-year extension to his contract as Northern Ireland womens manager, Shiels welcome is a warm one. He sips on a cuppa, relaxed, just shooting the breeze. Talking football comes naturally. googletag.cmd.push It was always football, even at the age of two. In hospital for a hernia operation, Kenny cried his eyes out. His mother, Elizabeth, tried to pacy him. But, it wasnt the pain, rather, someone had taken his ball. Once it was ed, the tears stopped. “It must be in my genes somewhere...I was football mad,” Kenny utters. He turned  weeks ago, but the glint remains in his eye. Before Covid- took hold, he was a regular at the nearby leisure centre. The mantra is early to bed, early to rise and practice what you preach. Another passion is music. Tucked in the corner of the kitchen is a record player, with a selection of LPs. Front of the pile is his favourite, John Prine.     “Music is just great,” Kenny offers, painting a picture of the power generated by Labi Sfres Something Inside So Strong. As the Northern Ireland team are about to leave their hotel, the words of the song set the scene. The song changes, depending on the atmosphere. The words and crescendo...they both matter. Shiels gained a degree in psychology along his footballing journey. As he speaks, he picks his words well. An hour in his company gives a taste of how Northern Ireland women, who went four years without a win, will mix with Europes elite next summer. *** Shiels first gig in management came in Beagh Primary School at the age of eight. The nearby, much bigger, Maghera County school came to play a friendly match. “Shiels...pick that team,” bellowed Principal Mr Gillen. “It was a hiding to nothing,” said Shiels of the game, in which he helped himself to five goals in an eight all draw. “There were no tactics,” Kenny laughs. “I got the ball and dribbled. They were trying to kick lumps out of me, but couldnt get near me.” Football was never away from the family home on a chicken farm on the outskirts of Maghera. Kenny was fourth of nine children, which included eight boys. Their father Roy had installed lights in the front yard. Every Saturday night, theyd re-emerge after Match of the Day, singing the tune as they raced outside, playing until after midnight. “My father was a Unionist Councillor...this town was polarised at one time,” Kenny points out. Roy Shiels was able to drink in any of the  pubs in Maghera. One of the few that could. “He got houses for everybody, no matter what creed they were...he was a very popular man.” With a deep interest in football, Roy formed a team comprising Catholics from the upper part of the town and Protestants from the bottom end. “He was bringing communities together to go and compete together in a sporting environment,” Kenny proudly states. “They came together and became friends to this day. Larry Cudden, who played for us, texted me a few minutes ago.” Roy took a cattle trailer, with the whole team in it and sometimes a couple in the boot of the car. It wouldnt conform with todays regulations. Roys Chicks, as they were called, hammered everyone in sight in tournaments across the North. After bagging seven goals in a game, Kenny was accused of being overage. The following year, the Chicks went international, on a five-day trip to France. Seamus Heffron, a French teacher on his year out, helped Roy organise the trip, which was funded by a raffle for a ball signed by the England and Spanish national teams. “Off they went to France, in the late seventies,” said Kenny, now too old to go. “Children got to Portrush for a weekend and that was it.” Kenny was football mad and sneaked away for a fleeting Gaelic football spell with Glen minors in , at the height of the troubles. On the Saturday evening hed leave a kitbag in a lane near his home. The following morning, his mother would have him kitted out in a shirt and tie for Sunday school. “I would change into my ordinary clothes and go on to a game,” he recalls. “Playing Gaelic, when I think back at the height of the troubles, I was mincemeat. It was a brave thing to do.” While his toe to hand wasnt up to scratch as a newcomer to the game, he just dribbled his way through defences. *** An ankle injury at the age of  threatened to end the promising Shiels football career. Medical advice told him to hang up his boots, but he ploughed on. He went on to play for Distillery, Coleraine, Ballymena and Larne in the Irish league. In his third spell with Tobermore United, as player manager, he brought home silverware before a call out of the blue gave him his big break in management. “It was the day of my fathers funeral,” Kenny remembers. “I can still see it. I came home from the funeral, I was hanging up my coat and the phone rang.” Bottom of the table Carrick Rangers were offering him the manager post. The following season, he led them to the County Antrim Shield. After a semi-final win over Glenavon, they defeated then league champions Glentoran in the final. “That was a fantastic giant killing act,” he said of their - replay win. The Glens had taken English professional player Billy Whitehirst for the final, whereas Kenny built a team by dipping into local junior clubs Roe Valley, Dungiven and Magherafelt Sky Blues. Brian Martin scored the first goal, with David Montgomery netting the winner. When Felix Healy resigned as Coleraine manager midway through the   season, a Bannsiders fan like his father, Shiels was headhunted to steer the ship. Coleraine narrowly missed out on a place in the top flight, as the old -team ision split into two leagues for the first time. The following season, with his younger brother Sammy banging in the goals, Kenny got Coleraine promoted and won the inaugural Irish News Cup, a competition for North West Clubs in the Irish League and League of Ireland. After six years with Coleraine, he had a spell with Moyola Park before taking charge of Ballymena United in mid-season. He was unable to save them from the drop to the second tier. After two seasons, which saw them finish as low as fth, Shiels rebuilt the team. His now son in law Shea Campbell was leading the attack when they gained promotion and with ex Nottingham Forest striker Nigel Jemson on board, they finished sixth in the top flight and qualied for Europe via the Intertoto Cup. Following a draw with Danish side Odense, they lost the second leg. After leaving the Showgrounds, Kenny took over at Larne, but at the time, he was appointed as manager of Northern Ireland Us, who he steered to the  European Championships. “That was the only time they qualied for Europe,” said Shiels. “We beat Belgium away and Scotland away to qualy, that was massive.” At the tournament in France, Northern Ireland came up against a Cesc Fagravebregas-led Spain and the hosts that included Karim Benzema. The eight years with the Us helped him secure a job in England, the Head of Youth at Tranmere Rovers, where he stayed for three seasons before taking over as Mixu Paatelainens number two at Kilmarnock. When Paatelainen moved to take charge of Finland, Shiels was promoted to manager. The  season proved to be a fantastic season. He became the first Killie manager to beat Rangers twice in one season. Ally McCoist was looking to equal an -year record by going  away games unbeaten, but Kilmarnock overturned them at Rugby Park. When the sides met in thefixture at a packed Ibrox, Shiels son Dean scored the  minute winner. In the League Cup, Kilmarnock went all the way to their final meeting with Celtic at Hampden Park without conceding a goal. Goalkeeper Cammy Bells inspirational performance kept a clean sheet in the decider. Shiels brought Lee Johnston and Dieter Van Tornhout off the bench, with both combining for the latter to score the winning goal to take the title and cap off a fine season. Kenny and Dean Shiels celebrate Kilmarnocks  Scottish Cup success. The following season, Shiels led Killie to victory over Celtic at Parkhead, but after finishing ninth in the table, triggering a get-out clause, allowed the club to sack him,they ended up in the bottom four. It sparked protests by fans, disappointed with the clubs decision. Shiels had spells at Scottish side Greenock Morton and BEC Tero Sasana in Thailand, before joining Derry City in . In his first two seasons, the Candystripes finished third and fourth, qualying for lucrative spots in Europe, where they beat Dinamo Minsk. “What a result that was,” Kenny said of the win. “It was the first game in their new refurbished stadium and I later took Northern Irelandback there when we played Belarus.” In his third season in charge, Derry City finished third bottom of the table following a poor run of results. Shiels delivered the League Cup, their last piece of silverware. His son Dean was again part of the success in a - victory over Cobh Ramblers at the Brandywell. It wasnt enough to save his job. His tenure as manager coincided with the death of Derry skipper and club legend Ryan McBride, something that affected him badly. Kenny read out an emotional poem, In Your Absence, at Ryans funeral, which was greeted with a rapturous applause. “We lost eight players in the August of the third year,” Kenny states. “They wanted away some of them. I made a couple of bad signings, which you do.” Part of him wanted to stay, but he sensed an element of the dressing room wasnt in his corner. “I felt it,” he admits. “Ive always prided myself in having a good dynamic in the dressing room. In the professional game, you have a term where you are doing well and a term when it is not so good.” The mutual decision saw them part ways. He knows that bad times are inevitable. It could happen in his current role. “It happens to everybody,” Kenny admits. *** Carrick Rangers win over Glentoran was a seismic result in its own right, but one thing pleased Kenny Shiels more, watching his side pass them off the pitch. “I had a style of play and I still have it,” Kenny now states. “We got on the ball and we play, with our passing style and patterns.” He enjoys the tactical side of the game, but taking charge of Northern Ireland women was a dferent preposition. Transforming them into the first side to qualy for the European Championships is top of the tree in a footballing career that is glittered with success. “If you dig deep into it,” Kenny explains. “These girls hadnt won a match in almost four years, prior to us coming in.” Magherafelts Simone Magilland Rebecca Hollowayare the sole professional players. Sarah McFadden, also from Magherafelt, plays part-time with Durham. The rest are amateur. The fallow spell had corroded any bleak sign of confidence. Standing in Greenmount College, with felt tip pen in hand, their new manager steered his sides mentality in a very definite direction. Two words were etched onto the flip-chart...trust and integrity. His two cornerstones. “You cant have one without the other and I told them they were the focal points in their time with me,” Shiels said. “Thats what we work off, in everything we do. They are related to team spirit and teamwork in any sport.” Even now, sitting on his sofa, reciting that first meeting, his eyes are dancing. You can see how he was able to hold a team in the palm of his hand. It wasnt about just trusting each other. The squad needed to believe in the staff, the process of improvement. But, most of all, they had to trust themselves. “You cant get better without trust,” he told them. “The best and most important relationship you can have anywhere in the world, with any person...is the relationship with yourself. “If you dont trust and believe in yourself, and you havent got a strong relationship with yourself, youll never achieve anything in your le.” Shiels had to pick them off the canvas. Unlike a club environment, there is no transfer market. It was a case of building a team from scratch. In the opposite corner, they were pitting themselves against players from Barcelona and Lyon, stars from the top English clubs, Manchester City, Arsenal and Cha. “Wales, who we eliminated over two games, they have a full team, maybe  of them, playing in the Womens Super League,” Shiels adds. Their resolve was tested by two - defeats by former European and World Champions Norway, either side of their two draws with Wales. “My full backs go forward, we play an attacking game,” Shiels points out. “Norway beat us - in Belfast, but in the second half, we had the same or more possession than them and it was a great learning curve.” Northern Ireland finished the group with four wins, twice each against Belarus and the Faroe Islands to book their play-off with Ukraine. Simone Magill and Rachel Furness celebrate Northern Irelands - win over Belarus in the Dinamo National Olympic Stadium, Minsk.  As part of the preparations, Shiels accepted an approach to play England in St Georges Park, something seen as a gamble of sorts. After rebuilding the confidence, a hiding, by more than six goals, couldve set them back. Trailing - after facing a stf breeze, Northern Ireland played much better in the second-half but went down - in the end, but Shiels was happy. It was another learning curve. Going into the first leg of the play-off, Shiels had four players out with cruciate ligament injuries, Lauren Wade had an ankle injury and goalscorer Rachel Furness hobbled off minutes with a broken ankle. A Magill goal saw Shiels side come home with a - win from Ukraine before winning - in the second leg, to book their place in the finals. “They have  million of a population and have recently been in the finals,” he said of Ukraines pedigree. Of the  teams in next summers finals, ranked by coefficient, only Scotland from the top  ranked teams have failed to qualy. Northern Ireland are ranked th. “We are in with the big shots now,” Shiels points out. The rankings are based on results, discipline, performances, essentially anything quantiable. “The coefficient we got in the fth year, was twice as much as the other four years combined. That is massive.” He has come a long way from dribbling through the tackles on the tarmac of Beagh Primary School, but Shiels is still leading the way. And hes far from finished.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dr Glynn said he is hopeful that additional measures will not be required for the county in the coming weeks and he is confident that the situation in Donegal will improve quickly. He was speaking at a press briefing for the media in Donegal on Wednesday following the fallout from comments made by chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan last Friday about the high incidence of Covid- in the county. googletag.cmd.push There has been a backlash in Donegal to the tone of the comments Dr Holohan made when he said there were concerns about things happening in the county that “even the dogs on the street” know shouldn’t be happening. Figures released at the press briefing put the national incidence rate in the county at  cases per , people compared to a national rate of . The highest rates are in the Milford local electoral area at . and the Letterkenny area where the rate is .. The lowest rate in the county is in the Donegal LEA at .. The briefing was told there were  GP referrals for testing in the county on Tuesday, an increase of % on the same day last week. googletag.cmd.push Dr Glynn said the concerns were raised last week so that people can take protective measures and ensure the situation does not get worse. He said there is a bigger number of smaller clusters in Donegal than in other parts of the country. “It was not meant as blame. It certainly was not made as a threat,” he said. “It would be very strange for us to preside over a situation where incidence is very high and increasing in a county and not draw attention to that.” At the briefing, director of public health for the HSE in the north-west, Dr Anthony Breslin, highlighted a number of clusters that have occurred due to events in the county in recent weeks, including awake, a family gathering and an th birthday party.     The events resulted in dozens of cases and infections in workplaces, in families and at a school. One social gathering has been linked to  cases of Covid-, he said. Dr Glynn said that there are concerns about the situation in the county and that some people in Donegal have “pushed the boundaries”. “We are concerned about the current incidence. That is not to say that Donegal has not come a very long way over the past number of months, just as the rest of the country has, and that can only have happened because the majority of people are trying to do the right thing,” he said. “This is not in any way a reflection on the majority but clearly there are a number of incidents where people have pushed the boundaries. “We have seen that in other counties, it is not just in Donegal. But I suppose the dference at the moment versus some other places where we have particularly high incidences, is that there are large clusters driving incidences. “In Donegal, it seems to be a little bit more widespread with a bigger number of smaller clusters which makes it that little bit harder to control. Sowe can continue to emphasise, andwe can get people who have been pushing the boundaries a little bit just to comply that bit more over the coming weeks, we should see incidence drop quickly in Donegal.” He said we can not get away from the fact that the high incidence rates in parts of the county are due to the fact the disease is being transmitted from person to person. “It gets transmitted from person to person when people come into contact with one another and when for whatever reason masks are not worn, distance is not kept, people who are symptomatic don’t self-isolate. “Right now we are seeing a higher incidence in Donegal than we have in other parts of the country and in that regard, it is incumbent on us as doctors to point out our concerns so that people can take proactive actions because there are many people who remain very vulnerable to this disease over the coming weeks,” he said. “All we are asking people in Donegal to do is to protect themselves and their families. We are not proposing any dferent measures for any one part of Donegal as things currently stand, and I would be hopeful and optimistic given the level of engagement over the past number of days that we wont be looking at some sort of additional measures for the county or any part of the county over the coming weeks.” He said the priority for people over the coming weeks is to meet people outside. “As far as is possible at all, do not meet up with friends or extended families or do not have parties inside. Inside gives this virus such an advantage in terms of transmission,” he said. “Last January Donegal had an incidence of , per ,. It is now  per ,. It is the highest in the country but it’s an order of magnitude lower than where it was and that’s down to the work of the majority doing most of the right things most of the time.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Mairead Healy, who is originally from Meenan Park in the Bogside area, was successful in last Thursdays council election in Romsey, a town with a population of around , people which is located seven miles from Southampton in the south of England. Speaking after her success, she said her thoughts were with her late mother Frances, brother and grandmother. She said: “I am over the moon that the people of Romsey have placed their trust in me to represent them for the Labour Party. googletag.cmd.push “As most people who know me will know, I’m not there simply to make up the numbers and I’m looking forward to rolling up my sleeves and getting stuck in - and maybe shaking things up a bit too.” She added: “For now, feeling so incredibly blessed and grateful to so many people who believed in me and who got out on the streets in the hail, wind and rain to canvas for me and the rest of the Romsey candidates. Thank you. “I’m also thinking about my mum, my wee brother Eamonn and my granny. It’s days like these when you really feel their absence, as they have missed out on so many of me and my sister Orla Oacute hEacuteiliacute’s big le events. googletag.cmd.push “But I’ve no doubt they have been watching over us from heaven and helping us along the way from up above.” Mairead left Derry  years ago to study law in the UK and has held several important positions, starting off her career working for the European Commission in Brussels. She then worked in human rights in London before making a career change and moving to Dublin to lead a national youth charity for several years. After that, she moved to the south of England where she was chief executive of a youth mental health service and was appointed to the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, a role she has recently stepped down from.     Currently, she works for a major international human rights organisation where she is part of the leadership team. She is also a postgrad student at Cambridge, training to be a child therapist and is head of safeguarding with Amnesty International UK, a post she has held since September . She said being brought up in Derry during The Troubles and the events of Bloody Sunday inspired her to get involved in struggles for justice and become an advocate for those without a voice. She said: “Growing up in the ’s as a working class Catholic from the Bogside during The Troubles in Northern Ireland, I was very much aware of the civil rights struggle affecting my community, particularly as the events of Bloody Sunday took place just a few streets from my home, where civil rights demonstrators were murdered by the British army. “As a result, it instilled in me from a young age a strong desire to be involved in struggles for justice and advocating for those without a voice. “In addition, as an adult, I also experienced some le changing events through the loss of some of my close family members in traumatic circumstances, which also affected my decision to campaign on particular areas of inequality.” She added she was really privileged to be able to work with and volunteer with ious communities over the years including Traveller groups, survivors of institutional abuse, refugees, iniduals who, she said, were homeless, young people and iniduals whose human rights are denied to them. She added: “As a result, I strongly believe in the value of grassroots capacity building to ensure that those without a voice can be supported to advocate for themselves and ensure their voices are heard and represented in decision making.” She explained her reasons for standing for election. “It goes without saying that the implications of the pandemic will be felt for many years to come and there will be signicant economic consequences of this, combined with Brexit. “I want to play my part in ensuring our communities are supported in the years ahead, which is why I am putting myself forward as a candidate.”   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy.

For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go.

They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Eaacutebha Mullanand Ciaroacuten Mullan , from Ballerin, have written about the loss of their father Kieran Squealer Mullan in , when the siblings were just five and three years old. Ahead of a k sponsored run this weekend in aid of the Mental Health Awareness charity, Eaacutebha and Ciaroacutens mother, Collette, has shared her childrens plea to break the taboo around mens mental health. “On May  , it will be  years since Ciaroacuten and I last saw our Daddy. With cold shock, I realise that means hes been gone for  years longer than I knew him,” wrote Eaacutebha. googletag.cmd.push “We were only five and three when he took his own le. For many people, a period of time relieves much of the pain, and makes it easier to move on. “But for us, in many ways, its got worse. Losing a parent at five and three meant we didnt really understand death. I didnt even know it was suicide until I was in P. “Our Daddys death has left us with years of unsolved questions, new and fresh situations to face without a father. “Even from the day he died, we are still finding out new things about him to add to the tiny memories we thankfully have. Five years is no time to know someone well. googletag.cmd.push “I wish we could go back to those days when we were just a little boy and girl, too young to notice how down our Daddy really was. Eaacutebha has posted details of the sponsored runs route on social media. “I wish we could spread them throughout the rest of our lives knowing what people are thinking and going through, hoping we could help them in any possible way. “Why cant we swap the day he held us as a baby at our Christening, so he could watch us play Gaelic, win big matches and watch us succeed in le  “Ten years on and we are still listening to his favourite songs, watching the one existing video of him to remember his voice, crying on Fathers Day or his birthday, or any random day.     “We still cant let our Daddy go. Everyone thinks we might have moved on, because it happened such a long time ago. “But they dont know how it feels to look at the same few photographs, knowing there will never be any more. “They dont know how strange it feels to think we once had two parents. They dont know what its like to sit and talk to your Daddy at a gravestone at  and  knowing that he didnt want to be here. “If we let him go, hes gone forever, and we cant take that. The effect of suicide isnt just the loss of the person who left you behind, its the shadow always at your heel.” Eaacutebha and Ciaroacuten have shared their story in the hope it will help others to speak out about their mental health. “Ten years on, and suicide is still the leading cause of death for men under ,” said Eaacutebha. “Every day, men who feel like our Daddy did bottle up their feelings, try to appear strong, and drive themselves further into darkness. “Every day,  of them take their lives, leaving people like Ciaroacuten and I lost and heartbroken. And every day, we wish we could change what happened. “For our Daddy, the sun will never come out again, but the more we talk about it, the more we listen, the more others will live to see another day and the more the shadows will fade.”] The k sponsored run in memory of Kieran Squealer Mullan will take place on Sunday May , with all proceeds going to the Mental Health Awareness charity.

Brooke McEldowney, a Primary One pupil at St Brigids Tirkane Bunscoil Naomh Briacuted, has appeared in Three Families, part one of which aired last night. Three Families explores the emotive issues around womens rights and tells the story of the grassroots campaign to lt Northern Irelands restrictions on abortion. Brooke enjoying herself on set. Brooke landed the role after her mum Kirsty received an email from a casting agency. “When I opened an email about NI filming and how they were on the lookout for a young child, Brooke fitted the description,” she told Derry Now. googletag.cmd.push “It was all very overwhelming as the world was going through a pandemic and my daughter was now going to be part of a cast. It all felt like a dream.” For Brooke, the dream was very much a reality, and although she began filming at just four years of age, the young County Derry girl made light of the heavy schedule.  “She has been such a busy girl, taking everything in her stride and having so many dferent roles in filming and completely loving it all,” said Kirsty. “During the lockdowns while everyone was at home, I was arranging my other kids childcare and driving to our next destination for long days ahead. googletag.cmd.push “She had attended local drama and dance classes for a short while - pre-Covid - so this helped. She loved all the attention and getting chauffeured to each set, a few places I never expected to be.” Five-year-old Brooke has a central role in the drama as the daughter of actor Colin Morgan, previously of The Fall and actress Amy James Kelly, who has previously featured in Coronation Street. “When I met them and signed the contracts I knew that this was a big deal and how I had to keep everything a secret,” said Kirsty. “I had to travel myself to each set every couple of days prior filming to get a Covid test. Thankfully, they were all negative so Brooke could always continue with her role.”     The future is already looking bright for the Maghera girl, and she was handed a unique birthday present in February when she began filming on a CBBC musical drama series. “It was so perfect and fitting on her th birthday and the cast, producers and directors spoiled her,” said Kirsty. “Her confidence rapidly grew and has been even given spoken lines for on screen. She has gained multiple jobs since and has now been signed up by an agency.” Brooke on set with Colin Morgan and Amy James Kelly. Keeping her feet on the ground amid the excitement of her new-found fame will be an easy task with the support of her community and her school. “When ing to school after lockdown Brooke had days off due to filming but the BBC always liaised so well with the school,” said Kirsty. “Brooke is a very independent, intelligent girl and likes a good routine. She was thrilled when her teacher, Mrs Convery sent work via Seesaw and was always keen to get the tasks completed. “We are so proud and it has been an emotional journey as I have been involved in the Arts for many years and know how challenging it can be. “It’s all such an amazing experience and the opportunities it has opened for her have been remarkable.

Jamsie Martin hit - from play in the first half, as the home side shot into a - to - interval lead, but they had to thank goalkeeper Gavin Tonra for his two point blank saves to deny Paddy Bradley.

Trevor Smullen netted for Longford as Derry led - to - at the break. The game was still in its first minute when Bradley took advantage of a defensive mistake to fire the ball into the net. In injury-time Bradley netted from the penalty spot after he was fouled. The gap increased to three early in the second half before Longford hit four points without reply. David Barden wasted an excellent goal chance for Longford and Derry took advantage as Joe Diver pointed. But Longford fought back and edged ahead after three unanswered points only for Paddy Bradley to equalise.

Qualiers RLongford - Derry -Longford earned a dramatic win in a chaotic finish at Pearse Park. There was controversy too. Derrys Barry McGoldrick, who had marauded forward from corner-back to grab two goals, picked up a second yellow card after a melee in the Longford goalmouth in the th minute of injury time. Minutes later, Derry sub Joe Diver scored a goal reminiscent of Joe Sheridans against Louth two previously - this time referee Michael Duffy awarded a free out and Longford were safe. Longford had led by three at the break, - to -, thanks largely to the accuracy from frees of Sean McCormack. Paddy Bradley showed all his class too in the opening phase of the game and was at the heart of anything productive from Derry. McGoldricks first goal levelled the match, finishing coolly, after being set up by Paddy Bradley. His second goal put Derry in the driving seat, despite not playing well. Again McCormack got Longford level and then the home side went in front and on their way to victory.

Thatrsquos not the same as having a formal British Irish Intergovernmental Conference with officials and an agenda, he said.ldquoI have no objectionthey want to talk every day. Thatrsquos a good idea, but I think the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement should be followed and that means there should be a BIIC on a regular and frequent basis. That is what was signed.Speaking weeks after street violence by loyalist protesters erupted in Belfast over issues related to Brexit and the NI Protocol, Mr Ahern said BIIC meetings were very important.ldquoIt does concern me that we havenrsquot had a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference for a long, long time, maybe a few years.Mr Ahern was interviewed by former BBC political correspondent Martina Purdy and former barrister Elaine Kelly, who spoke to the former Taoiseach about peace-building, faith and St Patrick.ldquoThe two governments, the British and Irish governments are the custodians of the Agreement. They are not meeting to discuss these issues. That clearly is not in line with the agreement.ldquoI am not using any other words than what the Agreement usedhellip The agreement says that there must be frequent meetings and you know that should be happening.ldquoThey donrsquot have to be for long. They can be on zoom, Microsoft teams anything you like. They should be having these meetings and where there are dficulties they should be dealing with at those meetings.ldquoIn the absence of those meetings, things can drt. Quite frankly I donrsquot understand why those meetings canrsquot take place.ldquoI donrsquot expect the British Prime Minister and the Taoiseach to have a meeting all day ndash they donrsquot have to do that. They could have a meeting for an hour and half. Thatrsquos not going to kill anybody.He said other officials or ministers or institutions within departmental structures could then follow through with the issues.Mr Ahern also spoke about the future of the Catholic Church in Ireland, where he said there must be more involvement of the laity.He said his faith was important to him. ldquoYou donrsquot want to overplay it because you are attacked nowyou do that.ldquoReligion is important to me. I am a believer and I understand it and I read about it and I think itrsquos part of my le and I often think that a lot of people, who have a lot of problems and dficulties - it is because they donrsquot have it. All I can do is pray for them.During lockdown Mr Ahern shared how he went to mass regularly from his kitchen in Drumcondra, sharing masses online from Clonard monastery in Belfast, as well as Derry, Cork and Dublin.He said lockdown had given people time to reflect and enjoy walking, something he really enjoys.He told the podcasters mdash former Sisters of Adoration who are now pilgrim guides on Saint Patrickrsquos Way Downpatrick mdash that ldquohe would love to come and walk the Irish Camino with them.He revealed he had spent nine months of the lockdown reading The Annals of the Four Masters, chronicles of medieval Irish history.Mr Ahern described it as a ldquotough read, admitting he could only manage  pages a day.Asked what he would like to banish from Ireland, in the Spirit of St Patrick, he said ldquoinjustice and violence..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Breast.jpg","title":"Breastfeeding is the most beautiful thing  ","story":"WHEN Joanne Masseyrsquos second child, Edward, was born six months ago, she knew she wanted to breastfeed him, but also,possible, donate to the milk bank.Weighing in at just over lbs, Edward fed for  minutes soon after he was born and it seemed like establishing feeding would be no problem.However, a few months before Edward was born, Joannersquos family found out her father, Jim Watson, had cancer.She explained: ldquoEventually we would learn it was terminal. So my stress levels were abnormally high.ldquoI soon felt like I couldnrsquot feed Edward enough, stress got the better of me at times and my brilliant health visitor Maura pointed me to a local breastfeeding group and also another brilliant lady, my breastfeeding peer support worker Aine Jordan-Doxey, who just completely gave me the confidence and support to keep going.ldquoThe peer breastfeeding group is hosted by a midwe health visitor and contains a beautul bunch of souls who are just there for each other. Wersquore all in the same boat and through this group I have received many tips, tricks and even friends.Despite Joannersquos determination to breastfeed Edward, it wasnrsquot all plain sailing.ldquoBreastfeeding is just the most beautul thing.Yes it can be dficult and absolutely frustrating at times but the benefits far outweigh those short blips, she said.ldquoThe best advice Irsquove ever heard mdash lsquodonrsquot give up on a bad dayrsquo.On a rough day, breastfeeding Edward gave me comfort, knowing I was the reason he is full and happy made me feel so good.ldquoAine gave me so much advice, including certain foods to eat to boost milk supply. Oats, theyrsquore your best friend! And you cannot drink enough water.Soon Joanne had more milk that Edward could take so she began collecting extra milk for the milk bank.She said: ldquoThe bottles arrived and I filled the first ml on December  last year. The donation was nearly full in a month but sadly my dad passed away on January  at the age of . There was a few weeks with no donations as my milk supply ped to an all-time low. Itrsquos just incredible what stress can do to your body.ldquoWell, Aine was there again, checking in, keeping me in chat, and keeping me motivated to keep breastfeeding. I am very lucky to have a wonderful, supportive husband, a close knit family and a close circle of best friends who have been tremendous during this very dficult time.Joanne went on to complete her donation of four litres of milk she calls ldquoliquid gold on Motherrsquos Day and wants to thank Aine for all her help and support.She said: ldquoI fully support every motherrsquos choice to either breastfeed or bottle-feed butanyone was struggling to breastfeed I would strongly recommend taking the support thatrsquos available.ldquoPersonally I am continuing to breastfeed because it gives me a little comfort in this time of grief, itrsquos a moment where I just look into his eyes and feel so needed and loved. So not only for the instantly available nutrition and comfort to my son but for those moments of joy I get from it too.Aine says she is so proud of Joanne mdash not only for continuing to breastfeed during the emotional time of her fatherrsquos illness and death but also for contributing four litres of milk to the Trustrsquos milk bank.The mother-of-threersquos own experience of breastfeeding had been rewarding but also not without its challenges.While she was living in England at the time, she recalled a time when one of her children was not thriving while she was feeding them.ldquoMy doctor and my health visitor both told me to stop breastfeeding my son and it was so frustrating as I knew that was not the problem so I continued on and it turned out that there was something  wrong.She began supporting Joanne in November last year when Edward was five weeks old.ldquoJoanne was exhausted and had been through some dficult nights where Edward wasnrsquot sleeping and was screaming through the night.I remember speaking with her about developmental leaps and what to expect at this stage and the normal infant sleep patterns, said Aine.ldquoFrom the beginning I could tell Joanne had so much passion for breastfeeding and wanted to succeed in every way. Joanne began expressing enough to give Edward a bottle and soon after he started sleeping better, just in time for her toddler to stop sleeping through. Joanne never let this stop her and carried on with minimal sleep.Aine said that when Joanne first mentioned to her about the possibility of donating milk, there were only  donors on the Northern Ireland milk bank.She said ldquoI was so proud as Joanne was the first of my mums to donate and it honestly made me smile at the thought. As usual Joanne just laughed and said it was no big deal as she enjoyed it. It was the first time I disagreed with her as I thought she was doing an extraordinary thing.ldquoWhen I opened her message and saw Edward surrounded by four litres of expressed milk for the milk bank, I was blown away again. What an incredible gt for the sick babies in theneonatal units.ldquoNot only was Joanne potty training a toddler and breastfeeding on demand, but she was expressing for the milk bank. I am so thankful to have been a part of her journey.

However, he did not make it through to show his impressive main course and dessert to the judges.Both chefs threw their all into devising four courses, including an appetiser and pre-dessert mdash based on the theme celebrating British innovation.Hopes were high for East Down given that Dundrum chef Alex Browne Greene, from EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, got two dishes to the national final last year and narrowly missed out on being crowned champion of champions at the banquet.Gemmarsquos starter was a twist on gammon, egg and chips, inspired by Kegomatic from Queenrsquos University students and for her fish course, the innovation shown in the building of the Titanic inspired her sea bass fish dish.She used William Clannyrsquos invention of the safety lamp for miners for her main course of lamb and the influence of astronomer Alice Everett as the first woman to work for the Royal Observatory to inspire her dessert, Out of this World.The dessert was her favourite course and she was delighted to have been scored a ten by chef Daniel Clford.ldquoIrsquom known for my desserts so I was really delighted to have got that score from Daniel, said Gemma.ldquoI also took his advice on my main course as therersquos no better person to take advice from and generally scaled back my dishes and made them more refined as the comments back were that there was too much on the plate.While Gemma was proud to have made it through to the regional final, she said she was not disappointed at not going through to the national judging.ldquoTo be honest, it was a bit of a relief as I did not know how I was going to go up against all the other chefs in the national final as I have only been cheffing for seven years and am mostly self-taught, she revealed.Gemma went into the competition, which was filmed last November, full of confidence and determined to do her best.ldquoI think I just went into a zone and concentrated on my own dishes and not to get too caught up in what the other chefs were doing, she said.ldquoPhelim was brilliant on the day and deserved to win and I remember saying on the programme that the better chef won. I hope that he goes on to get a dish to the banquet.While she has been receiving fantastic customer feedback from her popup, A Peculiar Tea, which she has been operating during the lockdowns, Gemma admitted that cooking was not her first career choice.ldquoWhen I left school I actually went to Queenrsquos University to do a nursing degree but a medical issue I experienced meant that I couldnrsquot complete it, she said.She then studied Bio Medical Sciences for a while before going to Ulster University to complete a software engineering degree.Her love of food and cooking mdash inspired by her chef mother mdash was strictly a hobby until the age of  when she took her first job at Slims Kitchen on the Lisburn Road in Belfast where she cut her teeth for a year while doing a Culinary Masters course.For four years Gemma continued studying and working full-time at a iety of great establishments, such as the Fitzwilliam Hotel in Belfast where she rose to head pastry chef, before moving The Old Inn, Crawfordsburn, where she worked all the sections and eventually became sous chef.She has been in Alexanders for the last two years and got the opportunity to become an owner last year.ldquoIt may have taken my several attempts before I found the right career but I was determined not to do any job that I did not absolutely love and was passionate about.Like Gemma, Brunels chef Paul Cunningham hopes to be invited back next year after his disappointing showing this year.The  year-old had hoped to get to the regional judging to please his six-year-old daughter, Farrah.ldquoFarrah and I are massive fans of the show, we watch every year and of course, I wanted to further than I did but Irsquove got over the disappointment now and concentrating on getting the restaurant ready for re-opening, Paul told the Recorder.Paul is known for only using local produce from within a -mile radius of Newcastle and foraging for herbs and plants.His menu reflected his locality and passion for pioneers including Belfast-born Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Isambard Kingdom Brunelrsquos refloating of the SS Great Britain in Dundrum Bay mdash an incident which led him to name his restaurant by the great engineer.Paul only got to cook his starter and main course on the show but said his main course and dessert were showstoppers, with the main course of lamb called Healthy Heart made without using any salt or butter, inspired by Frank Pantridge who invited the portable defibrillator.He also collaborated with Doran Precision Engineering to create a model of the Titanic for one of his dishes and a special dish to show off his dessert, the Atom Smasher, inspired by Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Condemnation.jpg","title":"Condemnation over Murlough vandalism  ","story":"LOCAL politicians have criticised vandals responsible for setting fire to a gate at the Murlough Nature Reserve two weekends ago as  firefighters were battling a huge blaze in the nearby Mournes.The vandals also left behind a trail of rubbish at the internationally acclaimed area with their actions condemned by South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Mournes councillor Laura Devlin.They say it ldquobeggars belief that while the raging wildfire destroyed  acres of rich habitat across the Mournes, there were people who thought that it was appropriate to start a fire at the Nature Reserve.The politicians also revealed that National Trust staff had to remove  bags of rubbish from the Reserve location on the Sunday the fire in the Mournes was eventually extinguished.Cllr Devlin said as young people drank alcohol and watched the blaze raging across the mountains, they set fire to a pedestrian gate which is also used to prevent Exmore ponies at the Reserve from escaping.ldquoI am really shocked at this behaviour, she said. ldquoBy the Saturday evening, everyone in the locality had an idea of the widespread damage in the Mournes but these iniduals thought it appropriate to cause more damage and potentially risk another blaze.ldquoI have no idea who these iniduals were and how old they are so I am appealing to people young and old.

He had a rare gt for making everyone feel better about themselves and for knowing they always had a friend in him. Facebook notices of his death drew an unprecedented outpouring of tributes and comments from across the region and demonstrated the levels of affection in which Jim was held.As a footballer he had few peers. His time with Downpatrick Rec was marked with cup and league successes, culminating in lting the Steel and Sons Cup in front of record attendances at the Crusaders Seaview ground for the first drawn match and the subsequent replay.Supporters from Downpatrick travelled in their thousands, marking the event one of the most widely celebrated sporting achievements of that era. The gate receipts were the highest ever recorded for the annual showpiece of amateur soccer in Northern Ireland, so much so that for the first time the income exceeded the VAT threshold, which meant tax had to be paid.On the day the Rec won that Steel Cup replay, Distillery tried to sign Jim as he left the pitch. He turned them down with a typically firm but gentlemanly refusal and stayed with the Rec for another four years, helping them to add to their cabinet of silverware.Jim lsquoCootrsquo Connolly was a player of exceptional talent. A classy and cultured defender, he is remembered for his unique ability to rise above other players, most of whom had a distinct height advantage, but lacked Jimrsquos trademark for timing his runs and hanging in the air for longer than ought to have been humanly possible. Many a spectator were left speechless after matches, shaking their heads in puzzlement at his exploits. Yes, he was that good.Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran, who was the Downpatrick Rec goalkeeper, said it was ldquosometimes scary playing behind Jim. ldquoWhen I walked with Coot or talked with him or more often had a beer with him, I felt I was in the presence of greatness.So much so that everyone wanted a part of that, and his we Angie and family had to learn to share Coot because he just made you feel good about yourself. For that we as a community are eternally grateful to them. His footballing ability was absolutely extraordinary. I played behind him and said to him on a few occasions lsquoCoot you scare me. The things you do defy the laws of physics and gravityrsquo. He would jump for a ball start to come down and without touching the ground go up again. I swear it.Tony added: ldquoThe world is a sadder place for his leaving but somewhere up there hersquoll be playing with the guys that have gone before him and maybe BFwill be managing. I hope they will keep me a place on their team.Former Rec manager Jim Prior was devastated to learn of Jimrsquos death. ldquoLike all his former teammates I am cut to ribbons that Jim is no longer with us. As a footballer, he was simply out of this world. The other players on our most successful team were in awe of Jim and all loved him. He had star quality written all over him.He could do things that others couldnrsquot do, whether that was on the training ground or in the toughest of matches. I canrsquot remember him putting in less than a five-star performance.The Recrsquos former club secretary, Patricia Murrayremembers Jim as the baby of the Steel Cup team. ldquoMy deepest and heartfelt sympathies to Angela and all his family and friends. His laugh, smile and craic will be truly missed, Patricia said.Jim Connollyrsquos impact with Downpatrick was repeated at his next clubs, Ards and Killyleagh YC, where he suffered a career ending injury. He had been with the club for just two seasons but left an indelible mark. One of Killyleaghrsquos stalwart players, Philip Jennings, posted his own tribute. ldquoGreat memories of watching Jim for the great Down Rec team and playing with him at Ards and Killyleagh. A real legend in local football, but even more than that, just an absolute gentleman.Despite his injury, Jim ed to football several years later to turn out for the Downshire Hospital, with whom he won an all-Ireland medal winner in  under the management of Brian Cheetham.But the question always remained about what could have become of this precocious talent had he been able to stick with one of English footballrsquos premier clubs.His trials there were cut short by homesickness, more particularly an abiding love for his recently widowed mother. Downpatrick was his anchor. Family, friends, and the Stream Street precinct of his youth were too deeply ingrained for the young Connolly to ever contemplate leaving them behind. It was never a regret for Jim. Indeed,anything, the choice to stay reinforced his passion and love for the area. He perhaps never knew how deeply those feelings of connection were ed by those who had the good fortune to know him.Jimrsquos trials were at Nottingham Forest, Newcastle, and Everton, all three organised by local scout Bill Oakes. Everton came closest to getting his signature after pursuing him back to Downpatrick, although it was later learned that Newcastle too badly wanted to bring him on board.Local sports writer Charlie McStay recalled being contacted in later years by one of the Newcastle coaches who was enquiring about what had happened to Jim. ldquoNewcastle knew they had a gem on their hands, but he slipped through the net.All the coaches rated him at the highest level and believed he would have gone on to become a true star of English football, said Charlie.What a journey that would have been. All the way from Dunleath City and Santos in the Downpatrick Youth League to the pinnacle of professional soccer.Although soccer was Jimrsquos first love, he was an accomplished boxer and in his early days was trained by Owen Kerr, a respected coach who was a friend of world heavyweight champion, Floyd Patterson. Coincidentally, Owen was uncle to Cathal Kerr, who married Jimrsquos sister Bronagh. Small world!Jim also played juvenile and senior football for the Downpatrick Russell Gaelic Union, which this week remembered him as ldquomore than just a great footballer.An online RGU statement said: ldquoHe was one of the nicest guys you could ever meet. A true gentleman with an infectious laugh, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him.Away from sport, Jim trained as a mechanic and later became a minibus driver at Knockevin School and the local hospitals. He then joined Ulsterbus as a driver at the Downpatrick depot and rounded off his career as a groundsman at the Delamont estate. Always active, alwaysbusy that was the Jim Connolly way.Throughout his le, Jimrsquos singular passion was his family and friends. He was devoted to his we Angela mdash the couple were together from their teenage days and were rarely seen apart mdash and to his children, Aurla, Blaine and Clare. Nothing brought him greater happiness also than the birth of his grandchildren, Ruby, Darcy, Fianna, Fiachra, Grace and Eve. He is also survived by brothers Pat and Martin, sisters Ann, Marie, Bronagh, and Eilish, by his father-in-law Paddy Teggart, and by sons-in-law Feargal and Jude and his daughter-in-law Megan.Theirs is not a private grief. It is shared by countless hundreds who remember the boy and man who gave so much pleasure and for whom there is always a place in their hearts.Joe McCoubrey.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Job.jpg","title":"JobStart scheme to help young people welcomed by MLA  ","story":"THE launch of a new government scheme designed to create job opportunities for young people has been welcomed by local politicians.Department for Communities minister Deirdre Hargey last week launched the poundm JobStart scheme designed to support - year olds facing additional employment challenges due to the impact of Covid-.In addition, the government department has also helped create additional employment opportunities for young people and remove barriers for those seeking employment through the work experience programme and an expanded adviser discretionary fund.Minister Hargey said the Covid- pandemic has had an ldquounprecedented impact on the local economy and labour market and that as part of her departmentrsquos response, it has addressed the anticipated impacts on young people and those who are ready to be re-employed but need help negotiating the process of finding work.ldquoThis has included creating job opportunities and placements for young people providing additional payments towards travel or childcare expenses financial support of up to pound, a year to assist in the removal of barriers to employment and training to help people increase their chances of gaining employment.The JobStart scheme is designed to create opportunities for - year olds by providing positions with employers for a period of six months, increasing to nine months for those who meet additional criteria.An Opportunity Guarantee strand has been added to The Work Experience Programmefeaturing  week placements with the guarantee of an interview for a job or an apprenticeship on completion.Strangford MLA Kellie Armstrong and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have both welcomed the new scheme.Mrs Armstrong said the scheme was originally due to start last year, arguing that many young people may have missed out as a result of its delayed implementation.She continued: ldquoThe roll-out of this scheme is welcome as it will help young people climb back from the pandemic financially, while giving the economy a boost. I encourage them to apply for it.ldquoHowever, it is frustrating it has taken us so long to get to this stage. The rest of the UK benefited from it [the scheme] while Northern Ireland lagged behind which was unacceptable. Something which would be so useful can only lose value as time moves on.The MLA said that during the height of lockdown, people under  were the most impacted in terms of job losses and went from ldquoexpecting a scheme to wonderingone would appear at all, confirming that she has asked for confirmation that the Department for Communities will ensure opportunities from the JobStart scheme will be made available across Northern Ireland and will not just be concentrated around Belfast.Cllr Curran said with lockdown restrictions continuing to ease, any move to create job opportunities for young people is particularly welcome as they have a key role to play in future economic success.ldquoMany young people have bore the brunt of an unparalleled economic situation which has had a massive impact on the provincersquos economy, he continued.ldquoRebuilding the economy will require access to highly skilled and talented young iniduals to enable employers to compete globally and young people, in particular, need to be able to avail of high quality routes into careers.Cllr Curran also highlighted the importance of apprenticeship schemes to assist with economic recovery, and, looking forward, believes it is vital that the Newry, Mourne and Down area has access to highly skilled employers as businesses work to recover from the devastating impact of coronavirus.He said he firmly believes that the enterprise, innovation and entrepreneurship of young people is crucial to the economy..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5May2021-Athletics.jpg","title":"Lady luck for East Down AC runners  ","story":"THE  Belfast Half Marathon was always going to be a virtual affair due to Covid- restrictions, but that didnrsquot seem to put people off entering and setting their own route in order to chase a personal best for the distance or simply to claim their T-shirt.This event is normally well attended and attracts a raft of spectators, which creates a great atmosphere, but this year it was up to the runners to come up with a way of motivating themselves on the day.East Down AC had several runners who have used this as their incentive to keep churning out the long runs and as the date approached they were well prepared to cover the . miles.It was a case of girl power as all the EDAC athletes who took part were female on this occasion. Joanne Carson is credited with coming up with a pleasing route for her buddies, Helen Vint, Mags Flynn and Cathy Burke.These girls are to be seen most weekends, rain, hail or shine, chalking up miles in and around Downpatrick. Their dedication is most commendable. In their opinion, a half marathon is long enough to challenge the legs but not as draining as a full marathon so you could almost say that it is an enjoyable task.Joanne got them off to a familiar start. They met outside Castlewellan Forest Park on Saturday morning and ran into the park to do three laps of the lake. Nicely warmed up, they then headed out the main road to Newcastle and didnrsquot stop till they were in the grounds of the Slieve Donard hotel.They fairly breezed along and were all within sight of each other as they came to a halt. Cathy andMags were at the head of the pack in one hour  minutes with Helen less than a minute behind.Joanne was just a few seconds over the two hours and more than happy with her run and they all agreed that it was a scenic route.Being at the Percy French and the fact that outside hospitality had conveniently opened the night before, it would have been rude not to have an ice cold beverage to celebrate. Well deserved ladies.And so to Sunday, Suzy Smith often meets with friends and family including Kelly her niece for a long Sunday run.They stay close to home in Ballykinlar where the terrain could be described as lumpy. In fact whichever way they go, there are some challenging hills but these girls are well used to it and tough enough to persevere.Suzy had actually only planned to run a few miles with brother Patrick to encourage him on his way to the half marathon distance but she was enjoying it so much that she ran on and on until before she knew it, she had covered the entire . miles.Despite this only being her second time to complete a half marathon, she finished in a very respectable time of two hours and five minutes.Who knows how well she could doshe was participating in an official race Kelly meanwhile had struck a brisk pace from the off and followed her own rhythm easing ahead in the early stages. She has been running very well in training and it was no surprise that despite the gradients involved, she ended up with a personal best time of one hour  minutes.Again there is no doubt on a flatter course with other runners to chase, there will be improvement to come but for now both Smiths were content with their efforts and so they should be, well done..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/7May2021-Leader.jpg","title":"Leader and inspiration  ","story":"FINNEBROGUE Artisan has promised to continue the legacy of founding chairman Denis Lynn who died in a quad bike accident at the weekend.Hailed as an ldquoinnovator and visionary, Mr Lynn died following a tragic incident at his home in Killyleagh on Sunday.Mr Lynnbecame synonymous with his Downpatrick-based firm, which now employs , people over four local sites.On buying Finnebrogue Estate on the outskirts of the town in , the former potato chip seller turned to beef and deer farming and established Finnebrogue as the biggest venison processor and supplier in the UK.He then produced quality sausages, supplying Marks and Spencer and other leading retailers, and developed the nitrate-free bacon brand, Naked Bacon, in .More recently, Finnebrogue has ersied into developing meat-free products.The firmrsquos senior management team will now lead the business with non-executive director David Manning stepping up as interim-chairman and non-executive director Colin Walsh as interim deputy-chairman.A company statement paid tribute to Mr Lynn, who is survived by his we Christine, daughters Kerry, Clare, Tara and Ciara, and his wider family circle.It said: ldquoDenis was an innovator and a visionary with an infectious passion for delivering positive change for the planet and its people.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorScotland though is a dferent matter.This Ulster-Scot independent spirit has a long pedigree. The Ulster Plantations in the s were the success that they were thanks to Presbyterian Scots. That they were treated as second class citizens by the Anglo British establishment was a grudge they took to America in the s and is why they were prominent in the American Revolution against Britain resulting in the  Declaration of Independence.Recent events have increased NI unionist anger at London. If, hypothetically, they migrated en masse to Scotland, might these Ulster-Scots vote the independence campaign indisputably across the line in a modern day Scottish version of the American Revolution thus banishing a deceitful London from their lives forever  If yes it might suit everyone. What are now NI unionists would find themselves under an Edinburgh government they’d have more affinity with than they ever would under a London or Dublin one the Scots would be happy with independence the Irish would be happy to be ‘a nation once again’ and the English would be happy no longer subsidising troublesome regions.Problem solved – apart from finding Scottish housing and employment for a million NI unionists!Thomas Stewart, Belfast BT——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityVale of Glamorgan council put forward Aberthaw, a recently closed coal-fired power plant, as a potential site for a fusion prototype.The UK government last year called for suggestions for possible sites to pioneer the technology which could generate electricity with low carbon emissions.But opposition councillors on the Vale council have claimed the cabinet has ldquorushed through its decision to suggest Aberthaw as a site.More NewsCardf Tomasz Waga murder investigation sees two more arrestedFour coffee shops in Penarth for meeting a friend outdoorsThings to do in South Wales on May Bank Holiday weekend Plaid Councillor Ian Johnson said: ldquoIt was strange that the council leadership did not consult with other parties or ask a cross-party scrutiny committee to consider issues before making the expression of interest about a possible future use of the Aberthaw plant.ldquoEven though it is an early point, many people will have questions about the technology, the impact of the development and the process, and discussing this in scrutiny would open up the debate and ensure transparency.Fusion technology is still in its infancy and no fusion reactor has ever created more power than it consumes. But scientists say it could be cleaner and safer than fission, the nuclear technology currently used to generate electricity.If Aberthaw is chosen, the council is hoping the power plant could bring lots of high-tech high-paid jobs to the region. Westminster should decide on a site by the end of next year, and the power plant would be built by , costing about pound billion.But the Valersquos cabinet used controversial emergency powers last month to put forward Aberthaw as a site, without consulting the full council or any scrutiny committees. Council leader Neil Moore said this was due to the deadline for suggestions at the end of last month.     However, Westminster made the initial call for suggestions in December last year, meaning the council had four months in total to debate and scrutinise the decision to put forward Aberthaw. The council debated the issue in a meeting this week, after the deadline passed.Conservative Cllr Gordon Kemp said: ldquoThis is being dealt effectively without allowing any proper consideration or scrutiny. Itrsquos an extremely signicant matter, evenwe ignore the issue of public concern over such a proposal.ldquoWersquore looking at potentially a colossal, massive investment in the Vale. It could create many jobs, so I think itrsquos something that should have been discussed.ldquoI appreciate there are always deadlines on this. But Irsquom very concerned and surprised this wasnrsquot put before cabinet and scrutiny committees [earlier].Cllr Moore said the issue was ldquonot a debate, but promised to meet with the leaders of the opposition parties on the council, and to give a cross-party scrutiny committee a chance to consider the plans.He said: ldquoThis is just for noting. We used the emergency procedure because it had to be in by a deadline. This is not a debate about what we can do.ldquoBut Irsquom more than happy to have a meeting with the group leaders, and Irsquom more than happy to ask for an information report to go to the environment and regeneration scrutiny committee. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

During my  years as a community campaigner I have passionately campaigned for education, creating more opportunities for young people, tackling the housing crisis and the climate crisis. I was the regeneration officer for the Loudoun Square and Trowbridge redevelopment, and was selected as the Wales delegate for the International Association for Community Development and Commonwealth Games in Glasgow . Over the last  years Irsquove supported young people in Cardf South and Penarth to develop their skills in the arts and creative industries and to participate in a wide range of opportunities. I successfully gained the London  Olympic Cultural Inspire Mark for Butetown Community. I entered politics because of the increasing injustice around me - increasing food banks, homelessness, education, climate crisis, lack of opportunity for our youth, lack of affordable housing I was sick and tired of our communities being treated like second class citizens by the London elite. I want a fair deal for our communities for Cardf South and Penarth and for Wales.Alan Golding - Freedom Alliance. No Lockdown. No CurfewsRaised in Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taff, I have since lived in Brighton and Glasgow, moving to Cardf in . Since my early twenties Irsquove been interested in the workings of society and how we treat each other, animals and our planethellip and in the process Irsquove come to completely mistrust virtually all career politicians. I believe a new way of doing politics is needed in Wales with a new set of values across the whole system. I donrsquot believe the current political structure and its controllers have the interest of the people at its heart with regard to their mental and physical health, their quality of le and spiritual and economic well-being.     Paul Campbell - UKIPHello Im Paul Campbell and Im standing in the Cardf South and South Wales Central area for UKIP in the Senedd elections on MAY TH.Being. Born in Cardf and lived most of my le there I appreciate the Greatv Potential the pride and the Welsh Identity in Cardf and the Valleys towns. and I have seen how things have changed over the years with parts of the area unrecognizable from the place I remember.Areas of Cardf have become run down and standards have fallen with a loss of community spirit The surrounding Towns have been neglected with. A lack of investment and job creation initiatives.Mass immigration in the UK has put tremendous strains on cities like Cardf Newport and Swansea with wage depression and overstretched public services.. The Conservatives claim to be in control of immigration but they will only ever talk about it and under there watch in the in the last  years  million more people have come to our shires thats  cities the sthe size of Cardf . Increasingly they are choosing to come to Wales as Labour has encouraged them by a making Wales a Nation Of sanctuary.Helen Westhead - Green PartyOur current administration has ignored the climate emergency and has left so many people vulnerable and excluded. As we recover from the pandemic we have unique opportunity to create better ways of working - the influence of an elected Green in the room will be transformative.We see from across the UK, Europe, and beyond the incredible dference Greens make, holding government to account, speaking out against inequality, and representing real people and their communities, not political or corporate interest. Wales is long overdue that representation in the Senedd.We know that the way we recover from this pandemic and build back stronger is through investing in communities and public services, ensuring everyone has access to local facilities, and supporting small business. If elected, one of my main priorities would be better walking and cycling routes, connected to affordable public transport and green outdoor spaces that communities can enjoy. Advocating for a Universal Basic Income would ensure no one is left behind in our bold plan to transform Wales.With the more proportional voting system on the regional ballot in Wales, Labour cannot win regional seats. A Green vote on your second ballot is the only progressive option.Matt Friend - PropelPropel has led the campaigns on two of the most important issues affecting Barry, Penarth and Cardf.Wersquore the only party that has committed not to allow any nuclear mud to be dumped in our waters, including the mud dredged from outside Hinkley nuclear reactor in Somerset.And wersquore the only party that even mentions the scandal of dangerous fire risk cladding on so many of our flats and buildings. Through our Contract with Wales we have committed not to issue new building contracts to any housing developer involved in the scandal, until they have paid to fix the problem they created.Wersquoll also end the way leaseholders are getting rinsed by introducing a service charge cap, linked to the Retail Price Index. That will stop the double digit increases in service charges that leaseholders have had to put up with.Most importantly, wersquoll introduce a Coronavirus Recovery Act to end Welsh lockdowns, save lives and restore freedoms. We canrsquot just hope wersquoll get our freedoms back, we have to vote for them.The ten laws in our Contract with Wales will transform our nation. Wales needs champions. Vote Propel.Alex Wilson, Liberal DemocratsI live with my family in Penarth and I became involved in politics because of the widening isions that seemed to occurring our community. I feel that with the Liberal Democrat core values of tolerance and understanding we can bring people back together. We can cut through the shouting of partisan politics and once again listen to what people want in their community.The next five years is going to be critical and I feel the Senedd must put recovery first. That means recovering from the Covid pandemic, the recovery of our economy, better healthcare services and a happier community which can be achieved by better transport links, saving our environment and ato community values.Irsquove been around long enough to know a political status-quo without a strong opposition can breed complacency. Wersquove seen this in national and local government. If I am elected I will ensure that the voice of the people is heard. If yoursquove ever wondered how we almost lost the Kymin or how they plan to build over  homes on contaminated land at Cosmeston Farm in Sully, well itrsquos because our current political leaders often lack empathy with local communities.Other candidates standing are:Vaughan Gething - LabourAngus Hawkins - Gwlad The Welsh Independence PartyLisa Peregrine ndash Abolish the Welsh Assembly Party Alan Pick ndash Reform UKDavid Rolfe ndash IndependentLeighton Rowlands ndash Conservative article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Otherwise a coalition must be attempted.:Who can vote Anyone over the age of  can vote in the Senedd election provided they are:- registered to do so- living in Wales- not legally excluded from votingThis is the first time  and -year-olds have been eligible to vote. What impact that has on the result remains to be seen.How do I vote There are three ways - in person, by post and by proxy - however, the deadlines for latter two options have already passed.Voting at the polling booth with take place until pm today.Polling stations will be kitted out with hand sanitiser and distancing markers to help voters remain safe from coronavirus.Most crucially, voters are being asked to bring their own pen or pencil.Face coverings must also be worn, unless exempt.How does the voting system work Each voter will have two votes - one constituency vote and one regional vote.Youll be represented in the Senedd by five Members. One for your constituency and four for the region of Wales where you live.Constituency vote - this is for the person you want to represent you and your local area. Wales has  constituencies, with each being represented by one MS in the Senedd. Constituency votes are counted in a first past the post system - so the candidate with the most votes is elected.     Regional vote - This is for who you want to represent your region of Wales - South Wales East, South Wales Central, South Wales West Mid and West Wales and North Wales. There are  regional Senedd Members, elected by the additional member system.When will results be announced As with a lot of things this past year, the election has been hit by Covid restrictions.While voting will happen today, counting will not take place the same night as is usually the case on election night.Instead, the votes will be taken to the counting locations and kept secure until morning.They will then be veried - spoiled ballots removed - and counted.Due to Covid restrictions, this will likely take longer than in normal counts, but results are expected within two days of polls closing.Keep an eye on the Argus website for the latest, and results. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
