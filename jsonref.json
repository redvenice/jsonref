Above she is pictured during the 2015 White House Christmas Party          She made copious notes on the details of her personal life while traveling to more than 60 countries over five years on Air Force One, and witnessing Obama\u0027s life in midair. Above the president is pictured on the aircraft in 2009 Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House staffer. She worked out on a treadmill next to the president, who often \u0027trash-talked\u0027 her, goaded her to run faster, and taught her to be optimistic. Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met Michelle and how she tried to pass him off to one of her friends.Around the world, she watched a crew of smokers douse themselves in Purell sanitizer up past their wrists after grabbing a smoke so there was no lingering smell of cigarettes for Obama who had quit the habit. \u0027No one deserves to be this lucky\u0027, the author writes about this core group of staffers who flew around the world on Air Force One together.Beck knew she wasn\u0027t a good fit for a job at a Washington think tank, PR firm, or nonprofit after her semester-long tutoring job at Sidwell Friends School - \u0027the Harvard of Washington\u0027s private schools\u0027 - ended in 2011.          Beck Dorey-Stein discusses her professional and private affairs while working as Obama\u0027s stenographer in From the Corner of the Oval The selective Quaker school in Washington has educated a lengthy roster of notable alumni from Teddy Roosevelt\u0027s son, Richard Nixon\u0027s daughter,  Al Gore\u0027s son, Chelsea Clinton, and the Obama girls, Malia and Sasha, as well as the children of members of Congress.Beck intended to only live in D.C. for the duration of the job – three months...\u0027because who wants to live in DC? – A one trick political pony town,\u0027 she writes. \u0027My job in the spring of 2011 was to help those hormonally-charged stressballs chill the f**k out\u0027, Beck writes while casting an eye to what looked like \u0027human Ken dolls in a short-sleeved button-down\u0027.Sitting across from one of them at the school one day flirting and thinking he was a teacher, the man told her he was working although he did not seem to be doing anything.He was a Secret Service agent watching Malia.In her new job assignment, Beck was advised by the hiring agency to stay away from the Secret Service agents as well as \u0027stay with your boyfriend\u0027.    She knew this was going to be her big break and felt confident leaving her boyfriend, Sam, back in Washington working for a PR firm writing speeches for gubernatorial candidates.He always encouraged her and supported her taking the job that would separate them.But Beck broke protocol of the job when she got involved in a hot and heavy secret sexual relationship with one of Obama\u0027s senior staffers in hotel rooms - and fell in love. Left with a broken heart and feeling duplicitous with too many nights at a bar getting drunk, she says the stolen thrill was worth the heartache although it cost her the relationship with her boyfriend in D.C.    Boarding Air Force One for the first time with an overstuffed duffel because she didn\u0027t know what not to pack, she thought she saw actor Jim Carrey sitting near the front of the plane.He turned out to be the man she fell hopelessly in love with, Jason Wolf - the man she left her hotel room door ajar for in foreign cities.Air Force One - where pool reporters had their own press cabin - has everything one could ask for in comfort – endless entrees, snacks, cocktails – except while on the luxury airliner, everyone paid for food and drinks.Rushing to unpack the first time in search of her steno gear and dumping out her computer bags on the seat next to her, out fell what looked like a vibrator – while one of Obama\u0027s traveling aides was standing there.          Beck\u0027s job was to record everything the president (pictured in 2008)  said, type it up, and release the transcript to the press office and presidential archive          Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House stafferRed-faced, he hurried away.It was only a little travel-sized hot pink silk bag that resembled a vibrator – she wanted to tell him but didn\u0027t.Obama\u0027s traveling staff was almost all women and dubbed \u0027the Vagiants\u0027.This wasn\u0027t the case when he first took office in 2009 when there were few female senior staffers. Now it was the choice of the women to give themselves that name.\u0027Prudish? I would especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs\u0027, she writes.Beck was one of three stenographers rotating on the travel schedule.On international trips, media chipped in and chartered a private plane dubbed the \u0027party plane.\u0027Neither POTUS or senior White House staff traveled on it and the president stayed at a different hotel.The press charter arrived a day ahead of POTUS and Air Force One so TV networks could set up their live shots.On her first trip out, Beck found herself in $500-a night hotel rooms with breathtaking views of Cabo San Lucas before continuing on to Costa Rica, Tanzania, Laos. She\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, international incidents they\u0027ve witnessed – from George H.W. puking on the prime minister of Japan, Reagan in Rome falling asleep in front of the pope, Monica Lewinsky, 911, and Katrina.\u0027Pinch me because how is this scene my real life\u0027? Beck writes.Her first overseas trips on Air Force One took her to Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia where Obama requested an unscheduled stop at the Shwedagon Pagoda, the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world.          Beck admits she had a fling with a White House staffer Jason Wolf, who broke her heart           She recalls how the everyone in the press cabin took their drug of choice and how she\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, and international incidents they\u0027ve witnessedLooking out of the plane\u0027s window while flying into Myanmar, Obama saw the glare of the 451 diamonds encrusting the top of the Buddha and requested a stop.Traveling on to Cambodia, Beck walked out with the press and left recording equipment attached in the room where the president had met with the Japanese prime minister.This could have been interpreted as a spy tactic with a recorder still running. But any disaster was avoided by Wolf, who quickly removed the equipment.  Wolf never talked about his serious relationship with his girlfriend Brooke back home in LA whose father was a famous producer.Beck would leave her hotel room door open for him so he could sneak in at night.   They carried on across the globe while Beck tried to keep her boyfriend Sam out of her mind.She describes experiencing \u0027the best sleepover party ever\u0027 where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any \u0027awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\u0027 she writes. Heading for Delhi in India where the president met the prime minister, Beck was warned about the destitution, the starving children in the streets, begging mothers, sick and thin dogs lying around waiting for death and piles of trash everywhere.But no one on this trip saw any of that.          Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met First Lady MichelleThey were always protected from seeing the poverty in these countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets.\u0027We do not see the slums or hear the screams. No matter where we are in the world, Dar es Salaam or Indianapolis, the field always looks the same: red carpet, white tent, blue velvet drape\u0027.Through a ten-day swing through Africa – Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania where they were advised not to drink the water, the physical risks didn\u0027t compare to the emotional ones, according to the author.\u0027Nothing is scary when the Secret Service is around you\u0027, Beck writes, but she became ill in South Africa after ingesting water on a lettuce leaf. In Jamaica, Obama visited the one-time home of reggae master Bob Marley and sang Marley\u0027s hit, \u0027Three Little Birds in his bedroom – and then on to Panama.The crew traveled with him for the First Family Christmas vacation in Hawaii and for his summer vacation on Martha\u0027s Vineyard.Obama left the Vineyard to deal with ISIS on the rise in the Middle East, Putin revving his power in Eastern Europe and the outbreak of Ebola in Africa – before returning to the Vineyard when the news broke that ISIS had beheaded photojournalist Jim Foley.POTUS made his televised statement the following morning after allowing the family to grieve.\u0027No one in that room can deny the power and sincerity of the president\u0027s address. But even more remarkable than the president\u0027s palpable anger – the sound that follows his words: unprecedented silence\u0027.          While traveling, they were always protected from seeing the poverty in third-world countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets The press were allowed no questions.\u0027And then the president goes golfing\u0027, Beck writes.Negative news stories condemned Obama\u0027s decision to play golf in the wake of such a tragedy but \u0027that exercise is how POTUS copes with stress and grief\u0027, the author writes.\u0027Golf doesn\u0027t provide the president an escape it allows him the only breathing room he\u0027s afforded\u0027.He can\u0027t just go for a walk and hasn\u0027t run outside since 2007.\u0027His influence circles the globe, but his physical freedom is limited to eighteen holes\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s lonely at the top\u0027.CNN pays homage to Bourdain with tribute show that includes...Dennis Rodman CRIES live on CNN as he reveals how Obama...Share this articleWith the end of Obama\u0027s term in sight, Beck wanted to be outside the HRC bubble and away from what felt like power players in Washington hungry to prove something.It was hard for her to imagine not traveling together with this crew of colleagues she had circled the globe with in Air Force One.She remembered the words of Von, the White House butler on her first day who had told her: \u0027It\u0027s just a job.\u0027 \u0027We are nothing special, just lucky,\u0027 she writes.  It was a privilege, an honor, and a job.Her affair with Jason was over and he went back to LA and married his girlfriend.Sam, her old boyfriend, was long gone and back in the arms of his first girlfriend.The author stayed on with the Trump administration –  or what she describes as the \u0027insane clown posse\u0027 – and the White House executive parking lot now filled with Porsches and Maseratis\u0027s instead of Priuses and Chevys.What was once joy has become \u0027a waking nightmare. I\u0027m now a stenographer in the Trump administration\u0027.From the Corner of the Oval will be released on July 10, 2018 and is available for pre-order on Amazon.   From the Corner of the Oval: A Memoir: Beck Dorey-Stein: 9780525509127: Amazon.com: Books"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/13/13/4D2AA8E300000578-5837027-image-a-29_1528894461773.jpg","title":"Studio portraits African Americans 1940s 1950s display Met","story":"    The Metropolitan Museum of Art will exhibit more than 150 studio portraits of African Americans from the 1940s and \u002750s, starting on June 26 through October 8          Though many of the subjects and photographers are unidentified, each portrait tells a story through the clothes and body language, such as this couple in a loving embrace, photographed in 1943          The collection of portraits offers a rare glimpse into what life was like for African Americans during World War II and beyond Though most of the subjects in the portraits are unidentified, they tell their own stories through their affectionate embraces, military uniforms and graduation caps and gowns. Of the photographers and studios themselves, little is known. Mr Rosenheim says many of the portraits were sourced from the South in particular, but little else is known about them.Many studios at the time were small and didn\u0027t last long, but at least one studio, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee was more established and has been identified in a number of the portraits by a small plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits.The full horror of fighting in the trenches revealed:...Early landscape painting by Vincent Van Gogh of women...Share this articleDuring wartime, photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, but particularly during World War II, American culture was shifting \u0027seismically\u0027, Mr Rosenheim says.   The Great Depression had ended and more money was in circulation, so people could treat themselves to portraits – which they hadn\u0027t been able to as much before – and the middle class grew. It also helps that the process of taking portraits was less easier and less expensive than it had been before, according to The Met.\u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes,\u0027 a statement says.          Though little is known about many of the studios, at least one, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee has been identified in a number of portraits by a small  plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits like this portrait from 1942          It was during wartime that photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, as the middle class grew and the culture was shifting          The Met press release says: \u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes\u0027Mr Rosenheim says: \u0027I started seeing these pictures and I realized they had poignancy and were entrancing and simple and many soldiers and sailors and airmen and women posing in their uniforms… and the way they look at the camera and the way their sisters and children and mothers look at the camera and the way friends pose with each other and look at the camera, is just particularly special. \u0027Because it was a time of great change in the US and it was on the cusp of the Civil Rights era. It was the beginning of the second great migration from the South. And it was also a time of introspection.\u0027He adds: \u0027The show is kind of inspired by Frederick Douglass, who argued, at the time of slavery, that even after slavery ended, which he hoped would be soon, that he did not think African Americans would be fully free until they could imagine themselves and project themselves using photography as an act of self-expression. And to replace the negative images of African Americans with positive ones. And that\u0027s what I see in these pictures as an inspiration.\u0027          \u0027The poignancy of these small photographs lies in the essential respect the camera offers its subjects, who sit for their portraits as an act of self-expression,\u0027 the release says          Though some of the backdrops were plain, many portraits were taken in front of elaborate painted backgrounds of forests, lakes and flowers, like this one          This portrait from 1945 shows a woman posing in front of a painted backdrop of a lake, with mountains and flowers  Though few of the subjects have been identified beyond a possible first name or personal note written on the back, Mr Rosenheim hopes that the opening of the exhibit will help curators be able to identify as many of the subjects and portrait studios as they can.\u0027I’m hoping that… people coming to see the show will recognize family members or distant friends or say, doesn’t this look like so and so? Haven’t I seen this face before? I really hope that people will contact us,\u0027 he says.\u0027Mathematically, the youngest people that went to fight in World War II are dying or have just recently died… People who lived a long time. These are people who lived until their 80s or 90s. And so we’re on the cusp of no one knowing who these people are. It’s a really interesting moment.\u0027 The exhibit, with more than 150 studio portraits, will open at The Met Fifth Avenue on June 26 and will be open until October 8.\u0027African American Portraits: Photographs from the 1940s and 1950s\u0027 is organized by Mr Rosenheim and was put on with the help of the Alfred Stieglitz Society.

In 1998, Kark returned to Australia and worked for Ten News in Brisbane.Two years later he moved to the Nine Network and started out as a reporter and back-up presenter for National Nine News. After covering the Warragamba bushfires, he was given a role to Nine’s Sydney newsroom.Stefanovic went on to replace Today host Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents the show to this day. Karl has also filled in on A Current Affair and participated on Torvill and Dean’s Dancing on Ice. He also worked on Carols by Candlelight and is a reporter on 60 Minutes.He met Cassandra Thorburn in 1995 and they later married, having three children together before separating after 21 years. Their orce was finalised in October 2017.          Stefanovic went on to replace Steve Liebmann in 2005 and still presents Today to this dayKarl Stefanovic and Jasmine YarbroughAfter meeting on a Sydney Harbour boat cruise in December 2016, Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough were seen kissing the following February and their romance was confirmed. A year later, the pair were engaged despite claiming to take things slowly.\u0027We are taking things really, really slowly. I certainly did not expect to meet someone five months after I broke up with my wife. That was not planned. I met her on a boat in Sydney. We have a really lovely relationship, but it\u0027s got to be slow for a variety of reasons,\u0027 Karl said.They made their first appearance at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week and spent time together in Bora Bora and Mexico, where Karl met Jasmine’s parents for the first time. However, many slammed Karl’s quick move from Cassandra to Jasmine, including former KIIS FM radio host Meshel Laurie.The radio host blasted their displays of affection as ‘insensitive’ and ‘shameless’. \u0027It feels a little insensitive, obviously I don\u0027t know these people. Is it criminal? No. Is it illegal? No, is it a bit bloody shameless and rotten? Maybe.’           Cassandra Thorburn and Karl Stefanovic attend the Global Illumination Gala Dinner 2008In the marriage that lasted over 21 years, Cassandra seemed to act as the traditional mother and wife and would ‘struggle to re-establish her career, following two decades of standing loyally by her husband’s side as a somewhat “traditional wife and mother”.’After their separation, it was rumoured that Stefanovic had agreed to a ‘orce financialproperty settlement’ and from the deal, Karl received $500,000 (£284,000) out of the couple’s combined net worth of $6.5 million (£3.7m) as well as his Mercedes Benz car. Cassandra got the remaining $6 million (£3.4m), 92 per cent of the asset pool.Creek, a managing director and special counsel in orce law, believed that Cassandra is able to enter the workforce and earn the same as her ex-husband. ‘Perhaps Mr Stefanovic is shortly to inherit a large fortune. Maybe he is heading off to the United States, where sports commentators earn more money than President Trump and all his children combined,’ he said.World Cup 2018 Day 1: Google Doodle celebrates FIFA tournament on opening dayDraymond Green trolls LeBron James over 2018 NBA Finals win at Warriors paradeCamila Cabello and Ariana Grande have public orce on TwitterGoogle Arts \u0026 Culture launch Road to Equality exhibition about women\u0027s movementThe Last of Us 2: All you need to know about the sequel after E3 2018 revealUS Open 2018 date, tee times, odds and how to watch on TVStella McCartney shop in London claims to have the \u0027purest air in the city\u0027Dumbo: All you need to know about Tim Burton\u0026#8217s live action remake after Disney releases teaser trailer World Cup 2026: FIFA tournament in the US, Canada and Mexico revealedPremier League fixtures 2018-2019: All you need to knowWho is Sanaa Lathan?

It was ruled the boy can return home with his care supervised by social services.Analysing the 44-page witness statement from a Carmarthenshire county Council social worker, Mr Justice Mostyn described the evidence as \u0027very long on rhetoric\u0027 but \u0027very short\u0027 on examples of \u0027deficient\u0027 parenting.  Speaking at the Family Division of the High Court in London, Mr Justice Mostyn said it was \u0027very hard\u0027 to pin down what exactly the social services had \u0027against\u0027 the mother.He said: \u0027The local authority\u0027s evidence in opposition to the mother\u0027s application was contained in an extremely long, 44-page, witness statement made by the social worker.\u0027          The case was heard at the The Royal Courts of Justice todayHe added: \u0027This witness statement was very long on rhetoric and generalised criticism but very short indeed on any concrete examples of where and how the mother\u0027s parenting had been deficient.\u0027 The social worker had been asked to \u0027identify her best example\u0027 of the mother failing to meet the boys emotional needs - to which she replied citing that she had not given him ice cream. \u0027Her response was that until prompted by the local authority mother had not spent sufficient one-to-one time with (the boy) and had failed on one occasion to take him out for an ice cream,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027This struck me as utterly insubstantial criticism.\u0027He added: \u0027A further criticism in this vein was that the mother had failed to arrange for (his) hair to be cut in the way that he liked.

She urged MPs to tell Leave voters to ‘suck it up’ and accept that free movement would have to continue as part of any Brexit deal. ‘Suck it up, suck it up and accept there is no alternative other than the customs union and single market,’ she said. ‘Let’s grab it and move on.’Her comments sparked fury, with fellow Tory Simon Clarke warning they would be met with ‘disbelief’ by Leave voters in his Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency. He told MPs: ‘My constituents voted to leave the EU precisely because they were not going to suck it up. They know what they voted for.‘If we break faith and ignore their voice we will create the most almighty problem for ourselves and have lost the chance to have a sensible debate around issues like immigration.’ Mrs May halted a major Tory rebellion on the EU Withdrawal Bill on Tuesday by agreeing to hold talks with rebel MPs on their demands.Government sources said the PM was willing to discuss the demand that MPs will get a guaranteed vote on Brexit, regardless of whether ministers succeed in striking a deal or not.But Mr Grieve and his supporters want the power to ‘direct’ the Government if talks fail – holding out the prospect that MPs could order ministers to stay in the single market or not even leave the EU at all. Mrs May yesterday said: ‘I cannot countenance Parliament being able to overturn the will of the British people.

Beck Dorey-Stein discusses her professional and private affairs while working as Obama\u0027s stenographer in From the Corner of the Oval The selective Quaker school in Washington has educated a lengthy roster of notable alumni from Teddy Roosevelt\u0027s son, Richard Nixon\u0027s daughter,  Al Gore\u0027s son, Chelsea Clinton, and the Obama girls, Malia and Sasha, as well as the children of members of Congress.Beck intended to only live in D.C. for the duration of the job – three months...\u0027because who wants to live in DC? – A one trick political pony town,\u0027 she writes. \u0027My job in the spring of 2011 was to help those hormonally-charged stressballs chill the f**k out\u0027, Beck writes while casting an eye to what looked like \u0027human Ken dolls in a short-sleeved button-down\u0027.Sitting across from one of them at the school one day flirting and thinking he was a teacher, the man told her he was working although he did not seem to be doing anything.He was a Secret Service agent watching Malia.In her new job assignment, Beck was advised by the hiring agency to stay away from the Secret Service agents as well as \u0027stay with your boyfriend\u0027.    She knew this was going to be her big break and felt confident leaving her boyfriend, Sam, back in Washington working for a PR firm writing speeches for gubernatorial candidates.He always encouraged her and supported her taking the job that would separate them.But Beck broke protocol of the job when she got involved in a hot and heavy secret sexual relationship with one of Obama\u0027s senior staffers in hotel rooms - and fell in love. Left with a broken heart and feeling duplicitous with too many nights at a bar getting drunk, she says the stolen thrill was worth the heartache although it cost her the relationship with her boyfriend in D.C.    Boarding Air Force One for the first time with an overstuffed duffel because she didn\u0027t know what not to pack, she thought she saw actor Jim Carrey sitting near the front of the plane.He turned out to be the man she fell hopelessly in love with, Jason Wolf - the man she left her hotel room door ajar for in foreign cities.Air Force One - where pool reporters had their own press cabin - has everything one could ask for in comfort – endless entrees, snacks, cocktails – except while on the luxury airliner, everyone paid for food and drinks.Rushing to unpack the first time in search of her steno gear and dumping out her computer bags on the seat next to her, out fell what looked like a vibrator – while one of Obama\u0027s traveling aides was standing there.          Beck\u0027s job was to record everything the president (pictured in 2008)  said, type it up, and release the transcript to the press office and presidential archive          Her new job would give her insight into the obscure party culture within the press pool, a glimpse of the president\u0027s personal life, and would even land her in a love affair with a White House stafferRed-faced, he hurried away.It was only a little travel-sized hot pink silk bag that resembled a vibrator – she wanted to tell him but didn\u0027t.Obama\u0027s traveling staff was almost all women and dubbed \u0027the Vagiants\u0027.This wasn\u0027t the case when he first took office in 2009 when there were few female senior staffers. Now it was the choice of the women to give themselves that name.\u0027Prudish? I would especially love it if the men in the West Wing nicknamed themselves the 10-Inch Senior Staffs\u0027, she writes.Beck was one of three stenographers rotating on the travel schedule.On international trips, media chipped in and chartered a private plane dubbed the \u0027party plane.\u0027Neither POTUS or senior White House staff traveled on it and the president stayed at a different hotel.The press charter arrived a day ahead of POTUS and Air Force One so TV networks could set up their live shots.On her first trip out, Beck found herself in $500-a night hotel rooms with breathtaking views of Cabo San Lucas before continuing on to Costa Rica, Tanzania, Laos. She\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, international incidents they\u0027ve witnessed – from George H.W. puking on the prime minister of Japan, Reagan in Rome falling asleep in front of the pope, Monica Lewinsky, 911, and Katrina.\u0027Pinch me because how is this scene my real life\u0027? Beck writes.Her first overseas trips on Air Force One took her to Thailand, Myanmar, and Cambodia where Obama requested an unscheduled stop at the Shwedagon Pagoda, the oldest Buddhist stupa in the world.          Beck admits she had a fling with a White House staffer Jason Wolf, who broke her heart           She recalls how the everyone in the press cabin took their drug of choice and how she\u0027d listen to old-timer boozy party animals tell stories about the different administrations, presidents, and international incidents they\u0027ve witnessedLooking out of the plane\u0027s window while flying into Myanmar, Obama saw the glare of the 451 diamonds encrusting the top of the Buddha and requested a stop.Traveling on to Cambodia, Beck walked out with the press and left recording equipment attached in the room where the president had met with the Japanese prime minister.This could have been interpreted as a spy tactic with a recorder still running. But any disaster was avoided by Wolf, who quickly removed the equipment.  Wolf never talked about his serious relationship with his girlfriend Brooke back home in LA whose father was a famous producer.Beck would leave her hotel room door open for him so he could sneak in at night.   They carried on across the globe while Beck tried to keep her boyfriend Sam out of her mind.She describes experiencing \u0027the best sleepover party ever\u0027 where everyone took their drug of choice on long flights – Sonata, Xanax or Ambien – which made any \u0027awkward intimacy with colleagues suddenly just funny and bizarre,\u0027 she writes. Heading for Delhi in India where the president met the prime minister, Beck was warned about the destitution, the starving children in the streets, begging mothers, sick and thin dogs lying around waiting for death and piles of trash everywhere.But no one on this trip saw any of that.          Beck saw how Obama coped with stress and grief over 60 foreign trips, cracked his Nicorette gum to keep from smoking, and on one occasion told stories about how he met First Lady MichelleThey were always protected from seeing the poverty in these countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets.\u0027We do not see the slums or hear the screams. No matter where we are in the world, Dar es Salaam or Indianapolis, the field always looks the same: red carpet, white tent, blue velvet drape\u0027.Through a ten-day swing through Africa – Senegal, South Africa, Tanzania where they were advised not to drink the water, the physical risks didn\u0027t compare to the emotional ones, according to the author.\u0027Nothing is scary when the Secret Service is around you\u0027, Beck writes, but she became ill in South Africa after ingesting water on a lettuce leaf. In Jamaica, Obama visited the one-time home of reggae master Bob Marley and sang Marley\u0027s hit, \u0027Three Little Birds in his bedroom – and then on to Panama.The crew traveled with him for the First Family Christmas vacation in Hawaii and for his summer vacation on Martha\u0027s Vineyard.Obama left the Vineyard to deal with ISIS on the rise in the Middle East, Putin revving his power in Eastern Europe and the outbreak of Ebola in Africa – before returning to the Vineyard when the news broke that ISIS had beheaded photojournalist Jim Foley.POTUS made his televised statement the following morning after allowing the family to grieve.\u0027No one in that room can deny the power and sincerity of the president\u0027s address. But even more remarkable than the president\u0027s palpable anger – the sound that follows his words: unprecedented silence\u0027.          While traveling, they were always protected from seeing the poverty in third-world countries and instead saw a \u0027glossy, two-dimensional Disney World version\u0027 while motorcading manicured streets The press were allowed no questions.\u0027And then the president goes golfing\u0027, Beck writes.Negative news stories condemned Obama\u0027s decision to play golf in the wake of such a tragedy but \u0027that exercise is how POTUS copes with stress and grief\u0027, the author writes.\u0027Golf doesn\u0027t provide the president an escape it allows him the only breathing room he\u0027s afforded\u0027.He can\u0027t just go for a walk and hasn\u0027t run outside since 2007.\u0027His influence circles the globe, but his physical freedom is limited to eighteen holes\u0027.\u0027It\u0027s lonely at the top\u0027.CNN pays homage to Bourdain with tribute show that includes...Dennis Rodman CRIES live on CNN as he reveals how Obama...Share this articleWith the end of Obama\u0027s term in sight, Beck wanted to be outside the HRC bubble and away from what felt like power players in Washington hungry to prove something.It was hard for her to imagine not traveling together with this crew of colleagues she had circled the globe with in Air Force One.She remembered the words of Von, the White House butler on her first day who had told her: \u0027It\u0027s just a job.\u0027 \u0027We are nothing special, just lucky,\u0027 she writes.  It was a privilege, an honor, and a job.Her affair with Jason was over and he went back to LA and married his girlfriend.Sam, her old boyfriend, was long gone and back in the arms of his first girlfriend.The author stayed on with the Trump administration –  or what she describes as the \u0027insane clown posse\u0027 – and the White House executive parking lot now filled with Porsches and Maseratis\u0027s instead of Priuses and Chevys.What was once joy has become \u0027a waking nightmare.

Mr Rosenheim says many of the portraits were sourced from the South in particular, but little else is known about them.Many studios at the time were small and didn\u0027t last long, but at least one studio, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee was more established and has been identified in a number of the portraits by a small plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits.The full horror of fighting in the trenches revealed:...Early landscape painting by Vincent Van Gogh of women...Share this articleDuring wartime, photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, but particularly during World War II, American culture was shifting \u0027seismically\u0027, Mr Rosenheim says.   The Great Depression had ended and more money was in circulation, so people could treat themselves to portraits – which they hadn\u0027t been able to as much before – and the middle class grew. It also helps that the process of taking portraits was less easier and less expensive than it had been before, according to The Met.\u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes,\u0027 a statement says.          Though little is known about many of the studios, at least one, the Daisy Studio in Memphis, Tennessee has been identified in a number of portraits by a small  plaque in the bottom corners of the portraits like this portrait from 1942          It was during wartime that photographic studios became a popular place for communities to gather, as the middle class grew and the culture was shifting          The Met press release says: \u0027Using waterproof direct positive paper rather than film, the studios were able to offer their clientele high quality, inexpensive portraits in a matter of minutes\u0027Mr Rosenheim says: \u0027I started seeing these pictures and I realized they had poignancy and were entrancing and simple and many soldiers and sailors and airmen and women posing in their uniforms… and the way they look at the camera and the way their sisters and children and mothers look at the camera and the way friends pose with each other and look at the camera, is just particularly special. \u0027Because it was a time of great change in the US and it was on the cusp of the Civil Rights era. It was the beginning of the second great migration from the South. And it was also a time of introspection.\u0027He adds: \u0027The show is kind of inspired by Frederick Douglass, who argued, at the time of slavery, that even after slavery ended, which he hoped would be soon, that he did not think African Americans would be fully free until they could imagine themselves and project themselves using photography as an act of self-expression. And to replace the negative images of African Americans with positive ones. And that\u0027s what I see in these pictures as an inspiration.\u0027          \u0027The poignancy of these small photographs lies in the essential respect the camera offers its subjects, who sit for their portraits as an act of self-expression,\u0027 the release says          Though some of the backdrops were plain, many portraits were taken in front of elaborate painted backgrounds of forests, lakes and flowers, like this one          This portrait from 1945 shows a woman posing in front of a painted backdrop of a lake, with mountains and flowers  Though few of the subjects have been identified beyond a possible first name or personal note written on the back, Mr Rosenheim hopes that the opening of the exhibit will help curators be able to identify as many of the subjects and portrait studios as they can.\u0027I’m hoping that… people coming to see the show will recognize family members or distant friends or say, doesn’t this look like so and so? Haven’t I seen this face before? I really hope that people will contact us,\u0027 he says.\u0027Mathematically, the youngest people that went to fight in World War II are dying or have just recently died… People who lived a long time. These are people who lived until their 80s or 90s. And so we’re on the cusp of no one knowing who these people are.

It was ruled the boy can return home with his care supervised by social services.Analysing the 44-page witness statement from a Carmarthenshire county Council social worker, Mr Justice Mostyn described the evidence as \u0027very long on rhetoric\u0027 but \u0027very short\u0027 on examples of \u0027deficient\u0027 parenting.  Speaking at the Family Division of the High Court in London, Mr Justice Mostyn said it was \u0027very hard\u0027 to pin down what exactly the social services had \u0027against\u0027 the mother.He said: \u0027The local authority\u0027s evidence in opposition to the mother\u0027s application was contained in an extremely long, 44-page, witness statement made by the social worker.\u0027          The case was heard at the The Royal Courts of Justice todayHe added: \u0027This witness statement was very long on rhetoric and generalised criticism but very short indeed on any concrete examples of where and how the mother\u0027s parenting had been deficient.\u0027 The social worker had been asked to \u0027identify her best example\u0027 of the mother failing to meet the boys emotional needs - to which she replied citing that she had not given him ice cream. \u0027Her response was that until prompted by the local authority mother had not spent sufficient one-to-one time with (the boy) and had failed on one occasion to take him out for an ice cream,\u0027 said the judge.\u0027This struck me as utterly insubstantial criticism.\u0027He added: \u0027A further criticism in this vein was that the mother had failed to arrange for (his) hair to be cut in the way that he liked.

Mr Grieve followed just before 10.45am. Shortly afterwards came Tom Baldwin, who was Labour ex-leader Ed Miliband’s spin doctor and now works for People’s Vote, and James McGrory, the former communications director at Stronger In, the official Remain campaign, who now works for Open Britain.Mr Grieve left just before midday. Most of the other participants left around 1pm, including Baroness Altmann, the anti-Brexit Tory peer, Patience Wheatcroft, the Tory peer and former newspaper editor who has backed a second referendum and has argued ‘we have to stop Brexit’, and the Lib Dem Brexit spokesman in the Lords, Sarah Ludford.They were joined by AC Grayling, the philosopher who has said it was wrong to ‘normalise acceptance of leaving the EU’.The meeting reveals that separate Remainer groups are coordinating to try to stop Britain’s departure from the EU. On Tuesday night Mr Grieve told the Commons he was not trying to prevent Brexit but ‘legitimately looking at the detail of one of the most complex legal and political exercises in which we have ever engaged in peacetime’.In an interview with The Guardian last month, he backed another national poll to ask the public ‘is this what you really want?’ but also claimed he was ‘not working to precipitate it’.

She urged MPs to tell Leave voters to ‘suck it up’ and accept that free movement would have to continue as part of any Brexit deal. ‘Suck it up, suck it up and accept there is no alternative other than the customs union and single market,’ she said. ‘Let’s grab it and move on.’Her comments sparked fury, with fellow Tory Simon Clarke warning they would be met with ‘disbelief’ by Leave voters in his Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency.

Fellow Tory Philip Davies said those calling for a meaningful vote ‘would be betraying the result of the referendum’.Eurosceptic MP Daniel Kawczynski last night urged Leave voters to boot out Tory rebels trying to thwart Brexit.He added: ‘Some MPs still clearly don’t wish to respect the will of the British people.

Consider not merely its proprietary combination of succulence and crispness and flavour, but also its usefulness as a symbol of the time in which we find ourselves. Consider its substance, derived from the world’s most common bird, bred to reach maturity within weeks, and with a breast so large it can barely walk. Consider that 60 billion of these birds are slaughtered every year, resulting in an abundant source of cheap food, and that this work necessitates a vast pool of cheap human labour. And consider that, long after humans have disappeared from the Earth, what will remain of us, along with the immortal residue of nuclear waste, is a fossil record that will register the truly insane volume of chicken carcasses we left behind.In the early pages of their book A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things, Raj Patel and Jason W Moore ask us to consider the McNugget as the reigning symbol of the modern era. One of their central contentions is that we are no longer living in the Holocene, but in a new geological era they refer to as the Capitalocene – the currently fashionable term “Anthropocene”, they argue, suggests that our current state of ecological emergency is merely the result of humans doing what humans do, whereas the reality is that it flows out of the specific historical phenomenon of capitalism. As a term, then, Capitalocene is designed to nudge us away from evolutionary determinism, and from a sense of collective culpability for climate change, towards an understanding of the way in which the destruction of nature has largely been the result of an economic system organised around a minority class and its pursuit of profit. “We may all be in the same boat when it comes to climate change,” as they put it, “but most of us are in steerage.”Patel and Moore’s essential argument is that the history of capitalism, and therefore of our current mess, can be usefully viewed through the lens of cheapness. (An earlier, more knottily theoretical work of eco-Marxism by Moore, Capitalism in the Web of Life, argues that “cheap nature” is as central an imperative of capitalism as cheap labour.) The seven “things” of their misleadingly clickbaity title are not objects or consumer products, so much as conceptual categories: nature, money, work, care, food, energy and lives. They present these categories as reliant on each other for their cheapness, as enmeshed in a kind of ecosystem. In the chapter on cheap money, they demonstrate the process of cheapening through the barbaric silver mining practices of 16th-century Spanish colonialists in Peru. “Cheap lives turned into cheap workers dependent on cheap care and cheap food in home communities, requiring cheap fuel to collect and process cheap nature to produce cheap money.”One of the most persuasive aspects of Patel and Moore’s argument, in this sense, is their demonstration of the extent to which capitalism’s reliance on cheap labour is itself reliant on what they call cheap care – the domestic work mostly performed for nothing, and mostly by women, that is rarely factored into the cost of labour. Capitalism has created a binary opposition between this care work and the “real work” it makes possible. “Writing a history of work without care work,” they write, “would be like writing an ecology of fish without mentioning the water. It’d be possible, in a limited fashion, but, once you’d realised the omission, hard to continue.”The book itself is not much over 200 pages, followed by a further hundred or so of notes and references – a high proportion of which can be taken to illustrate Patel and Moore’s extreme scholarly hyperactivity. They date the Capitalocene’s year zero not to the dawn of the industrial revolution or to the dropping of the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, but to the beginning of European colonial expansion into the Americas in the 16th century. This is the crucial historical juncture not just because it pushed out the frontier – one of the book’s central contentions is that capitalism lives by the often bloody expansion of frontiers – but because it provided a testing ground for new European ideas about the ision between nature and society. Enlightenment thinkers such as Descartes and Bacon, they argue, legitimated colonial violence through this conceptual ision, which led to the relegation of indigenous peoples to the category of nature.In the book’s exploration of how capitalism secured the cheapness of a particular “thing”, each chapter begins with some or other aspect of this colonial original sin. All but one, in fact, begin with Columbus, whom the authors intend to stand, in all his viciousness and greed, for capitalism itself – which, they argue, is historically inseparable from colonialism. Capitalism’s frontiers are “the encounter zones between capital and all kinds of nature – humans included. They are always, then, about reducing the costs of doing business. Capitalism not only has frontiers it exists only through frontiers.”It’s not something the book goes into, but while reading it I found myself thinking about how the notion of colonising Mars, as advanced by entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, represents the most extreme operation of this logic in our time. Capitalism is running out of frontiers, and the legacy of its monomaniacal pursuit of cheap resources is a devastated planet that may soon be unliveable for vast numbers of its inhabitants. Mars exists as the possibility of a new frontier, a means of keeping capitalism alive after its current host-organism, Earth, has been drained of the ability to support life.If Patel and Moore don’t quite make it to Mars, their book still covers an awful lot of ground. They move rapidly between economic analysis, history and political polemic, all in service of the premise that all the cheapness has in fact been catastrophically expensive. Their movement is not always fluid or seamless the authors have a tendency to end their chapters with inelegant mechanisms of transition. The chapter on cheap care, for instance, concludes with the assertion that “it is to cheap food that we now turn” the chapter on cheap food ends with “it is to cheap energy that we now turn” – and so on. You can almost hear the click and whirr of an old-style projector as the next slide turns over. But occasional clunkiness is only a minor issue the overall impression is one of sweeping erudition, and an impressive ability to synthesise disparate elements.The book ends with a brief but hopeful conclusion, introducing an idea the authors refer to as “reparation ecology”. The concept is delineated only hastily, and hazily, though it involves a broad redistribution of natural and cultural resources, and a proper valuation of all the things capitalism has cheapened over the centuries. There’s no real attempt to work through how this might be achieved it’s offered less as a programme than as a provocation to imagine a future outside of capitalism’s violent imperatives. It’s an invitation, as they put it, to “dream seditiously”.Mark O’Connell’s To Be a Machine won this year’s Wellcome book prize.• A History of the World in Seven Cheap Things is published by Verso.

Flags should be allowed.”Another said: “Seriously? Royal Mail you should be ashamed,” a Twitter user said. “Allow people pride in this country. It’s a sporting event, drop the pathetic politics and allow people to just have fun and celebrate.”“Wouldn’t have happened in Postman Pat’s day,” added another.However, others supported the decision. “These are professional vehicles and it shows a lack of taste and decorum to start draping random flags and other assorted insignia from them,” said one tweeter.Royal Mail said it had a duty of care to employees and members of the public and therefore flags should not be flown on vehicles. The company-wide policy also bans stickers from Royal Mail’s trollies, bikes, vans and lorries. “No other flag or insignia should be carried next to the Royal Mail brand and insignias,” the company said.“Flags placed on vehicles can obscure the driver’s view. They can also pose a hazard to other road users if they are lost when the vehicle is moving.

The really encouraging aspect to today’s figures is the breadth of positive data, with growth posted across the different parts of the retail sector. We shouldn’t get carried away as it’s still very tough out there, but the truth is that despite continued rumours of the demise of our retail industry, many retailers are simply getting on with the job and continuing to attract customers through their doors.Football fever could give retailers another lift, he adds:Of course, we’re not going to have a heatwave and a Royal Wedding to help drive sales every month, but the World Cup kick off should help supermarkets in particular maintain this momentum over the next month or so.”The recent pick-up in UK wages may also be driving retail sales higher, suggests Chris Williamson of Markit. The unexpectedly strong UK retail sales figures have sent the pound sharply higher.More on the Meghan and Harry effect from the ONS:Food stores provided a positive contribution to growth with supermarkets commenting on good sales in celebration of the Royal Wedding during good weather. Newsflash: UK retail sales were stronger than expected in May, new figures from the Office for National Statistics show.The ONS says there are two factors - good weather in May, and the Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle (now the Duchess of Sussex). This encouraged spending on food (all those Royal Wedding BBQs?) and on household goods.Retail sales had been suppressed by the bad weather earlier in the year, when ice and snow kept shoppers off the streets. Things seem to be improving now, though, with sales rising in line with temperatures:Today’s ECB meeting is the first since Italy’s new coalition government was sworn in, and began announcing policies that could breach Europe’s budget rules.A clash is brewing between Brussels and Rome, even though Italy’s new finance minister has insisted the country is committed to the euro.The ECB is often accused of being too political -- Mario Draghi regularly chides elected politicians to implement structural reforms.But on this occasion, the governing council may be keen to take its big decisions on QE before a crisis blows up.Bank of America Merrill Lynch say:“We believe the ECB may be in a hurry to close the QE chapter,” “We think this is essentially political, as the ECB would not want its monetary policy to be affected by claims of supporting or conversely impairing the new policy course in Italy.”Economists and investors are split over whether the European Central Bank will make a decision about its stimulus programme today, or kick the can down the road to July’s mereting.Elsa Lignos of Royal Bank of Canada predicts the ECB will have an “active debate” about whether to let its QE programme expire in September. However, she doesn’t expect the final decision until July’s meeting, adding:Draghi will almost certainly be grilled on the Italian situation in the Q\u0026ampA but we doubt that he will let himself be drawn in.Paul Donovan of UBS Wealth Management suggests we shouldn’t expect a major announcement from the ECB today: ECB President Draghi’s extensive rehabilitation to overcome an addiction to easing seems to have paid off.There are hopes of either 1) an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying, or 2) an announcement of an announcement of the timetable to end bond buying.Marchel Alexandrovich, senior european economist at Jefferies, says investors want to know more than just the end-date of QE:After more than three years of QE, and against the background of what Peter Praet judges to be improving inflation dynamics, the ECB is preparing to end its net asset purchases. Whether the formal announcement comes this week, or in July (our guess), and what profile the taper will take (a straight 3 months drawdown to zero, or something more creative) are the immediate questions.But at this point in the process, a few months and a few extra billion in purchases either way are not crucial the markets are more focused on how the ECB amends its interest rate guidance, any technical changes around bond reinvestments and whether Draghi delivers a relatively dovish taper by leaving the door open to the possibility of restarting the programme if the recovery were to splutter.European stock markets are in the red this morning, as central banks hog the headlines.This follows a down day on Wall Street, where the Dow lost 119 points to 25,201 points last night.Traders are worried that the Federal Reserve will raise US interest rates too aggressively over the next 18 months.Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at interactive investor, explains: As Fed chairman Jerome Powell acknowledges, the risk remains that officials overcook it and bring an end to the Trump trade once and for all. Achieving the ‘not too fast, not too slow’ Goldilocks approach to monetary policy will be key to extending the equities bull run.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.All eyes are on Riga as the European Central Bank weighs up whether to pull the plug on its stimulus programme, despite signs that the eurozone recovery is slowing.The ECB governing council faces a tricky decision as it holds its monetary policy meeting in Latvia today. Its huge bond-buying stimulus programme runs out in September, so policymakers must decide whether to call time - or extend the scheme into 2019.The ECB has bought more than €2.5 trillion bonds under its quantitative easing (QE) programme, in an attempt to fight off deflation. It’s currently committed to buying €30bn per month until September.Hawks on the council believe the scheme has run its course, and would like to pull the plug. But, with growth slowing in the eurozone - particularly in Germany - and geopolitical tensions growing, the ECB may be reluctant to turn off the QE tap.A decision could be delayed until July’s meeting, but at the very least the governing council must discuss the issue today. They must tread cautiously, or risk spooking the markets and triggering a sell-off.Traders will be keen to hear Mario Draghi’s views at the press conference following the decision. President Draghi should expect questions on trade war fears, and the new government in Italy.Konstantinos Anthis, head of research at ADS Securities, explains: The stakes are high for the ECB President, and for many people he has to send a message that the European central bank is planning to end its asset purchases’ program and the date to start that has to be September.There has been a lot of chatter leading up to this meeting and if, for whatever reason, Draghi fails to deliver what investors expect then the euro will be in trouble.The ECB will also release its latest growth and inflation projections, which will help determine what they do today.Fed chair Jerome Powell insisted that America’s economy can handle higher borrowing costs, declaring:“The decision you see today is another sign the US economy is in great shape.“Growth is strong, labour markets are strong, inflation is close to target.”Plus, it’s a bad day for Rolls-Royce workers as the engineering firm announces thousand of job cuts."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7632b02e40c5fbe0842864087bf88e474c18b70e/458_0_3332_2000/master/3332.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=589465a1caf5269c6d5191e7a6484a98","title":"suits fruit and scooters 30 years of hanois 36 streets in pictures","story":"William E Crawford was one of the first western photographers to work in postwar north Vietnam.

In fact, with a few deft sentences, he laid bare the hypocrisy that dominates much of the climate debate.The occasion was the gathering of fossil fuel executives at the Vatican, one of a series of meetings to mark the third anniversary of Laudato Si, his majestic encyclical on global warming. The meetings were closed, but by all accounts Big Oil put forward its usual anodyne arguments: any energy transition must be slow, moving too fast to renewable energy would hurt the poor by raising prices, and so forth.In response, Francis graciously thanked the oil executives for attending, and for “developing more careful approaches to the assessment of climate risk”. But then he got down to business. “Is it enough?” he asked. “Will we turn the corner in time? No one can answer that with certainty, but with each month that passes, the challenge of energy transition becomes more pressing.” Two and a half years after the Paris climate talks, he pointed out, “carbon dioxide emissions and atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases remain very high. This is disturbing and a cause for real concern.” Indeed.What’s really “worrying”, though, “is the continued search for new fossil fuel reserves, whereas the Paris agreement clearly urged keeping most fossil fuels underground”. And in that small sentence he calls the bluff on most of what passes for climate action among nations and among fossil fuel companies. Yes, Donald Trump notwithstanding, most countries have begun to take some steps to reduce demand for energy over time. Yes, oil companies have begun to grudgingly issue “climate risk reports” and ert minuscule percentages of their research budgets to renewables.In fact, as Francis points out, it’s not just that these companies and countries are committed to digging up the reserves they currently have. Even more insanely, they’re out there exploring for more. Companies like Exxon devote billions and billions of dollars to finding new oil fields, even though we have far more oil than we could ever safely burn.All of this is morally wrong, as Francis points out. “Decisive progress cannot be made without an increased awareness that all of us are part of one human family, united by bonds of fraternity and solidarity. Only by thinking and acting with constant concern for this underlying unity that overrides all differences, only by cultivating a sense of universal intergenerational solidarity, can we set out really and resolutely on the road ahead,” he says.Which is great – it’s the job of religious leaders to remind us to think beyond our own self-interest.But Francis also understands that our current approach makes no mathematical sense. We can’t have a nice, slow, easy transition because we can’t put barely any more carbon in the atmosphere. We must solve the problem of energy access for the poor by using renewables, not fossil fuel, because “our desire to ensure energy for all must not lead to the undesired effect of a spiral of extreme climate changes due to a catastrophic rise in global temperatures, harsher environments and increased levels of poverty”. Above all, we’ve got to pay as much attention to actual reality as we do to political reality: “Civilization requires energy, but energy use must not destroy civilization!”It’s odd to have the pope schooling energy executives on the math of carbon. But actually, no odder than NFL quarterbacks schooling politicians on racial injustice, or high school kids schooling a nation on the danger of guns. Amid the unprecedented wave of nonsense coming from DC, it’s good to remember that there are still people of all kinds able to pierce through the static and the shouting. Good common sense speaks even more loudly when it comes from unexpected corners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/203a516a2bc9e4ffcc30d516601d325f9f642839/98_46_5879_3529/master/5879.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c379e5904e0824eb06a8201b969d3e29","title":"kate hoeys quirks are no longer funny she should resign","story":"The Labour Brexiter is completely out of tune with anyone who votes for herThe Tory party isn’t the only one with its mavericks, its lone wolves, its daredevil firebrands who will choose garbled controversialism over consistency just for the lols.

Thousands of workers will be hitAn extraordinary statement, especially from an executive invited to tea and biscuits with May. If supposedly tame industrialists now talk like this, you have to wonder what sounds come out of the feral lot.Yet the CBI’s impatience is shared by many. Once the long-haul arm of the Tory movement, the Freight Transport Association lashed out at May last week for “playing chicken with crucial parts of the British economy and the livelihoods of … 7 million Britons”.These are close friends of the Conservative party.As one senior representative of a leading business organisation says: “Over the past two years, most company bosses would never risk saying openly that Brexit is turning out to be a disaster, in case it scared off their best staff.” With fewer than 290 days before Britain formally leaves the EU, their caution is running out.This is a far bigger story than the one on the front pages about who promised which amendment to which band of Tories. One of the fundamental relationships in the establishment is fracturing – and the consequences for government and economy could prove to be historic.An iron rule of British politics is that the Conservatives mean business, and business means the Conservatives. Despite an early falling-out with Margaret Thatcher and a dalliance with Tony Blair, blue remains home corner for commercial companies and champions of cutting taxes and trimming red tape to a minimum. Yet in May’s two years as prime minister, business has either been cast as the enemy or relegated to a walk-on part. In that chaotic summer of 2016, as senior Tories stabbed each other in the back and themselves in the front, May was quick to grasp that many leave voters were sticking up two fingers at the British way of doing capitalism. Neither an ex-banker nor marinaded in Treasury culture, she happily blasted “unscrupulous bosses” and “corporate irresponsibility”. Among her aides was the enthusiastic leaver, Nick Timothy, whose masterplan was to use Brexit to win over working-class voters who had been chucked overboard by New Labour.Once in No 10, May’s schemes for putting workers on company boards and blocking Chinese funding of British nuclear plants turned to dust. Yet on the central policy issue of our time, business remains stuck in a non-speaking role.The EU Withdrawal Bill – once known as the Great Repeal Bill – is going through the House of Commons to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and transpose all existing EU legislation into domestic UK law, which will avoid a \u0027cliff-edge\u0027 change on the day after we leave the EU.\u0026nbspParts of the bill have been highly controversial, and MPs have tabled hundreds of amendments to try and change its wording, including a significant number of Conservative rebels. Some of the key controversies include its use of so-called Henry VIII powers, which will give government ministers the power to tweak the wording of laws to make sure they make sense in UK legislation - but those changes could take place without having to go through parliament. MPs have called this a power grab by the government. The government estimates around 800 to 1,000 measures called statutory instruments will be required to make sure the bill is applied correctly.\u0026nbspOther concerns include the government\u0027s decision not to include the EU charter of fundamental rights in the law being transposed. Other amendments are attempts to affect the Brexit process, including legislating for a transitional period and giving MPs a binding meaningful vote on the deal secured by Theresa May, before the deal is finalised.Take the all-important triggering of article 50: May announced it in her first conference speech as leader, just weeks after the referendum vote and before parliament had resumed. Forget about consulting industry and finance: she didn’t even give them notice.After last summer’s election debacle, and Timothy’s exit, May’s new team set up a conciliatory business advisory council that meets in Downing Street every three months or so. A long way short of the Brexit business task force called for by the CBI and others, its rotating membership – one month WPP, the next Rolls-Royce – makes it almost useless as a forum for formal input. Unsurprisingly, it was after one of these council meetings that Drechsler exploded.Ministers and aides try to calm the waters. Their efforts, while appreciated by people in business I have spoken to, are rendered void against the bungling and botching that marks the negotiations. The tens of billions taxpayers give business in subsidies and tax reliefs are now taken for granted. For as long as Brexit is treated by May first and foremost as a way to keep her own cabinet and party together, the private sector will remain frozen out. Anything else it would like – from a third runway at Heathrow to a proper industrial strategy – gets parked on the long list marked “any other business”.Imagine you are a senior manager at a major carmaker. Over the past two years, you have been assured that you would continue to “operate within” the European single market. Except that turned into “frictionless” trade – which then became “as frictionless as possible”. Meanwhile, the cabinet dreams up “customs partnerships” and other unicorns destined only to be waved away by Michel Barnier – and Boris Johnson is wittering on about yet another bloody bridge. How are you meant to plan around any of that? The answer is that the worst-case scenarios your team drew up in 2016 are, by 2018, your base case.No longer is it just banks and pharmaceutical firms looking overseas. Britain’s biggest car manufacturer, Jaguar Land Rover, warned this week it would shift production of its Discovery 4x4 from Solihull to EU member Slovakia. That can be explained away as focusing Midlands staff on making electric cars – but just last September, the firm said its presence in Slovakia was a “hedge” against Brexit uncertainty.The problem this poses for the rest of us is very real and very easy to sum up. Among all the 28 members of the EU, the UK ranks second only to Ireland on its level of inward investment. As Kevin Farnsworth at the University of York points out, from Thatcher onwards, British governments have touted for capital investment from abroad. It’s why George Osborne cut corporation tax so low and went on tours of China and India. It’s also why the Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, says the UK relies on “the kindness of strangers”. That dependence has grown as Britain has lost more and more of its own businesses and become instead a branch-plant economy for the rest of the world. And that kindness is now being strained by a blundering Brexit. Soon the headlines will be not just about a few hundred jobs moving out of the City – but of firms scrapping their expansion plans, or factories shifting to Poland, or thousands of jobs going at a stroke of a pen.It was always a rotten and unsafe model. The irony is, it is a Conservative government that now appears intent on tearing it down – with nothing to replace it. In place of a strategy, you get the panic that broke out in Downing Street when Nissan threatened to take its money elsewhere – resulting in a private meeting with the Japanese carmaker and a series of promises made in a secret “comfort letter”. This is no more an economic policy than a bunch of flowers bought at a service station is a Valentine’s present.But then, this has been the decade in which the political and policymaking elite has inflicted upon itself wound after wound. First came the fiasco of austerity, and an economy that refused to bounce back as Osborne and Carney promised it would. Then came the Brexit referendum that Cameron claimed he had in the bag. And that has produced the slow dissolution of the Tory-corporate coalition central to contemporary British capitalism.With all that as the background, why wouldn’t you opt for a bit of beach-reading escapism?• Aditya Chakrabortty is a  columnist and senior economics commentator"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82592fe9a6f09bb07c6b37f01d0e83677de12998/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=465b372698893343097ba222137aed78","title":"can cricket become the game of choice for young bme women","story":"Cricket has a huge following among the BME community – particularly south Asians – yet few women try their hand at the sport. Two Leicestershire women have set out to change thatGrowing up in Pakistan, Nafeesa Katib remembers watching cricket with her siblings on a TV hired at the weekend as a treat. It wasn’t a viewing choice at the time – it was the only thing being broadcast – but she remembers it fondly. “Even if we didn’t like cricket we had to watch it, and in the end all of us fell in love with the game,” she says. She remembers thinking: “Where are all the women on the cricket field?” That thought stuck with her after she moved to the UK as a teenager. Now 41, and living in Leicestershire with her husband and two children of her own, she is helping to redress that imbalance, in her role as a cricket coach for girls aged eight to 14. Her hope is to be a role model to all the girls who attend her sessions – but also to show, as a visibly Muslim woman playing and teaching cricket, that a headscarf need not stop anyone playing sport. “If you’ve got somebody who inspires you, who shows you, yes, I can do it, it’s a great feeling. And that’s what I try do,” says Katib.Women’s cricket has never been more popular in the UK – 2017 was a landmark year, as millions watched the England team triumph in the Women’s Cricket World Cup in front of a sold-out crowd at Lord’s. In the wake of that result, the cricket governing board said it was committed to getting more south Asian women involved in the game.One reason is the lack of appropriate coaching and facilities. In Oadby, where Katib lives, there were no organised sporting activities for her nine-year-old daughter on a Saturday morning – until cricket came along. “Most of the things are aimed at boys, like the football clubs for example,” says Katib. “There were some crafty things for girls, but not all girls are into arts and crafts.”Her friend and fellow coach Mai Kazi emphasises that the scheduling of sports sessions can be an issue, particularly for kids who come from a Muslim background. “Most of the Muslim kids in the area go to Islamic school between 4pm and 6pm, and that’s when most of the clubs are held,” says Kazi. But a Saturday morning works perfectly for her and her 13-year-old daughter, and the sessions are something they now do together. The coaches have worked hard to create a safe environment for girls from all backgrounds, who might be feeling apprehensive about throwing themselves into the game.“There are a few girls who wear headscarves,” says Katib. “The first time they came they were very nervous and really worried about them, with one hand touching their head at all times. But over time I’ve been able to give them a bit of confidence. At the end of the day, it’s all girls there.”Although having women run the sessions has boosted participation from the local Muslim and south Asian community, it’s the sight of two familiar faces that encourages parents to keep bringing their kids back. “A lot of the mums that drop their girls off know us from school,” says Kazi. “We live in a very small borough, so it’s the kind of place where everyone knows each other. There is obviously the sense of: ‘Oh, this is run by someone we know.’”She believes that community feeling is essential to the project’s success: “The fact it’s very local has really appealed to people – otherwise, they’d have to travel to Leicester, which isn’t always possible.”Katib has just completed her level two coaching certificate and hopes, one day, to run her own club.

Entrepreneurial experts share their hard-learned lessons, from the genuinely useful to what to avoidDon’t get lost in the crowdYou may think your product is better than everything else, but without something distinctive about it, it’s not going to stand out. “When I do consultancy work occasionally and, say, someone’s made a new T-shirt, I’ll say: ‘What’s so good about it?’” says Kuldip Singh Sahota, founder and chief executive of Mr Singh’s chilli sauces and crisps. “They’ll say, the fabric or design, but that’s what everyone says. What’s going to make you stand out? That’s where your brand and authenticity comes in, especially in such a crowded market.”Dave Bailey, a business coach and entrepreneur, agrees: “When you’re starting a new business, you have to get people to believe what you believe. And they’re never going to believe someone they think is fake or doing it for the wrong reasons.”Do have a good storyIt’s the entrepreneur who can spin a good yarn who gains a head start. For Sahota, that was the chilli sauce recipe his father Hardev “Pops” Singh Sahota had perfected over decades in the family’s shed in east London. They now sell sauces globally.“Everyone loves a good story, don’t they,” says Sahota. “It’s something customers can relate to but also, in our case, it helped us stand out with retailers who we wanted to stock our products.” To highlight the backstory, Sahota cast his father in a series of online comedy music videos to promote the brand.Don’t think all advice is good adviceIf launching a business or a product is like having a baby, entrepreneurs face a similar barrage of well-meaning, often contradictory advice from family, friends and a million business books. “Sarah Wood, the co-founder of the video ad tech company Unruly, once said the best piece of advice she ever got was that advice itself was overrated,” says startups’s Shane Donnelly.Sahota hates the kind of motivational self-help quotes that flood Instagram – “An investment in yourself pays the best interest” and all that sort of thing. “It starts off really well intentioned but it can really get on top of you after a while, so I ignore it all now,” he says.Do ask for experience not advice“A lot of advice is regret in disguise,” Bailey says. “Everyone’s got an experience, but rather than ask for advice, I often recommend asking for that experience.” In other words, not so much “what would you do?” but “what did you do?” – then make your own decision.“The worst advice I got was when I called this big wholesaler in east London and he said: ‘My biggest piece of advice for you is just quit, this is really hard’”, Sahota recalls. “And then he goes: ‘I’ll take a pallet off you if you want.’ And I remember thinking: ‘You told me to quit but you also want a pallet of my sauces? I’ll show you.’”Don’t stick with a product beyond its sell by dateBuilding a product around yourself only enhances your emotional attachment to your baby, but attachment parenting can be bad when things get tricky. “Where people come unstuck is they fall in love with their first creation and stay with it even when the evidence is against it,” says Bailey.“Holding a sentimental attachment to elements that just aren’t working will do your startup no long-term favours,” Donnelly adds.Do go back to the beginningIf sales or interest in your product aren’t what you had hoped, Bailey suggests going back to page one of your story. “Remember what it was that first motivated you,” he says. “What problem were you trying to solve? You have to be open to trying 10 or 20 different solutions and seeing what works.”For Sahota, the first element was working – his sauces were popular and central to his story – but to satisfy investors and progress as a business, he knew the answer was to make his crisps work. “And we should have made that move a lot sooner,” he says. “But I felt like I couldn’t look beyond the sauces unless I was dead.”Don’t look like an amateurIt doesn’t matter how good your story is if you come up short when talk turns serious. “You’ve got to have that nice soft exterior to connect but when you sit down with the supermarket or an investor, they have to know you mean business,” says Sahota. “You need to be able to say: ‘When you put my product on your shelves, I’ll drive customers in to your store because I’ve got followers who want it and I will add value to the category.’ That is hugely important for retailers.”Do ask the right questionsCustomer research is vital for any new business. “But people always ask their customers: ‘Would you use this product that does this cool thing,’” says Bailey. “But that’s a leading question. They’ll say: ‘Yes’ – and that looks like validation. But you should be asking about experience and behaviour.”Knowing how someone lives will help you to see how your product fits into people’s lives.To do this, Bailey suggests directing people to a landing page on your website and setting up a waiting list long before you launch anything, and then having a conversation with those people on the waiting list. “Even if you just get 10 people, that also means they feel the problem you’re trying to solve. And if nobody signs up, that tells you something, too.”Don’t fall into bad habitsKnowing how to structure each day – and what to do – can be tough for a solo starter, particularly one who has come out of an office environment. “You need to create really good habits straight away,” Sahota says. “There’ll be days when it’s really hard and those habits will get you through even if you’ve run out of willpower or motivation.” The sauce entrepreneur sets himself daily goals. “It could be something really simple like sending one really good email to a potential lead and following it with a phone call. On some days it’s good to set your goals low so you feel like you’ve achieved something.”Do take care of number one“Basically, get enough sleep and you’re halfway there,” Bailey says. “I used to work for a big consultancy, working all hours and travelling, and I hated the lifestyle. When I started my first business I was like: ‘I’m going to take my work-life balance seriously.’ Nonetheless, two years later, an investor turns to me during a crisis and says: ‘Dave, here’s what you’re going to do. You’re going to take a holiday for a week and come back to this fresh.’ It was what I needed.”Now you’re well versed in the major dos and don’ts, it’s time to get down to business.

Anyone who is interested in wildlife will find that exciting and inspiring.”Newly arrived micro-moths include Musotima nitidalis, originally from Australia and New Zealand, which reached Britain in 2009 via the horticultural trade. The moth is now found in several locations in southern England, where its caterpillars feed on ferns such as bracken.Many of the recent pyralid colonists have arrived naturally, probably assisted by climate change, including the beautifully coloured Evergestis limbata, which has settled along the south coast of England.According to Fox, most of the new arrivals are entirely benign although one, the box tree moth, will be unpopular with gardeners for its caterpillars’ habit of devouring the leaves of box hedges.Easy to see native pyralids include the day-flying mint moth, which can be found among garden herbs and the small magpie – a surprisingly large black and white moth. Common migrants include the rush veneer and rusty-dot pearl.The caterpillars of another group of pyralid moth, the china-marks, live in an air-filled bubble of spun leaves, sometimes below the surface of ponds or at the edge of streams.As well as apps and online guides, there is a new guidebook on pyralid moths to help spotters. Mark Tunmore of publisher Atropos said: “New species are being added to the British list with regularity and we want to make sure that people are well equipped to identify these. We expect Moth Night 2018 to add to our knowledge of this group of moths.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54e895ba068d4305981bcf0fc82017327ac003f7/75_83_2838_1703/master/2838.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6de161b90ee621bd1b835ee921fc1df0","title":"studio 54 review new york club","story":"Matt Tyrnauer’s documentary delivers a lively account of how Studio 54 opened its doors to disco music, hedonism and celebrity revellersStudio 54 is the legendary New York club on Eighth Avenue at 54th Street that opened in the late 70s on the site of a disused CBS TV studio. Co-owners Ian Schrager and Steve Rubell cleverly modified its theatrical space, keeping the balcony and lighting rig and levelling the auditorium with the stage. With wild entrepreneurialism and reckless press-baiting, they captured lightning in a bottle and Studio 54 became world famous for its disco music, its hedonism, its exclusive celebrity guest list, its gay party aesthetic at a time when homophobia was rife on the streets outside. But, after a couple of years, the party was over. Rubell and Schrager were arrested for tax evasion and drugs they ratted out competitor club-owners to reduce their own jail time and Rubell was to die of an Aids-related condition in 1989.There was a feature film in 1998 about this called 54, with Mike Myers archly cast as Rubell. Now it is the subject of Matt Tyrnauer’s lively but tactful documentary tribute, centred on sympathetic interviews with the surviving partner, Schrager, now a successful hotelier.Tyrnauer asks Schrager how much it all cost originally, and Schrager cheerfully says it was $400,000. But wait. The club’s “silent” partner Jack Dushey, seated next to him, says it was pretty much double that. Where did they get all that extra money from? wonders Schrager. Where indeed? What sort of business types would be willing to make that kind of cash loan on a New York nightclub, a loan that might have to be serviced without paperwork? That question is delicately left untouched after that. It’s like a PG version of GoodFellas.Well, there are lots of very watchable TV news clips and great war stories. But what of that Studio 54 regular, New York man-about-town Donald J Trump – that feisty up-and-coming deal-maker with whom Rubell and Schrager incidentally shared a lawyer, notorious rottweiler Roy Cohn? Mr Trump is disappointingly not mentioned.An entertaining documentary. Maybe the full story of Studio 54 has yet to be told."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720ef95ea634067a3ed25906009a40ee589bbbe8/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd215f9d2f8ef72fd5263117771226f","title":"how the bbc made their 2018 world cup trailer entirely out of tapestry","story":"It took six months and 600 tapestries to bring to life a trailer inspired by Russian mosaics, Soviet poster art and bus stopsThe story behind the BBC’s remarkable World Cup trailer begins some time ago, with a 12-year-old on a day trip to a boat show becoming entranced by an embroidery machine. Many years later the boy, now working in animation and also the singer and guitarist in a rock band, produced a Kickstarter-funded, Channel 4-backed fully embroidered animated video for one of their songs. It was, he says, “the most ridiculously stupid idea”, one that took seven months to bring to life. Four years later, the BBC called.“That video was such a passion project, totally just doing it for the love of it,” Nicos Livesey says now. “So to be able to take it further on, to be able to do it for such an amazing event and with the whole world watching, for this opportunity to come off the back of something like that was super exciting for me.”The latest chapter in this story was opened last September, when the BBC’s in-house creative agency, BBC Creative, put out a call for World Cup-related ideas. Two members of their team, Edward Usher and Xander Hart, immediately got to work. “The brief was to talk about the global impact the World Cup has and its cultural significance,” says Usher. “It’s a celebration of football, but we wanted to go beyond that. So we started researching Russian history.”The pair came up with 20 proposals, the best of which were among 68 put in front of the BBC Creative’s creative directors, James Cross and Tim Jones, at the end of 2017. There was one based on Russian sculpture, a variety of live-action ideas, and one that proposed to make a film out of tapestries. “Tapestries have been used by different cultures throughout history,” says Hart. “We looked at a lot of Russian art and they had some amazing tapestries and embroidery.”This all seems like considerably more thought than was once given to World Cup title sequences, which for a long time appeared to be little more than hastily patched-together amalgams of slow-motion celebrating footballers and the most obvious host-nation cliches, while trailers scarcely existed at all. But then came 1990, and Nessun Dorma.Italia 90 is viewed as something of a watershed in the history of Britain’s relationship with the tournament and football in general, but the first sign that something unusual was going on came at the end of the first week of the tournament, when Luciano Pavarotti’s rendition of Puccini’s aria, the soundtrack to the BBC’s opening credits and the antithesis of the kind of music generally popular at the time – New Kids on the Block and Adamski were in the top 10 that week – hit the charts. By the second week it was at No 3, and it remained in the top three for the remainder of the tournament.If this was the moment when credits and trailers for sporting events turned from necessity to opportunity, the bar has been raised many times since. Perhaps most notable was Channel 4’s Paralympic campaign in 2012, Meet the Superhumans, and the 2016 sequel, We’re the Superhumans. What we are now enjoying is an arms race between rival broadcasters and their creative teams.“The BBC has a great history of pushing things that are artistic anyway,” says Usher. “I think they should do the same in their marketing campaigns. There’s a lot of faith in BBC Creative to make standout promos. When people are talking about the film, and they’re amazed that it’s embroidered, it’s doing a better job of promoting the World Cup on the BBC. The story of the film as well as the film itself is promoting the offer.”Early this year the pair’s embroidery idea was commissioned. They moved quickly to recruit Livesey, the only person known to have made an animated film out of embroidery (not the craziest medium he’s used: he animated one advert entirely with icing). He did further work on the aesthetic: the character designs are informed by Russian mosaics, the backgrounds by Soviet era poster art, and the tapestry machine that starts and ends the film by a particularly niche subset of Russian architecture. “The machine is a sort of concept embroidery machine,” says Livesey. “I was looking at old Russian bus stops and their amazing concrete geometric shapes, so we created an amazing machine living in space that turns on whenever the World Cup’s on and stitches out its most amazing moments and then sleeps again for another four years.”Gradually a longlist of moments to be immortalised was whittled down. Usher and Hart’s earliest World Cup memories are from 1998, which is why Zinedine Zidane’s headed goals from that year’s final make an appearance (Dennis Bergkamp’s famous wonderstrike against Argentina was one of the moments that did not make the cut), while the inclusion of Iceland’s thunderclaps, coming before the country’s World Cup debut, was a more left field suggestion.“There were many moments that we wanted to try, but we wanted to get some imagery in it that wasn’t just constant goals, goals, goals,” says Livesey. “Iceland’s thunderclaps are such a powerful thing, the image of them charging on their way, parting the seas to Russia. It just seemed a really nice way to get something different in there.”The video was animated on computer, and then each of the 600 frames machine stitched at the London Embroidery Studio over a period of three weeks in April. “They were a bit under the cosh,” says Usher. “I think they had all their machines running 23 hours a day.”Usher and Hart’s other significant task was to find the perfect soundtrack. After an inevitably exhaustive period of research – “We had to trawl through an absolute gamut of Russian music, starting in Gregorian chants up to modern music, everything under the sun,” says Usher – they eventually settled upon a Russian folk song called Ochi Chernye, or Dark Eyes, and recorded a bespoke version at Abbey Road, sung in Russian by Sir John Tomlinson (a very different version of the same tune, by the DJ Sigala, will soundtrack the BBC’s World Cup title sequence). “Nessun Dorma was really made famous by the fact it was on the BBC in 1990, and that was what we wanted to achieve: find our version of that,” says Hart. “We really feel this has the necessary emotion.” The likes of Drake and Dua Lipa can consider themselves warned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fc5a99f79691a8f0a00aaa84dc15d00433244d2/158_54_3177_1906/master/3177.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e5f3f59e48c7e57a3458aef99e2b857","title":"premier league fixtures 2018 19 manchester city start title defence arsenal","story":"Manchester City will start their Premier League title defence at Arsenal. The 2018-19 fixtures, announced on Thursday morning, handed Pep Guardiola’s record-breaking team an Emirates Stadium opener on the weekend of 11-12 August – a fixture that will be Unai Emery’s first competitive match as Arsenal manager.City, who amassed 100 points and 106 goals en route to finishing 19 points clear of Manchester United in 2017-18, do not face another top-six side until the trip to Liverpool in October. Games against the newly promoted trio Wolves, Cardiff and Fulham are part of a sequence that also includes Huddersfield, Newcastle and Brighton – the three teams who came up last year.It is a similar story for Manchester United, who begin at home to Leicester. The 2017-18 runners-up have Tottenham at home in their third game, with Brighton, Burnley, Watford, Wolves, West Ham and Newcastle their other early-season opponents.Liverpool’s start appears more challenging. After hosting West Ham, Jürgen Klopp’s side face Tottenham, Chelsea and Manchester City in a run that also includes Crystal Palace, Brighton, Leicester and Southampton.Tottenham start their second successive campaign at Newcastle before hosting Fulham at Wembley on 18 August. Their new £850m stadium at White Hart Lane will not be ready until the 15 September fixture against Liverpool.Arsenal face a tough first two games without Arsène Wenger.

Fulham, who secured their place in the top flight with victory over Aston Villa in the Championship play-off final, begin at home to Crystal Palace, before the trip to Spurs is followed by Burnley at home and Brighton away. The other first-day fixtures are Southampton v Burnley and Watford v Brighton.Among the final round of matches, scheduled for 12 May, Manchester City are at Brighton – where they started last season – while Cardiff and Wolves are at Manchester United and Liverpool respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27cc823fe6a13e3c35ccdd032aef64d5fdde4e4a/584_300_2205_1323/master/2205.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa0ebc0d90e4eb9c3902c5222b6ce702","title":"sporting lisbon meltdown portugal world cup","story":"“Spoiled kids, let’s resolve this then …” wrote the Sporting president, Bruno de Carvalho, on his personal Facebook account at the start of April. Two months on, after a period in which 19 players have been suspended and a group of hooded men forced their way into the club’s training ground armed with sticks after defeat in the final league match of the season, it’s fair to say things have not worked out quite the way the man some have labelled the “Donald Trump of football” would have planned.While Spain have problems of their own as the Iberian nations prepare to meet in their opening match at the 2018 World Cup, the fallout from the Sporting soap opera has marred the buildup to the tournament for the reigning European champions. On Monday Gelson Martins, William Carvalho and Bruno Fernandes joined the goalkeeper Rui Patrício in cancelling their contracts, citing “valid motives” for their decision. The Netherlands international Bas Dost, who was one of the players injured in the training ground attack, has also indicated his desire to leave one of Portugal’s most famous clubs, even accusing the president of perpetrating of “psychological violence” towards him, with the law courts now set to rule on the case.“It’s a big mess,” admits Nuno Travassos of the Portuguese website maisfutebol.pt. “He was seen as the saviour and even now the club is split in two. There are still many people who support De Carvalho and want him to stay, even after all this controversy. He has always liked to speak about the team’s performances and uses social media a lot. That’s why some of the newspapers have made the comparison with Trump.”Surprisingly elected in March 2013, De Carvalho has proven to be a popular choice among supporters for his frequent attacks on the Portuguese football establishment, including accusing Lisbon rivals Benfica of offering gifts to referees.He has even been known to sit on the bench during matches – “creating a presence” as he described it – and also regularly texted his players after matches to make plain his dissatisfaction with their performances. But despite the controversial appointment of Jorge Jesus as manager after he left Benfica, Sporting’s season unravelled after the 2-0 defeat to Atlético Madrid in the first leg of their Europa League tie that prompted De Carvalho’s Facebook post.Having previously promised to stay away from social media after one outburst in 2015, the president’s accusation that members of his team had committed “grotesque mistakes” understandably did not go down well. Nineteen players subsequently posted their own statement on Facebook noting their “displeasure with the public declarations of our president” – a move that prompted De Carvalho too threaten them with suspension.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the denouement of the season was a disaster as Sporting finished third in the table, failing to qualify for the Champions League, before the damaging defeat to the minnows Aves in the Portuguese Cup final, who have been a top-flight side for only three seasons. Having already complained about fans being allowed access to the private car park at the club’s training ground, the attack on Dost, Jesus and several other members of staff a few days before the final proved to be the final straw.“The environment became awful,” says Travassos. “The players said in their resignation letters that the president and the board are responsible for this situation because they contributed to this bad environment and didn’t assure the security conditions of the team. That’s why they say they have reason to leave.”Patrício, the 30-year-old goalkeeper who has won nearly 70 caps, was the first to tender his request to terminate his contract after a proposed €18m transfer to Wolves was vetoed by De Carvalho at the last minute, while winger Martins and midfielders Carvalho and Fernandes have also been linked with moves to the Premier League in recent days. Whether they get their wish remains to be seen, with De Carvalho having since offered to resign if all the players who want to leave reverse their decision, although Portugal coach Fernando Santos may fear the damage has already been done.“Some of them are experienced players but obviously it’s something that they would have wanted to avoid,” says Travassos. “Usually the only thing we talk about in press conferences is Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo but this time, there is more about Sporting.”But with a squad that contains 13 of the 23 players who helped win the country’s first major silverware at Euro 2016, Portugal supporters have every reason to feel quietly confident of their chances. A comparison with the 1986 World Cup – when a talented squad went home bottom of their group after falling out with the Portuguese FA over bonuses – is tempting, especially given the presence of Morocco, to whom they lost 3-1 in their final match 32 years ago after defeating England, in their group. Yet with top-level players throughout the squad led by Cristiano Ronaldo in what is likely to be his last appearance at a World Cup, Santos’s side will be written off at their peril.“I don’t think this has changed anything among the fans,” says Travassos. “It’s a bad situation of course but expectations are still the same. The players will be focused and if there is a problem, the coach has others to replace them. We don’t have the options of many countries but we have very good quality.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e59f94925efdac94b6f09b14f39052a4955f27da/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=434d226781f148c2b9919449abe8d7b4 1400w","title":"world cup beauty russia vladimir putin","story":"Welcome, once again, to the world. Eight years, $19bn and two terms in the glorious 100-year rule of Vladimir Putin in the making, the 2018 World Cup in Russia is upon us. This has been a fittingly Soviet-scale construction project, taking in eight new superstadiums, thousands of miles of new roads and 53,000 civilian volunteers trained in the arts of pointing, waving and – toughest and most Russian of all – smiling at strangers.As ever the greatest show on earth carries its own irresistible heat before the tournament opener on Thursday afternoon. The World Cup may be compromised by greed and murkiness. Fifa may have become a kind of floating corporate city state, orbiting the globe, planting its great clanking tentacles down among the ripest pastures. But as preparations thrummed up through the gears in Moscow on Wednesday there was a familiar sense of clarity, of that background hum beginning to die away.It is one of football’s mysteries that no matter what its governing bodies throw at this great belching, burping circus, the spectacle at its heart somehow remains pure and impossibly more-ish. There will be the usual moments of beauty and outrage over the next 35 days and 64 matches. On Saturday afternoon Lionel Messi, the greatest footballer of the modern age, will take on an Iceland team managed by a part-time dentist.On Monday the odd-job street footballers of Panama will kick off their first ever World Cup, by the Black Sea. In Rostov the aristocrats of Brazil seek revenge for the humiliation of 2014 and for now the opening exchanges of any World Cup remain a four-yearly Christmas Day, an occasion that resonates with a deeply personal excitement.At which point, the world beyond must also come rushing in. Should Fifa’s simperingly insincere football family be here at all? When Russia’s players walk out to face Saudi Arabia on Thursday they will do so as emissaries of the world’s largest land mass, a nation with a long-standing football culture and with the will to put on a grand show.But still the question of Russia itself remains. There will be no shortage of pop-up Moscow expertise over the next few days, plenty of just-add-water holding forth on the exact scope and meaning of Putin’s sui generis superstate.This is not a criticism of attempts to put this spectacle in context, something everyone from Boris Johnson to Frankie Boyle (from whom this article has already stolen at least one Putin joke) has had a go at.What really stands out is the impossibility of the task, the basic dizzying oddity of Russia and a political system the writer Peter Pomerantsev has described as “a post-modern dictatorship”.A while back Gary Lineker offered a little handy moral relativism, floating the oft-repeated and deeply Russian notion that as there is corruption and murkiness in every country it is hypocritical to censure Russia for doing something similar.While this is true in one sense, it also eliminates at a stroke the question of degree, obscuring in Russia’s case the lack of political opposition – liberal Russians sometimes refer to the system as “a shitocracy” – or the fact Amnesty International has voiced concerns about violence against dissenting voices.Naturally the president was a visible presence in Moscow on the eve of the big kick-off, appearing suddenly on stage at the Fifa congress that would later award the United States, Mexico and Canada the 2026 tournament.As Putin took the microphone the World Cup trophy sat gleaming on its plinth a few yards away, a mirror image of smooth golden otherworldly alpha power. Relaxed as ever, with that strange capacity to fill any room with his presence, Russia’s leader spoke approvingly of Gianni Infantino – and without a false note right up until the moment he described Fifa’s president as “our front man”. Translation issues, no doubt.The view from Moscow is at least a little clearer. The grand beige-hued centre of town has been sandblasted by a two-year facelift project, leaving a spotless face to greet the World Cup’s half a million visitors. On Wednesday night travelling fans could already be seen singing in the central squares as Moscow submitted to World Cup fever like a sombre great-uncle dancing at a wedding.What happens next – if we can, finally, speak of the football – is equally fascinating. Among the favourites to win the World Cup, Brazil and Germany look strong and settled, and Spain strong and unsettled after the outlandish decision to sack their manager Julen Lopetegui on Wednesday morning, punishment for his acceptance of the Real Madrid job after the tournament.France have the greatest depth of talent. Argentina look brittle in defence and dreamily strong in attack, with Messi always capable of simply lifting the tournament by the scruff of the neck and walking away with it.Neutrals will perhaps hope for some new faces in the late stages. Nigeria, Senegal and Egypt carry Africa’s middling hopes of a first semi-finalist. Serbia may spring a shock, while Belgium, most people’s hotly tipped over-underdogs, have a look of England 2006 about them, with dollops of elite talent, a slightly jarring strain of optimism and a manager with a nice suit.Ah yes. England. For once football’s most quietly tortured nation will enter a World Cup with the burden of expectation close to zero. This has brought its own unexpected positivity. With an admirable manager in Gareth Southgate and some fit, likeable young players there has even been a cautious bubbling of optimism around the squad as they set about their drills in sleepy Repino.In the past England have relied on iniduals, on the notion a single burst of running power from some celebrity A-lister may be enough to roar the world into submission. This time they have a grooved system and a team of willing workers. A lack of outstanding players will do for them at some stage. But Southgate deserves credit for the way the tone has been set, for his backing of Raheem Sterling in the face of nonsensical assaults on his character and for the fraternal support offered to Danny Rose over his struggles with depression.And so on with the show. It is an odd side note to Russia 2018 that Putin wanted this World Cup for reasons that now seem a little distant. Ten years ago Russia was keen to engage with the world on positive terms, to signify its coming out as a global player. The temperature has dropped since, to the extent it is debatable Russia would bother bidding now.The greatest hope is the next five weeks, as Fifa flags decked with platitudes about friendship and family and anti-racism are unfurled around the Luzhniki Stadium, is that football may still provide something unexpected, a connection in some enduringly distant corners."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ebe590cc27e37a7493edb0eaba579ed0f813c300/0_351_4590_2753/master/4590.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=06e01d58a6f892412167ecc1083d4c22","title":"world cup 2018 opening ceremony first game live","story":"There are four hours and six minutes to go before live British TV coverage of the World Cup begins.

If I did, I started to feel pain in my back, my joints and my knees. I remember I was getting off my boat in Egypt five months ago – this day is the turning point in my life – and I was walking off on to an island. I had three friends with me and it was 300 yards to the end of the island. The sand was a bit heavy and it was a bit sunny and I said to them: ‘I cannot walk.’ I had to sit for 30 minutes.

However, Rashford’s hopes of featuring against Tunisia appear to be diminishing after missing a second day of training in Russia with a knee complaint.The Football Association indicates it is a precautionary measure and manager Gareth Southgate called it a “slight knock” upon England’s arrival. Rashford also attempted to allay concerns about his fitness on Twitter on Wednesday evening. “Thanks for the messages I’ve been getting,” he posted. “Picked up a slight niggle but nothing to worry about.”It is just about acceptable to talk about the Premier League on the first day of the World Cup, but this is out of order.News just in!

Here’s Saudi Arabia’s Ali Al-Bulaihi on the debt he owes to his mum. “She is the reason for my success and the reason why Ali Al-Bulaihi is the person he is right now.” She’s also the reason why he speaks of himself in the third person, which in general life is to be avoided at all costs but which I find amusing and endearing among sportsmen.And with that, it’s time to hand over the reins to Simon in London, who will take you through to kick-off time in Moscow.

I’d forgotten about Belgium ‘82. In fact, ‘82 was a vintage year. Or maybe I’m just a sucker for the aesthetic of that time.Oh look, here’s Thomas Hitzlsperger, veteran of 52 Germany caps, on his nation’s chances of adding a fifth gold star to their badge. In his first  World Cup column, the former midfielder says recent displays suggest Joachim Löw’s team may have taken their eyes off the ball.On the subject of kits, the World Cup is a poorer place for the absence of the likes of this Sideshow Bob-inspired affair from the A-League’s Mariners:“I know it’s probably blasphemy to say so but I hated the England ‘82 kit when it first came out and haven’t changed my mind 36 years later,” writes lancaster43, who will now be ceremonially burned at the stake. I particularly enjoy the nod to the ‘82 kit in the current “pre-match” shirt (which I think used to be called a training top). Anyway, this from JD Sports’ website:This men’s England Squad Pre-Match Shirt from Nike is the same shirt that’s worn by the team when readying up for a game. In a fresh white colourway, it’s built from innovative Dri-FIT fabric, which wicks away sweat to keep you feeling cool and dry - however tense the game gets. The lightweight jersey features a crew neckline and short sleeves.

But before he does, and while he wends his way to the hotseat, have a look at this from him, on the making of that utterly brilliant BBC World Cup trailer. An incredible 600 (six hundred!) tapestries were made for it.The Saudis are one of seven teams at thisWorld Cup from largely Muslim nations and their game tonight comes during the festival of Ramadan. Fasting during daylight hours is, of course, obligatory during Ramadan, which poses a few problems for the players. The Saudis’ situation has been further complicated by the fact they are based in Saint Petersburg, where summer days are lengthy – there is currently 18 hours of daylight to be precise. Paul MacInnes profiles the teams affected, and how they have found various ways of tackling the issue.Achilles is putting his faith in Russia, but who would he have gone for had he been able to read our experts’ guide to tonight’s teams? Here, Gosha Chernov and Greg Wilcox, part of the ’s international football network, provide a comprehensive lowdown on the two sides:We’ve had Paul the Octopus, Fred the Ferret, Soothsayer Hog, Citta the Elephant, Flopsy the Kangaroo and Madame Shiva the Guinea Pig, to name but a few of the many psychic animals who specialise in predicating sporting results. Now we can add Achilles the Cat to the list. The feline, who resides in Saint Petersburg, is set to tread in some illustrious footsteps by making predictions for the tournament in Russia, although whether he can live up to the standards set by the ground-breaking Paul, who was famously accurate in his predictions at the 2010 World Cup, is yet to be seen. Achilles, who is deaf – allowing him to fully concentrate on his decision, apparently – has tucked into a bowl of food with the Russian flag on it, signalling a win for the host nation against Saudi Arabia tonight.But if you prefer your predictions with a more human touch to them, here our very own soothsayers gaze into their crystal balls and deliver their verdicts:If you’re a quick reader and have about nine minutes spare, this by Ken Bensinger, on how we ended up in Russia for the 2018 World Cup, is a must read.We all have our favourites.

This:Fire alarm update: not sure if it was the smokers round the back of the bike sheds or something else, but there doesn’t seem to be a real fire. Still, that was about as fun as it was expected. Anyway, thanks to the wonders of modern technology, we can carry on, come what may. All of which leads us nicely to a coach who knows a thing or two about firefighting, Russia’s Stanislav Cherchesov.

There are four weeks of this to look forward to now. Plus there’ll be a bit of football, I imagine.Yes, actual football. There will definitely be some later today, when hosts Russia open their campaign against Saudi Arabia at Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. Once the opening ceremony, featuring the aforementioned popster (who has been accused of selling his soul in agreeing to perform), is done and dusted, kick off is 6pm local, 4pm BST, 1am (Friday) AEST or 11am EDT.Some housekeeping before we e head first into it all: this daily blog will run until an hour before the first game of the day kicks off. Then, it’s over to the new, match-specific liveblog(s) to see the day through. And that’s how we’ll roll pretty much every day for the next four weeks.

It was a fun spectacle, put on by the developer, Epic Games, for fans who screamed their support throughout the hour-long contest.The set up was simple. Fifty well-known Fortnite players – young adults who play every night for countless fans on YouTube and Twitch – were teamed up with 50 celebrities from the worlds of wrestling, television and music, with each pair taking part in an all-or-nothing match of the world’s most popular video game. In Fortnite’s famed Battle Royale mode, 100 players land on a giant island and must fight until only one player – or team – is left standing. Usually the prize is simply kudos, but here there was a $3m (£2.2m) pot to aim for, the money to go to charities chosen by the top finishing duos.The competition took place on a vast stage at one end of the Banc of California Stadium. Epic invited around 15,000 fans to attend and they duly queued outside for hours, rewarded for their enthusiasm with free pizza, burgers and hot dogs at concession stands themed to look like in the game’s fictitious franchises. There was even a real-life battle bus – the flying vehicle that delivers characters to the island – hung from a crane in the parking lot.All the game’s most famous players took part including Tyler “Ninja” Blevins, the blue-haired streamer with over 8 million online followers and Fortnite’s superstar player. He was matched with the EDM star Marshmello, a DJ and producer who wore his signature white marshmallow-shaped helmet throughout the competition. Other hot favourites were Kinstar, who was paired with the UFC fighter Sean O’Malley, and Britain’s Ali-A, who was matched with the Fall Out Boy bassist, Pete Wentz.Before the action began, the crowd, gathered on rows of chairs reaching back toward the centre circle, were entertained by a roving camera that projected unsuspecting fans on to two huge screens at the rear of the stage, at which point they were expected to perform one of the signature in-game dances that have now become beloved of sports stars around the world. They did so with gusto. After two exciting warmup matches, with dozens of fast-paced shootouts breaking out in congested areas, the prize competition saw the tactics chane, the teams parachuting out all over the island in an attempt to survive as long as possible rather than engage in immediate conflict. The best builders had the advantage as Ninja, Myth and Muselk all raised vast wooden towers, where they hid away like paranoid medieval monarchs. Other players stayed at the edges of the map until the game’s storm circles came in, forcing everyone together. Suddenly the pace accelerated, with celebrities falling by the dozen as pro players used their lighting-fast construction skills to gain crucial height advantage.The final four players: Kitty Plays, CouRage, Ninja and the last surviving celeb, Marshmello, found themselves trapped along a vast cliff overlooking the island’s Shifty Shafts area. They built neighbouring towers and traded gunfire until finally Ninja and Marshmello, atop the tallest tower of all, took out CouRage to claim victory. And Marshmello did it all without removing his mask.Throughout the whole baking hot affair, the crowd ensured the atmosphere remained exhilarating and good-humoured. “We get to see the best players and some big celebrities,” said Anthony a 15-year-old fan from Glendale, wearing the purple cap that came in goodie bags distributed to every attendee. “No other game has done this kind of event – they’re giving us all this free stuff because they love the community, this is amazing.”So what is the distinct appeal of the game? “There’s something about going up against 99 other players and getting that victory – it’s so much sweeter than every other game,” said George Adams, 20, from LA. “I know H1Z1 and PUBG really started the battle royale genre but Fortnite has taken it to a new level. And Epic is constantly updating – every week there’s some kind of community event, there’s a lot of creativity.”This is only the beginning of Epic’s competitive gaming plans. During the event, the company announced its 2019 Fortnite World Cup, a global competition open to everyone, with $100m in prize money. The online audiences for will be huge.As the stage cleared, Ninja and Marshmello were handed their golden trophy and embraced as the crowd started to drift away. Selfies were taken while parents milled around, arms filled with merchandise. Anthony, on his way out when asked about the Fortnite phenomenon and how the game has amassed 45 million players since its release in September, stopped to consider his answer carefully. “The building element and the costumes make it different from every other game,” he said. “It’s just crazy, it really pops and it’s new every time you play – you’re always going to land in a different spot and find different weapons. “Everybody’s talking about it not just at school, everywhere. It’s taking over the world, man.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd9b0086b181548bd323ca738abff8b831cd9a3b/0_210_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a0aa9bb2d8930295ed85386d22b40d55","title":"how one marine lost his dream job but found meaning helping other veterans","story":"When a freak injury ended marine Nick Fleming’s chances of ever seeing active deployment, he left the services unsure of what to do next. But it wasn’t long before The Royal British Legion answered that question for himNick Fleming had always wanted to be a marine. After joining the service in February 2014, and enduring eight months of gruelling training, he was devastated when his career came to end because of a knee injury. The fact that it happened while on a rugby league pitch, rather than during deployment, added insult to injury. “It was my dream job,” he says. “To have it taken out from under my feet before it even got started was a pretty tough one to take.”The 28-year-old had been posted to Plymouth as part of the Royal Marines’ 42 Commando unit and would spend two years in rehabilitation, undergoing a number of operations to try and repair the damage. Eventually, under his surgeon’s advice, he had to admit defeat and accept that he wouldn’t be able to continue as a Royal Marine . He was medically discharged in October 2017 – only three and a half years after he’d joined the service. “One of the top knee surgeons in the south west said it was time to rethink my career. I potentially could have stayed on as a clerk or in the store, but it’s not really what I joined up to do. So it was decided I’d leave.” For service men and women who leave the forces, adjusting to civilian life can be a challenge. Fleming admits he didn’t really know what he wanted to do after he left the marines. “I had no clear direction,” he says, but decided to move to London to be with his girlfriend. He had come across The Royal British Legion while in rehabilitation, attending the charity’s Battle Back Centre in Lilleshall, which supports sick and injured armed forces personnel. While there, he took part in indoor climbing and golf sessions, and completed a wheelchair basketball coaching qualification. In London, he saw a job advert for an advice and information officer at the Legion’s Pop-In Centre and applied. He now helps others make the same transition as he did, and offers welfare support to the armed forces community as needed. Working in an office has been a real culture change, but he admits he’s found the work really rewarding. “We were able to talk to him, find him accommodation, get him a deposit and kit out the property. We gave him a fresh start and took that worry off him, so he could start getting his life back together.”Many of the charity’s beneficiaries are dealing with mental health issues, often related to their time in the services. Fleming has completed a mental health first aid course with the Legion to help those who come through the centre’s doors. The other common issue is accommodation – particularly in London. Some of the men and women leaving the service won’t have a plan in place for where they’re going to live afterwards and will panic about leaving it to the last minute. The Legion can help with finding somewhere suitable, offering grants for deposits or furnishings, or with filling out benefit forms. Fleming can also signpost beneficiaries to other services, such as counselling and physiotherapy. For him, the most challenging part of his work is learning to deal with the stress and responsibility of other people’s problems. Golf, which he was introduced to at the Battle Back Centre while in rehabilitation, has become an important coping mechanism.“Not only am I coming to terms with losing my career and moving to London, trying to find somewhere to live, all of that stuff, but you’re also picking up other people’s issues, which are constantly going through your mind,” he says. “Golf sounds really boring but if I need to unwind, that’s what I’ll go and do.”To find out more about The Royal British Legion click here "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca454d42ef45a711e0dc3c1492bca8addf238c1/0_220_3600_2161/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53f117e6e9dc739adb20fa6c94c2dce3","title":"making an honest crust consumers routinely conned by food labels","story":"Manufacturers too often make false claims and use deceptive pictures on labels, and regulation should be toughened up, says EU consumer championFood manufacturers are deceiving the public by mislabelling their products as “artisanal” or homemade and implying they are full of healthy whole grains and fruit when they are not, according to a new report.Food labelling needs to be toughened up, says the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) which has published the report. While manufacturers have to put salt, sugar and fat levels on the back of the pack, there is nothing to stop them making false claims and using deceptive pictures on the front.Three areas are singled out in the report called Food Labels: Tricks of the Trade. The report pulls together data from consumer organisations in a number of European countries. While the UK did not submit examples, BEUC says its consumers suffer just as much as anywhere else from misleading labels. Ben Reynolds, deputy chief executive of the charity Sustain in the UK, agreed. “We know that consumers in this country are being conned by phony products, and as a nation getting nowhere near its five a day, exaggerated claims about fruit or veg content are deeply irresponsible,” he said. “Vague marketing terms like ‘artisanal’ and ‘farmhouse’ fool us into thinking we’re buying higher quality products and we’re routinely charged more for the privilege. “This report highlights the need to have a national debate about food labelling before we leave the EU. Brexit represents an opportunity for us to design and enforce our own regulations on food labelling, protect UK consumers and make it easier to make healthy choices.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50438ef15c5ff956fe8301b785ba7bd938bc3c0a/1137_1245_3657_2194/master/3657.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=be59e4f2439e4b92b754f344f606a777","title":"female composers largely ignored by concert line ups","story":"Women in Music project finds that in 1,445 classical concerts across globe only 76 include a work by a womanNew statistics have shown up the “inexcusable” fact that only 76 classical concerts among 1,445 performed across the world from this year to 2019 include at least one piece by a woman. The composer Emily Hall, who called the result of the tot-up inexcusable, said: “All organisations have a responsibility to programme at least one work by a female composer, I just think that should be standard now. I’m always shocked when I go to a concert and they don’t, it seems such a straightforward thing to do ... I’m always amazed, it seems like such a huge oversight.”The soprano Gabriella Di Laccio said she was shocked by the research. “I don’t really understand it, we don’t have excuses any more. The idea that there might not be enough female composers or the music might not be good enough ... this is all in the past.”Campaigners say the old arguments about the canon being overwhelmingly male do not stand up. Di Laccio created the Donne project this year to champion female composers and highlight women whose music often went unrecognised in their lifetime. She said the project had convinced her that there were more than enough female composers in history to get a fairer gender balance at concerts.She thought part of the solution could come from audiences being more questioning about the music orchestras presented. “The whole idea of doing this is not to make people angry but to raise awareness. I hope this will be a gentle wake-up call.”Hall said she was in favour of positive discrimination. “It works, it really does. We need to rebalance the scales.”She recalled encountering lots of “unconscious barriers” in her career and remembered her music education being all about middle-aged men. “It has taken me until now to actually conduct my own music because I had always felt like I shouldn’t be doing that on some subconscious level. We need to make it completely equal for the next generation.”Some organisations have introduced measures to address the issue. The BBC Proms and the Aldeburgh Festival, for example, have pledged a 5050 gender balance in commissions of contemporary composers by 2022.The Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music \u0026amp Dance announced a commitment to female composers, entitled Venus Blazing, which it said it hoped would abolish all-male composer programmes. It said music by women, past and present and across genres, would make up more than half of its concert programmes in 201819.Di Laccio said orchestras should be playing the great works by composers such as Beethoven and Mozart but that did not excuse them from ignoring so many female composers.The project Donne and the independent label Drama Musica gathered the data for the figures from the 2018-19 programmes of 15 large orchestras across the world, including the London Philharmonic Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Los Angeles Philharmonic.The LSO’s managing director, Kathryn McDowell, said the orchestra championed the work of women. “Of the 12 young composers on our programmes this season six are women, and while entry to them is based purely on merit, we have seen a 5050 gender split emerge for the past two years, signalling that the best composers writing in Britain today are just as likely to be women as they are men, which is exactly as it should be.”Timothy Walker, chief executive and artistic director of the LPO, said the orchestra did “not make artistic choices based on issues of gender, religion or ethnicity” but was “strongly committed to supporting female musicians and composers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bb7791018d78dd0ddfb15a71ba421da0fa6b678/0_80_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f32ea09b0c26fd2246f5066ea07d62d7","title":"how russia won the world cup","story":"Princes, prime ministers and presidents were sent to boost bids from competing nations – but Fifa was playing its own game.On 8 June 2010, three days before the kickoff of the World Cup in South Africa, envoys from Russia and England stood outside a meeting room in Johannesburg’s Sandton Convention Centre, nervously waiting to make their pitch to host the 2018 tournament.Their audience: elected representatives of the Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football, or Concacaf. Fifa’s 208 member associations, each governing soccer in their countries, were split between six confederations. Concacaf, with 35 member associations under its umbrella, was one of them, and it, in turn, reported up to Fifa. Its territory stretched from Panama in the south to Canada in the north, and included the US, as well as all of the Caribbean and the sparsely populated South American countries Suriname and Guyana.With the possible exception of Mexico, the confederation’s members were not considered particularly formidable on the soccer pitch – but in the cutthroat field of international soccer politics, Concacaf was a powerhouse.That influence was largely due to Jack Warner, Concacaf’s Trinidadian president. Wiry, with glasses over a deeply lined face, he made a point of reminding people that he was a black man who had risen from abject poverty. He was also a born politician, able to whip all of his confederation’s member nations into a reliably unified voting bloc at Fifa’s annual congresses. That unrivaled discipline gave Concacaf an outsized influence compared with other, larger soccer confederations, which struggled with internal strife and factionalism, splitting their votes, sometimes several ways.It also made Warner, 67 years old at the time, one of the most powerful and feared men in soccer. His position was rarely, if ever, challenged. In exchange for the generous disbursement of money that spilled down through him from the highest reaches of the sport, he expected his member associations to vote exactly as he instructed.Born into grinding poverty in rural Trinidad, Warner had risen to become the third-ranking vice president of Fifa and the longest-serving member of its executive committee, or ExCo, the 24-man body tasked with making Fifa’s most important decisions – including determining where World Cups are held.Anyone bidding for the tournament knew that courting Warner was critical. The ExCo vote on where to host both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups was to be held in Zurich on 2 December 2010, and with just under six months to go, the Concacaf meeting in Johannesburg was viewed as a critical sales opportunity.England was preparing a bid, and was up against a number of competitors. Belgium and the Netherlands had teamed up to make up one rival bid Spain and Portugal another. A host of other countries were battling for the rights to the 2022 World Cup, among them the US, Australia and Qatar. But England’s most formidable adversary for 2018 was without a doubt Russia.Russia had been awarded the 2014 Winter Olympics just 18 months earlier, and had been riding nearly a decade of spectacular economic growth, thanks largely to record prices for oil and other natural resources.The country, and particularly its leader, Vladimir Putin, had been eager to take advantage of that boom to reassert its long-relinquished role as a world power. Winning the right to host the World Cup, watched by hundreds of millions around the world, would undoubtedly be an effective way to help plant that idea, projecting strength and stability. Most critically, it would boost Putin’s image among the Russian people. Losing the vote, for Putin, was unthinkable.Russia’s delegation, led by Alexey Sorokin, the Russian Football Union’s general secretary, presented first. It did not go well. For starters, Russia’s national soccer team had failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup thanks to a humiliating loss the previous November to lowly Slovenia, a country with a population only slightly larger than the Siberian city of Novosibirsk. Russia’s presentation, meanwhile, was embarrassingly marred by a glitchy PowerPoint display that failed three times as Sorokin spoke. By comparison, England’s bid team turned in a dazzling performance.The English press, in a fit of uncharacteristic optimism, hailed the presentation as a sign that England’s chances looked good, and that technical prowess, existing infrastructure and general competency – merit – would win the day. The Russians, however, were playing a different game.Two days after the Concacaf meeting in Johannesburg, Fifa held what it dubbed a “bidding expo”. A sort of commercial trade show for the World Cup itself, the event provided all nine countries competing for the right to host the 2018 and 2022 tournaments the chance to meet delegates from around the world. In particular, it was an opportunity to mingle with nearly every executive committee member.Several hours earlier, the billionaire owner of Chelsea FC, Roman Abramovich, walked into Johannesburg’s Gallagher Convention Centre. He had arrived that day on his private jet, accompanied by Igor Shuvalov, Russia’s first deputy prime minister.A high-school dropout and former auto mechanic and commodities trader whose fortune was made thanks to his staunch support of Boris Yeltsin, Abramovich came to control Sibneft, one of Russia’s largest oil producers. Subsequently, he supported Putin as a candidate to succeed Yeltsin, and was richly rewarded for his loyalty. Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 and moved to London five years later, after selling off many of his Russian holdings. Unlike many oligarchs who left Russia, Abramovich maintained a close relationship with Putin.As a rule, billionaires hate to wait for anything. But once the bidding expo began, the normally shy and retiring Abramovich, wearing a tailored charcoal suit rather than his usual jeans, made an unusually enthusiastic show of good cheer.A smile plastered over his unshaven jaw, he joined a contingent of his countrymen, including the Arsenal star Andrey Arshavin, in the Russian booth, greeting soccer officials from around the world, and mugging for photographs with David Beckham.And finally, when the expo was drawing to a close, Abramovich walked out of the hall alongside Sepp Blatter, the Swiss president of Fifa. With so much attention cast in Beckham’s direction, scarcely anyone even noticed them quietly departing together.Earlier in the day, Blatter had bragged to Fifa’s entire membership about the organisation’s record profits in the four years leading up to 2010. He boasted of Fifa having $1bn in the bank, and grandly pledged to distribute $250,000 to each member association as a bonus, plus $2.5m to each confederation. It was the kind of naked patronage that had earned him the adoration of many of Fifa’s 208 members – a larger assembly than that of the United Nations.As he announced in a press conference after the congress concluded, Blatter was planning to run for a fourth consecutive term as Fifa president. “We shall work for the next generation,” he said, intentionally paraphrasing Winston Churchill.After a dozen years in office, and 17 years before that as general secretary, Blatter had grown acutely aware of the cost of maintaining power in an organisation as wealthy, erse and cutthroat as Fifa. More than anyone, he had mastered the darker arts of administering the world’s most popular sport, and had a hand in many of its most Machiavellian deals and accommodations over the years.Engrossed in hushed conversation, the unusually jocular Russian billionaire and the balding, diminutive Fifa president rode an escalator up to the convention centre’s second floor. They then slipped into a private meeting room and quietly closed the door.For those running England 2018, as the bid was officially called, it was evident that winning the right to host was going to depend on more than just the quality of each country’s stadiums, airports and football. In order to gather intelligence on the competing bids, the iniduals and companies supporting England’s bid had hired a former spy who had spent several years undercover in Moscow in the early 1990s, and then taken up a senior post on the Russia desk at MI6 headquarters in London. His name was Christopher Steele.His task, he said, was to help England 2018 “better understand what they were up against, and what they were up against was a completely alien way of doing business”. In the spring of 2010, not long after sources began saying that Putin had suddenly taken a strong personal interest in the bid, Steele began hearing a string of curious and troubling rumours.In April, Russia’s deputy prime minister, Igor Sechin, went to Qatar to discuss a massive natural gas extraction project. That same month, Russia’s World Cup bid team also travelled there. One of Steele’s best sources said the timing was no coincidence, and that on top of massive gas deals, the emissaries were colluding to swap World Cup votes. Russia, the theory went, would pledge its ExCo member’s vote for 2022 to Qatar, and Qatar would promise that, in exchange, its ExCo member would pick Russia for 2018.Other sources, meanwhile, began whispering that Russian bid officials had taken valuable paintings from the Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg and offered them to ExCo members in exchange for votes.When Steele reported his findings, members of the bid team were predictably alarmed. England was doomed, Steele felt certain it was never going to beat a country like Russia, which was clearly prepared to do anything to avoid a humiliating defeat on the world stage. But the former spy then had a second thought. The information he had been developing on Russia and Fifa was highly specific, but also unique and potentially valuable – perhaps extremely so. It would be a shame to see it go to waste. And it just so happened that Steele could think of another potential client for that information: the FBI.A thin crust of icy snow coated the grounds of Fifa’s Zurich headquarters early on 2 December 2010, as members of the executive committee arrived to cast perhaps the most important votes in soccer history. Without stopping, they glided past security in black chauffeur-driven Mercedes S-Class sedans, then down a long ramp leading directly into the bowels of the building.There they alighted on the third subfloor without ever having to step outside or be observed by the crowds of journalists who had been gathering at the entrance since before dawn. The building, known in soccer circles as Fifa House, was an imposing symbol of what the once humble sports governing body had become.Designed by a noted Swiss architect and costing more than $200m, the building, opened in 2007, presented a cold, inscrutable facade of shiny glass covered by steel mesh, set so far back from perimeter fences and guard posts that it could not be seen from the street.Sometimes called an “underground skyscraper,” five of Fifa House’s eight floors were subterranean, and the building’s grand lobby, redolent in contrasting polished and rough-hewn stone, was quietly decorated with expensively discreet flowers. The aesthetic was rigorously Swiss, with almost no adornment anywhere, but it was clear that no expense had been spared.The beating heart of both building and institution was found on the third sublevel. There sat the executive boardroom, where Fifa’s ExCo made soccer’s most critical decisions. It was a room within a room – a dark, impenetrable war chamber ripped from some cold war political drama, with tall, curved walls sheathed in hammered aluminum and floors of polished lapis lazuli. Black-stained oak desks were arrayed in a large square beneath a massive crystal chandelier in the oval form of a stadium bowl.No sunlight was allowed to penetrate the enclosure, Blatter explained on occasion of the building’s opening, because “places where people make decisions should contain only indirect light”.At the turn of the 20th century, the soaring popularity of the relatively new sport of soccer led to demand for matches between clubs from different nations. But the way the sport was played varied enormously from place to place, and the need for a single organising body that could ensure fair matches between countries grew increasingly apparent.Britain’s four national soccer associations, which viewed themselves as the sport’s inventors and greatest practitioners, were uninterested in submitting to a higher authority. England’s Football Association, then already 40 years old, was particularly sceptical, writing dourly that it “cannot see the advantages of such a federation”, and refusing to have anything to do with it.Undaunted, seven continental groups – representing France, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland – met in the back room of a Parisian sports club on 21 May 1904, and decided to organise without the Brits.They called their nonprofit organisation the Fédération Internationale de Football Association, and by joining, the pioneering officials pledged to adhere exclusively to its statutes, giving it supreme authority over the sport. Everyone was to play the game by the same set of rules. Perhaps most importantly, Fifa would demand absolute allegiance from its members, and the complete exclusion of any soccer associations that did not prove to be faithful members of the club.Within a few months, Germany agreed to pay the annual membership fee of 50 French francs, and before long England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all joined, too. South Africa became the first non-European member, affiliating in 1909 Argentina and Chile joined in 1912 and the US entered the fold the following year.In 1928, under pressure from its members to create a tournament that would rival the popularity of soccer at the Olympics, while also admitting professional players – which the International Olympic Committee did not –Fifa announced plans for the first World Cup.Five countries submitted bids to host. But Uruguay’s soccer association, which had won gold medals in the 1924 and 1928 Olympics, offered to cover the travel costs of visiting teams, to build a huge new stadium at its own expense, and to share any profits with Fifa, while absorbing all the risk of a financial loss by itself.“These arguments,” Fifa later noted, “were decisive.” Unwilling or unable to make such financial commitments, the other countries dropped their bids, and 13 nations ultimately competed in the first World Cup, which was an instant hit. On 30 July 1930, nearly 70,000 fans filled Montevideo’s brand-new Estadio Centenario to watch Uruguay defeat Argentina 4–2 in the final.The event’s surging popularity did not, however, net substantial financial gains for many years. For its first several decades, Fifa persisted largely thanks to fees paid by its members, plus small commissions charged on ticket sales at international matches. It gave away, free of charge, the broadcast rights to its first televised World Cup, held in Switzerland in 1954, and even at the 1974 World Cup in West Germany, the majority of tournament revenue still came from ticket sales.That rapidly changed with the advent of modern communications and advertising, and soon television and sponsorship deals far outstripped gate income. Because such a large share of Fifa’s revenue began to derive from the World Cup, the nonprofit opted to measure its finances in four-year cycles concluding with the championship tournament.The cycle ending with the 1974 World Cup netted a tidy profit of just under $20m. For the 2007–2010 period culminating in South Africa, Fifa booked a record profit of $631m, and Fifa’s cash reserves reached nearly $1.3bn. The World Cup had become the largest and most lucrative sporting event in history.When in Zurich, FIFA ExCo members stayed at the Baur au Lac, a 165-year-old monument to the very Swiss aesthetic of expensive understatement. The hotel, on the banks of Lake Zurich, prides itself on absolute discretion, but does admit to having put up, among others, Haile Selassie, Empress Elisabeth of Austria and Kaiser Wilhelm II.During Fifa meetings, the men controlling world soccer could often be found sprawled on overstuffed couches in the Baur au Lac’s lounge, in suits, thawbs and robes, gossiping about the sport’s recondite politics over pricey cocktails and elaborate tea services on silver trays.Just weeks before the December 2010 World Cup vote, two ExCo members, Nigerian Amos Adamu and Tahitian Reynald Temarii, had been suspended by Fifa’s ethics committee following an undercover sting operation by the Sunday Times, which caught them on tape offering to sell their votes in exchange for six- and seven-figure bribes. Blatter called it “a sad day for football”.The committee’s remaining 22 constituents were a colorful if motley group that included a number of former professional soccer players, a medical doctor, a hardware store owner, executives of airlines and oil companies, a champion middle-distance runner, several professional politicians, a handful of lawyers and at least two billionaires.On the eve of the vote, the nine nations making World Cup bids had staked out the Baur au Lac to make one last lobbying push, bringing in as much firepower as they could muster to sway the ExCo members their way.Australia, vying for 2022, had dispatched supermodel Elle Macpherson to Zurich, along with the billionaire chairman of its soccer federation, shopping mall developer Frank Lowy. The US delegation included national team star Landon Donovan, actor Morgan Freeman, sitting attorney general Eric Holder and former president Bill Clinton.England, the odds-on favourite for 2018, had been humiliated several days earlier by the airing of a BBC documentary accusing three Fifa ExCo members of taking millions of dollars in bribes from the sports marketing firm International Sport and Leisure. The report also claimed that Jack Warner had attempted to scalp tickets worth more than $80,000 at the 2010 World Cup.Terrified of the thin-skinned Fifa officials’ wrath, England’s bid team had tried to get the BBC to delay broadcast of the report, which had been produced by investigative journalist Andrew Jennings. When that was unsuccessful, representatives of the English bid resorted to insults, calling the report “unpatriotic” and “an embarrassment”.Despite growing signs that the odds were stacked against it, England had rented two suites at the Baur au Lac and flown in its “Three Lions”– prime minister David Cameron, Prince William and David Beckham – to make a final appeal. Then, in a bit of encouraging news for the English delegation, word came that Vladimir Putin would not be coming to Zurich for the vote. The Russian leader noted he was staying away because, he told the press, ExCo members should “make their decision in peace and without any outside pressure”.For their part, members of England’s bid had lurked in the Baur au Lac until well after midnight, buying ExCo members glasses of aged single-malt whisky and desperately attempting to cut last-minute deals to push their effort across the victory line. Before turning in, Jack Warner had effusively embraced Prince William – a sure sign, it seemed, that he’d send his vote England’s way.Shortly before going to bed in his immaculate residence on a secluded street in an upmarket Zurich neighbourhood, Blatter received a phone call from Barack Obama.He had met the president in the Oval Office during a four-day visit to Washington DC the previous year, and couldn’t help but feel a surge of excitement when he heard his voice on the line. The call was short and formal, lasting only a few minutes.Blatter had publicly expressed support for the US bid on numerous occasions, pointing to the vast commercial opportunities that such an event would provide. Speaking in heavily accented but precise English, he reiterated that position on the phone, deliberately noting that he had only one vote and could not tell other ExCo members what to do.“How are our chances?” Obama asked.Blatter paused and softly sighed. “Mr President, it will be difficult.”“I am a happy president,” said Blatter, looking not particularly happy as he announced that Russia and Qatar had won, and would be hosting the World Cup tournaments in 2018 and 2022 respectively.He stood at the podium before a huge crowd and grimaced. The hundreds of journalists on hand to witness the result of that morning’s vote rushed to file accounts of the Russian delegation, including Roman Abramovich, high-fiving and whooping as Blatter handed deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov the World Cup trophy onstage. Minutes later, Qatar’s royal family followed suit, embracing one another, close to tears.Chuck Blazer, America’s highest-ranking soccer official, wearing a dark suit and one of his trademark colorful ties, was sitting in the auditorium’s front row, which had been reserved for the ExCo. Squeezed between Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar and Nicolás Leoz of Paraguay, he did not join in the cheering, and rose only to briefly embrace the suddenly exultant Qatari beside him, before slumping back into the chair.Directly behind him, Bill Clinton whispered with Sunil Gulati, president of the US Soccer Federation, then rose to shake hands with the politicians and royals in the room. Blazer remained motionless, staring stonily ahead. He had voted for Russia rather than England to host the 2018 World Cup, but later admitted he had been shocked when the US did not win the 2022 bid.Just a few hours later, Vladimir Putin touched down in Zurich, exultant. At a hastily assembled press conference, he thanked Blatter and insisted that Russia would be ready by 2018, and that he hoped Abramovich, who he said was “wallowing in money,” would chip in for some of the stadium construction.“Would it be fair to say,” one excited journalist fawned, “that you are the cleverest prime minister in the world by staying away and winning the contest from so many thousands of miles away?”“Thank you,” Putin said, replying in Russian and smiling. “I’m glad I insisted on giving you the floor. Thank you, it’s very nice to hear this.”Soccer fans in Australia, Korea, Japan, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Holland, all of whom had come up empty-handed, bemoaned the vote and questioned its fairness.Commentators in the press questioned how it could be possible that the two countries least suited to host the World Cup had won, pointing to the inhospitable climatic conditions of Qatar, where daytime temperatures in June and July, when the World Cup was always held, routinely surpassed 40C.But nowhere was it taken harder than in England, where the vote dominated headlines for weeks, and all conversation on the topic was reduced to agonised soul-searching, finger-pointing and anguished gnashing of teeth. Despite all its efforts, the country had humiliatingly garnered only two votes – from its own representative on the ExCo and from Cameroon’s Issa Hayatou – to host the 2018 tournament.British prime minister David Cameron, who had flown back to London on pressing business earlier that day, first heard the news from an advisor sharing the back seat of his bulletproof Jaguar on the way to Downing Street from Heathrow airport. The two men slumped in their seats.“We did our best,” Cameron finally said, before lapsing into stunned silence.One member of England’s bid team cornered Jack Warner and asked him why he had promised his vote and then voted otherwise. The Trinidadian hissed his reply: “Who is going to stop us?”Another member of that team, riding in a shuttle back to central Zurich from the auditorium where the results had been announced, noticed Fifa’s general secretary, the tall and handsome French lawyer Jérôme Valcke, burying his face in his hands, and muttering to himself.“This,” Valcke kept saying, “is the end of Fifa.”This is an edited extract from Red Card: FIFA and the Fall of the Most Powerful Men in Sports by Ken Bensinger, published by Profile.

A further 15, also defying the party whip, voted against.Smith, the now former shadow Cabinet Office minister who had backed remain in the referendum and held her leave-voting Crewe and Nantwich seat by a majority of just 48 in last year’s election, said her first duty was to her constituents.She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that staying in the EEA would not be in their interest, and she refused to accept that if she thought Brexit was a mistake she should say so.“I think a bad idea is giving people a choice and then telling them they’re wrong. I think that is against democracy ... and we need to understand the reasons why people voted in the way that they do. And, no, I’m not then telling people that voted to leave that they’re wrong. It’s my job to understand why they voted to leave and fight to make their lives better.”In a week at Westminster that has been dominated by the sense that the Brexit debate and the UK’s future relations with the EU are approaching a crisis, many Labour MPs were frustrated at the frontbench attempt to fudge away party differences.The shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, had said on Monday that the party was too ided to pursue the so-called Norway option of EEA membership.But rebelling on the bill for the first time on Wednesday, the former shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons cross-party Brexit committee, said there came a point where “we have to stand up and be counted”.He said that remaining in the EEA, which would include membership of the single market, was not a perfect solution but it was better than all the others. Pointing out that the other options proposed by the government and by Labour were only untested proposals, Benn said the EEA was an established alternative to EU membership.“It has the one great advantage – it at least looks like a lifeboat. And the closer we get to October, the less inviting the cold sea appears.”In addition to Smith’s departure, five parliamentary aides resigned from the shadow cabinet before the vote: the parliamentary private secretaries Ged Killen, Ellie Reeves, Tonia Antoniazzi, Anna McMorrin and Rosie Duffield.  Duffield – who won the seat of Canterbury in 2017’s most shocking result – resigned in order to back EEA membership.But whips were relieved that there were not more rebels. A week ago reports of as many as 120 were being touted, while the New Statesman reported that the leading Labour remainer Chuka Umunna was talking openly of starting a new party, Back Together. One rebel claimed the result suggested that there would be a majority for an EEA-type amendment to either the trade bill or the customs bill, both of which will be back in the Commons in the next few weeks. With three Tory MPs voting for the EEA amendment and eight abstaining, there is already a core of Conservative dissidents and a customs union amendment is gathering cross-party support.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, anticipating the revolt, admitted in a speech on Wednesday morning that the party was walking a tightrope. “We campaigned for remain but many of our MPs, including myself, now represent seats which voted heavily leave,” he said. “We are trying to construct at the moment a traditional British compromise and we are trying to drag as many with us as possible both in government and elsewhere around some key elements of that compromise.”Caroline Flint, a Labour remainer whose Don Valley constituency voted more than two to one to leave, defended her constituents, who she said had been insulted “day in and day out by some of the comments in this place and outside” stressing that they “are not against all migration”.Flint said she could not support EEA membership because it would mean there would be no restriction on free movement.She said her constituents “want to have a sense that we can turn the tap on and off when we choose. But also they want us to answer the question, why hasn’t Britain got the workforce it needs, why has social mobility stopped, why do we train fewer doctors than Holland or Ireland and why are these jobs dominated by those in the middle and upper classes so my constituents don’t get a look in?”But the former Europe minister Pat McFadden said it would be “unwise and rash” to take the EEA, the one viable alternative to a Tory deal on Brexit, or no deal at all, off the table. Backing the Lords amendment, he said: “We need to address working-class discontent but we do not take the first step to doing that by making the country poorer, to not get the wealth for public services, for housing, and for the better chance in life our working classes deserve.”The former shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, who chairs the home affairs select committee, said she would obey the party whip and not vote for membership of the EEA only because she wanted to try to build consensus.Cooper and Benn had introduced an amendment calling for EEA membership “with safeguards”. She said her committee had heard evidence about the measures other EU member states were applying to introduce some control over migration, which she had been told could allow the UK to have full single market access without complete free movement. A spokesman for Corbyn said: “The Labour party respects the outcome of the EU referendum and does not support the EEA or Norway model as it is not the right option for Britain.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/adf97727faa060268ce134b7343b21aecede59d8/186_0_1667_1000/master/1667.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3faaf0732dc72b9e0f95f8249c2ca060","title":"mars storm nasa rover opportunity","story":"Experts have no idea what the landscape, or the Opportunity, will look like after storm raging across a quarter of the planet Nasa’s Mars rover Opportunity has been knocked out by a gigantic dust storm that is enveloping the red planet and blotting out the sun.Officials said on Wednesday they were hopeful the rover would survive the storm, which already covers a quarter of Mars and is expected to encircle the planet in another few days. It could be weeks, or even months, until the sky clears enough for sunlight to reach the surface and recharge Opportunity’s batteries through its solar panels.For now, Mars’ oldest working rover is stuck in the middle of the raging storm, in round-the-clock darkness.“By no means are we out of the woods here,” said John Callas, the Opportunity project manager at Nasa’s jet propulsion laboratory in Pasadena, California. “This storm is threatening, and we don’t know how long it will last, and we don’t know what the environment will be like once it clears.”Flight controllers tried late on Tuesday night to contact Opportunity, but the rover did not respond. The storm has been growing since the end of May with unprecedented speed.Nasa launched the twin rovers Opportunity and Spirit in 2003 to study Martian rocks and soil. They landed in 2004. Spirit hasn’t worked for several years. Opportunity, however, has kept exploring well past its expected mission lifetime.Scientists are not concerned about the newer, nuclear-powered Curiosity rover, which is on the other side of Mars where skies are beginning to darken.Dust storms, which occur from time to time on Mars, send dust tens of kilometres into the atmosphere and turn day into night. Spacecraft orbiting Mars are too high to be affected.The Opportunity is unlikely to be buried or get a wheel stuck in dust. Even in the worst of storms, only a layer of fine dust is left behind. Managers said the main concern is that dust could temporarily cover its optical instruments.The rover’s batteries are likely so low that only a clock is still working, to wake the spacecraft for periodic power-level checks, according to officials. If the clock also goes offline, then the rover won’t know what time it is when it comes back on and could send back signals at any time.This isn’t Opportunity’s first major brush with dust.In 2007, a massive dust storm kept Opportunity silent for a few days. It jumped back into action after awakening from its deep self-protecting slumber.This time, the rover’s energy level is believed to be much lower. However, Martian summertime is approaching, which should keep temperatures up at night and prevent the batteries and other parts freezing. Besides electrical heaters, Opportunity is equipped with eight tiny plutonium-powered heaters.Scientists are eager to learn as much as they can about the dust storm to hone their weather forecasting skills. Astronauts living on Mars, for instance, would struggle if caught outside in a fierce dust storm, where winds can reach 113kph (70mph). Opportunity was in remarkably good health going into the storm, Callas said, with only an arthritic joint in its robotic arm. “Keep in mind, we’re talking about a rover that’s been working at Mars, hanging in there, for 15 years and designed just for 90 days,” said Jim Watzin, director of Nasa’s Mars exploration program. “It just doesn’t get any better than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b5b1de1244078b8abd02eb290c2240ff0402424/152_198_2842_1705/master/2842.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f99535a3184d43728dc5e652a85cd5c2","title":"australia handshakes sandpaper darren lehmann england","story":"Australia pushed England hard while their former coach’s sensitivity was exposed by an investment company’s giveawayAccording to PJ O’Rourke, it’s best to affect a limp handshake. “A firm, hearty handshake gives a good first impression,” he wrote, “and you’ll never be forgiven if you don’t live up to it.” There were a lot of hearty handshakes at the start of this latest one-day series between England and Australia, a gamut of clasps, claps, pats, pumps and bumps. Before the start of play the Australians shook hands with the umpires and then the Australians shook hands with each other, then the umpires shook hands with the English, then the English shook hands with the Australians. It was, O’Rourke might say, a lot to live up to.The handshakes were Australia’s idea. “It’s something we want to bring in to start a series, not before every game,” Tim Paine explained, shrewd not to overdo it. This Australia one-day team seem unusually injury prone – they have already lost their four best fast bowlers to various strains and sprains – and it seems wise to minimise the potential for repetitive strain injuries. The last thing they need now is a case of politician’s wrist. Alex Salmond shook so many hands during Scotland’s independence referendum that he had to spend weeks wearing a foam support.O’Rourke also warned that “a firm, hearty shake inspires confidence in others” and “people who go around inspiring confidence in others are probably trying to sell them something”. Quite. Australians are selling the idea that they have reformed. Paine says they want to start “living our actions”. He recently revealed that the senior players spoke about changing their behaviour back when Steve Smith was captain but never actually did anything about it. The handshakes are supposed show that they have changed their ways.The Australians were awfully worried about how much stick they were going to get from the English crowds. “We think it’s going to be pretty full-on,” Paine said before the game. It wasn’t. Here at the Oval at least, there was barely a peep or squeak of abuse. The only time the crowd broke out into anything other than a burble was when Paine sprinted 30 yards from the stumps to claim a top-edge hit by Jos Buttler and then spilled the catch as he fell to earth. Otherwise it was just that familiar old thrum, the applause of fans, the idle chatter of old friends.Some wiseacre investment company tried to stoke it up by handing out squares of sandpaper outside the ground. The stewards took them off the fans as they came in. But a couple of former Australia players got upset about it anyway. Darren Lehmann had a dig at the English broadcaster Alison Mitchell just for mentioning it on Twitter. “You’re better than that,” Lehmann told her. Odd to see Australia’s former coach staking out the moral high ground since it wasn’t so very long ago he said he hoped the Australian public would “give it to” Stuart Broad so hard during the Ashes that “he cries and goes home”.Lehmann has a new job coaching Australia’s national performance squad these days. The man who said he was “ultimately responsible for the culture of the team” who committed ball tampering is now “ultimately responsible” for mentoring Australia’s next generation of players. No doubt he will be just as strict with their behaviour as he is quick to police the tweets sent by cricket journalists on the other side of the world.Unlike Lehmann, this new Australia team at least seem like they are ready to take the rough with the smooth, to accept that their abrasive style of play rubbed some people up the wrong way. Those who know him say Paine is a good man, the right sort to straighten out the team. Whether he is a good enough batsman to be captain, though, is another question. He had a rough day of it here. His dismissal, hitting a neat reverse sweep straight to short third man, was one of the worst in a series of poor shots by the top-order. And it came after he had promoted himself above Glenn Maxwell, too.Australia’s 214 was the lowest all-out total they have ever made in a one-day game in England after winning the toss and batting first. At that point the crowd’s refusal to bait them seemed like an act of mercy. But then England made a mess of the chase.It was to Australia’s credit that they rallied and pushed England as hard as they did. Right now they at least look like what they are, the fifth-best one-day team in the world. It is not much but still more than England, who are supposed to be the No 1, can say for themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40d5117a268c0ec5178f5d9ed1cc76815fbdcbdc/0_380_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d5584ecbe541e1982f62f47e1709ace","title":"parklife britains green spaces in urban places","story":"Spending time outdoors in nature has a hugely positive effect on our wellbeing, but you don’t have to live in a rural area to experience the benefits. Kevin Rushby shares some of his favourite city parks, heaths, wetlands and gardens The only British city to ever win the European Green Capital award (for 2015), Bristol is an urban park-lover’s paradise. Close to the centre is Castle Park, a garden with ruins that is linked across the river by the elegant Castle footbridge. There’s a good five-mile walk to be had along the river, linking gardens and the docks, including Brandon Hill Park. Climb the 30-metre-tall (105ft) Cabot Tower for a fine city view. Scattered all around the city are some great parks worthy of cycle adventures. To the south there is Victoria Park, presided over by the colourful terraced houses of St Luke’s Crescent. Nearby, a real gem is Arnos Vale Victorian cemetery, 18 hectares (45 acres) of greenery where, with luck, you can spot woodpeckers, deer and even slow worms basking on tombstones.Arriving at Glasgow Central, you might be forgiven for wondering where all the green spaces might be, given the extent to which the city’s formidable architecture dominates. Dotted around, however, are some magnificent spots: a top place to go is Kelvingrove, a park with everything for a day out – cafes (try An Clachan), a brilliant museum, monuments, and fountains (the Stewart is a good meeting point). Heading east, check out the Necropolis, last resting place of Victorian grandees. Southwards, the gem is Pollok country park, a lovely day out, even though the unparalleled Burrell Collection is currently closed (till 2020). In the west are the Botanic Gardens, with their fascinating hothouse collection.Given London property prices, you might reasonably expect the city’s green spaces to shrink, not grow. But there have been recent additions, notably Walthamstow Wetlands, a huge area of lakes with 13 miles of trails just a few minutes’ walk from Tottenham Hale station. There is great birdwatching, fishing, cycling and a decent cafe, the Engine House. Also new are the Woodberry Wetlands, a green space that had existed since 1833, but only opened to the public in 2013. Right beside Finsbury Park, it is a good inner-city birding site: you can spot red kites and even marsh harriers. Not exactly new, but renewed, is Burgess Park off the Old Kent Road in Southwark, which recently had an £8m facelift, introducing a bigger lake, new bridge and play areas. Downriver from Greenwich, there are fascinating brownfield parks.The Black Country, if you didn’t know, is actually green: Birmingham has hundreds of parks, many of them vast. Kingfisher country park, for example, runs for 11km along the river Cole, while Cannon Hill Park covers around 100 hectares (250 acres). Within that space you have lakes, tennis, golf, playgrounds, running trails and tearooms – this place really can do a full family day out. If you believe that any great park must be in search of a stately home, then try Aston Park – it has a magnificent Jacobean palace. All the above, however, are dwarfed by Sutton Park, a 970-hectare (2,400-acre) national nature reserve six miles north of the centre, which boasts 22 species of butterfly, plus a few rarities. Look out for the startling Camberwell Beauty – unseen since 1996.Holyrood Park certainly has the size (263 hectares650 acres) and the eye-catching eminence of Arthur’s Seat, but this former royal hunting park also leads through to the less well-known Dr Neil’s Garden, a lovely area created by two local GPs who used caravan holidays in Europe as plant-hunting expeditions. Other off-the-beaten track green spaces in Edinburgh include the Archivists’ Garden, one of several small city gardens tucked away from the busy streets. Also check out Dunbar’s Close, a 17th-century garden, and the roof garden at the National Museum of Scotland. About a mile north from the centre is Inverleith Park, which neighbours the magnificent Royal Botanic Garden.Few cities can boast a green space like Cardiff’s Bute Park, a vast expanse of woodland, grass, trails and playgrounds close to the city centre. Its true magic, however, is that it connects, all along the banks of the river Taff, to several other parks: across the Millennium footbridge check out Sophia Gardens – home to Glamorgan Cricket Club, plus cycle hire, horse-riding centre and cafes – then various meadows, parks and gardens all the way north to the M4. Forest Farm country park is worth a visit: the footpath along the old Glamorganshire canal is rich in birdlife, including kingfishers. Also right in the heart of the city is another, much smaller, green space: the Victorian roof garden on top of the Bute Tower in Cardiff Castle.Green may not be the first colour that pops into your mind when thinking of Liverpool, but the city is blessed with great parks. Stanley Park, a classic Victorian creation, separates the Reds and the Blues – the two football grounds of Anfield and Goodison Park. There’s a good cafe in the Isla Gladstone conservatory, plus fishing lake, playground and a red sandstone wall that inspired the Redwall series of children’s books by Brian Jacques. On the other side of the city, check out Sefton Park and Calderstones. From the latter you could walk the mile to another green space: St Peter’s church, Woolton, scene of arguably the most important musical moment in the 20th century: the first public performance by Lennon and McCartney. Also in this quiet churchyard is the gravestone that inspired the Beatles’ Eleanor Rigby."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bb25f0e31c19f3035548a0eba3c3eb39aa392bd/198_115_2701_1621/master/2701.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1ecd54b7b924192abd71310b20223591","title":"the secret lives of baba segis wives review arcola london","story":"Arcola, LondonFemi Elufowoju Jr directs an arresting version of Lola Shoneyin’s novel about marital power-play and sexual envy“Sir, you will deposit your sperm inside,” a hospital nurse instructs Baba Segi as she hands him a beaker. He – a polygamist and paradigm of chauvinistic braggadocio – insists he does not need a fertility test and that it is his fourth wife who needs to be examined, for “barrenness”.He is told to leave his deposit in the container anyway, and with that begins a masturbation scene of such epic and eye-wateringly Rabelaisian proportions that it becomes the definitive show-stopping moment in a production filled to the brim with sexual swagger and sensational daring.Based on Lola Shoneyin’s bestselling 2011 novel, the play is set in an enclave of modern-day Nigeria where tribal custom and witchcraft still rub up against rationality and science. Ostensibly about polygamy in old Africa, it is a far more universal story of the shifting power-play inside a marriage and sexual envy between women. When the youngest and most educated wife, Bolanle (Marcy Dolapo Oni), enters the scene, the other three plot murderous schemes against her, like Macbeth’s witches. This adaptation by the award-winning writer Rotimi Babatunde captures the complicated gender dynamics: his rampant misogyny, their occasional misandry, and the quiet, subversive power they wield inside his household.The director, Femi Elufowoju Jr, recently staged a live reading of Chinua Achebe’s Things Fall Apart, prizing out the text’s satire and treating the misogynistic characters with an arch, ironic humour. He does the same here, mercilessly sending up Baba Segi (Patrice Naiambana) as a crude buffoon.What makes the production so bold is its unabashedly physical treatment of sex: the wives are spotlit in flagrante, grinding themselves on their lovers in a state of ecstasy. But there are bedroom scenes in which Baba Segi is brutishly thrusting legs apart and pawing at pained bodies, and in these moments, the ribald humour plunges into sudden savagery. One scene dramatises Bolanle’s rape at the age of 15 before flipping back to comedy the same switch follows a child’s sudden death. The shifts from lightness to dark and back again give the performance a dangerous and unpredictable undercurrent.The staging is stripped back yet inventive, with the lighting and choreography creating their own visual poetry: figures crouched on the floor morph into swaying wheatfields women swathed in red become the giant, gyrating backside of a sexy street-seller in a lesbian fantasy characters in an imaginary car begin dancing jauntily to its movements, as if in a Dick Van Dyke musical.The play’s energy never dips and the actors, doubling up repeatedly in their roles, give nuanced, charismatic performances. The effect is nothing short of spectacular."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2404420d866665b1942db16f281177773a2a0964/0_80_3429_2058/master/3429.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b96ec3969d9d6678d514251589202a2b","title":"eu member states block uks access to galileo satellite programme after brexit","story":"Fears over impact on Brexit talks with UK taxpayers having already contributed £1bn A fresh row over the UK’s involvement with the Galileo satellite programme, to which the country’s taxpayers have already paid £1bn, threatens to poison the Brexit talks after the EU shut Britain out of the project.A majority of member states have turned against the UK and voted in favour of pushing forward on the next round of contracts for the £8bn project, despite requests for a delay to allow negotiations over British involvement to progress. UK firms are being blocked from bidding for contracts.Galileo is an £8bn satellite navigation system intended to rival the US-controlled global positioning system. Once fully operational in 2020 it will provide accurate position, navigation and timing information to be used by governments, citizens, industry and the military.British companies have been central to its design and build. A technical paper handed to EU negotiators last month warned that restricting UK involvement would lead to delays of up to three years and an additional cost to the EU of about €1bn. .The result prompted a furious response from the UK science minister, Sam Gyimah, who repeated the claim that Britain was willing to “walk away” from the project, to develop a rival satellite. The UK was beaten by a “simple majority” within the 28 member states.Gyimah said: “The government has been clear that our preference is to contribute fully to Galileo as part of a deep security partnership with the EU, and that negotiations should be allowed to run their course. By forcing through this vote, while excluding UK companies from the contracts on unfounded security grounds, the European Commission has put this at risk. “There is an option on the table that would benefit both the UK and EU. If that is not accepted by the EU, we are a proud and confident nation and will be looking at all alternatives.”The development came 24 hours after European commission officials secured support from the 27 member states for their decision to treat the UK like any other non-EU country, despite concerns among some at the high-handed approach of its officials on the issue. France, the UK’s closest security partner in the EU, which is particularly keen for tight cooperation in the future, backed Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator.A commission slide presentation to the member states was made public on Wednesday that dismissed British demands as seeking to go beyond what is possible for third countries.The document insisted that the EU’s guiding philosophy was that a country withdrawing from the union could not enjoy the same benefits as a member state.Stefaan de Rynck, an aide to Barnier, tweeted on their publication: “As @MichelBarnier said in a speech on 14 May, ‘we need to put the cooperation on Galileo between the EU and the UK on a new basis’”. The development is likely to infect the wider negotiations. The UK has warned of irreparable damage to security cooperation should the EU insist on blocking its requests for a status on the project similar to that enjoyed today.Yet this week’s commission paper claims the UK is seeking a “change of nature” of the programme, turning it into an international endeavour rather than a purely EU one.There would be a loss of “strategic autonomy” for the bloc if it gave way to the UK’s calls for equal access to the design and development of the secure military-grade signal as the EU, the commission successfully argued.It was further agreed that the UK government could instead only have “observer status” on decisions relating to the project. Its space industry will also not be permitted the same access to contracts for security elements of the satellite system as member states.EU diplomats were quick to point out that the commission is not blocking the UK’s military from access to Galileo’s secure signal, just proprietary knowledge of its codes, design and development. In restricted circumstances, UK companies could also manufacture the receivers for the military-grade signal. But the commission managed to get agreement that the UK would not be offered a special status, a position that Downing Street claims would not be strong enough for it to put its faith in the satellite when its military was engaged in a conflict zone.EU officials have previously suggested that offering the UK access to Galileo’s secure components and development would give Downing Street the power to switch the satellite off.A UK government source said: “The suggestion the UK could ‘switch off the system’ is absurd fearmongering which ignores the strength of UK support for Europe’s security, our shared aims in Nato, and our common interests.“It implies they wish to treat us as a hostile state, which is frankly laughable. Of course, if they really are worried about it we could easily provide safeguards on that point in the terms of our access.”Last month the chancellor, Philip Hammond, warned that the UK would “have to go it alone”, if the EU maintained their position.The UK has also threatened to seek the return of its past financial contributions. Such a move would imperil the wider withdrawal agreement by opening up the sensitive matter of the country’s £39bn orce bill."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f0a7b2f929b38de6f6c5b8268d4cc64c945d612/0_29_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4626186ad6660ae65318831e6ec91dca","title":"are there any laptops with decent keyboards","story":"Julia would buy a MacBook Pro Retina but she doesn’t like the latest version’s keyboard. What are the alternatives? I recently upgraded to a used early-2015 MacBook Pro Retina because of Apple’s recent redesign of the MacBook Pro, which sliced off a little bit of thickness at the cost of various ports and the very reliable keyboard with scissor mechanism. Apple is facing class-action lawsuits over the new butterfly keyboards’ untimely breakage, and as my computer’s main job is to be a writing tool, I didn’t want to risk ending up with non-functional keys. Also, I have tried the new keyboard and I did not like the feel of it: travel seems too short and rather “flat” for my taste.However, I find laptop keyboards across all platforms are becoming flatter and slimmer, and the only ones that appear to offer mechanical keyboards are flashy gaming laptops. There aren’t any for writers.A comfortable typing experience could distinguish professional laptops from tablets and Ultrabooks, but Apple appears to be muddying that distinction. Why is that, and is there a chance it will change again? JuliaAll laptop manufacturers have been making their products thinner and lighter since British industrial designer Bill Moggridge invented the format with the GRiD Compass in 1982. However, keyboard quality didn’t start to decline dramatically until we reached the ultra-light class with the Sony X505 in 2004 and Apple’s influential MacBook Air in 2008. Both had mediocre keyboards by the standards of the day, though they don’t look all that bad in hindsight.At the time, my own portable writing tools – an IBM ThinkPad 240X and, later, a ThinkPad X31 – sacrificed both floppy and optical drives to save size and weight but they didn’t compromise on keyboard quality. In fact, ThinkPads had great keyboards right up to the X220 (2011) and similar machines. A newer, thinner design – good but not quite great – appeared in the X230 and later models. (See my earlier answer: Which ThinkPad laptops have the best keyboards?)In fact, a refurbished ThinkPad X220 with an Intel Core i5-2520M processor would still be a great writing tool for less than £200. You could make it even better with upgrades to 8GB of memory and a 120GB SSD for less than £300. It’s chunky by today’s standards but not impossibly heavy at 1.5kg.I don’t expect the pendulum to swing back. Consumers really like thin-and-light laptops, and they are choosing them based on styling, screen size, storage space, speed and price, rather than their keyboards. Even if they try a few in John Lewis, Currys PC World or a local computer store, they’re mainly evaluating one poor keyboard against another.Mass-market buyers clearly don’t value keyboard quality, either because they can’t touch-type or because their main applications don’t require much typing. If you really want a better keyboard, you should look at business laptops, where the main suppliers are Lenovo (ThinkPad), Dell (Latitude, Precision) and HP (Elitebook, ProBook, ZBook).And the problem is that almost all Apple devices are designed for consumers, not for businesses, even though you can use them for business purposes. The latest MacBook Pro made that clear by not providing what business users wanted and by including lots of things they didn’t. This led to a backlash from professional users, though I’m not sure it affected sales.In 2013, Apple messed up the design of the Mac Pro, delivering a trashcan to people who needed something they could expand and upgrade, such as the old “cheese grater” tower. It took Apple years to realise its mistake, and now it won’t launch a new “modular” Mac Pro until 2019.Apple must know it has messed up the design of the MacBook Pro but a proper redesign would take time. The next version – which wasn’t announced at this month’s Apple developer conference – may just try to alleviate the keyboard’s problems with dust and debris.The real problem with laptops is that they are not ergonomic, so they are unsuitable for sustained work, regardless of the quality of the built-in keyboard. Professionals who do full-time keyboard work are either using desktop PCs or all-in-ones (such as Apple’s iMac), or they are using their laptops like desktops. They are putting the laptop on a riser to lift the screen and plugging in an external USB keyboard, which makes the quality of the laptop’s keyboard less important.Not-so-smart people who do sustained work on laptops tend to end up needing physiotherapy, like me. Bad habits can take years to catch up with you but plenty of people have worked through pain or been left unable to work at all. (See: How can I use laptops and tablets without suffering from physical pains?)If you use an external keyboard, it makes sense to choose an ergonomic model that splits the keys. This reduces the amount of wrist twisting required. Basically, the healthiest typing position is one where the hands are close to straight and flat, and aligned with your wrists and arms.Avoid keyboards with numeric keypads, or at least make sure that the alphabetical keys (TY, GH, BN) are central, or you may end up twisting your right wrist more than your left wrist.There are lots of reviews of ergonomic keyboards to help you choose one that should suit you. My next buy will be a Kinesis Freestyle Pro with – finally! – mechanical keys, when it reaches the UK.Most ergonomic keyboards don’t travel well. One exception is the Goldtouch Go! 2 mobile travel keyboard, which works in a tented position and also folds up. The keys look pretty flat in photographs, but it might appeal to someone who is developing RSI problems.As you say, there are several gaming laptops with mechanical keyboards. The idea was pioneered by MSI in 2015 with the GT80 Titan with an 18.5in screen. It used full-size Cherry MX keys. The following year, Razer launched a relatively sleek 17.3in Razer Blade Pro with a 4K-resolution 17.3in screen and “the world’s first ultra-low-profile mechanical keyboard,” developed in-house.You’re unlikely to see many in your local Starbucks.However, there is hope. This year, Cherry announced a new MX Low Profile RGB switch, which reduces the total key height from 18.5mm to 11.9mm. The key still provides 3mm of travel, which is less than an old-style IBM Model M keyboard but better than the 1mm-2mm you get with a really flat keyboard.Cherry says that the new switches “can be used just as easily for mechanical keyboards in high-end notebooks as for unusually thin mechanical desktop keyboards,” but I expect they’ll mainly be used in gaming laptops. They also have RGB coloured lights so they probably wouldn’t appeal to Apple.You’ve just bought an early-2015 MacBook Pro Retina with a far higher spec than you need for writing – 2.7GHz, 16GB, 512GB – so it should be several years before you think about replacing it. By that time, Apple might be shipping better keyboards. If not, check out some of the business ranges mentioned above, rather than the consumer models.While China’s Lenovo bought IBM’s ThinkPad ision in 2005, I assume it will keep up the tradition of shipping above-average keyboards, even if they’re not in the 240X class. Something from the current ThinkPad T range, such as the T470, might suit you. It’s more of a workhorse than the ThinkPad X1 Carbon. If you want something more like a MacBook or MacBook Air, the HP Envy and Asus ZenBook ranges generally have decent keyboards, but with the key-travel more common with thin-and-light laptops.Have you got a question?

Where was Donald Glover when I was growing up?When I was a teenager, I sometimes got called an “oreo”. You know, black on the outside, white on the inside. I was as proud as possible of being black and I’d studied black history, but to some of my peers something critical was missing, something ineffable but essential. Some heard it in the voice: not enough bass or grit or soul or something. What they were saying was that I wasn’t black enough. Few said it directly, but some did. Why?I played tennis. I spoke proper English. I unabashedly loved the Beatles. After years in prep school, they thought too much whiteness had seeped into me. This charge, dear reader, was without merit. I was neither white inside (whatever that means) nor did I wish to be white. I played tennis at a black tennis club, I lived for hip-hop, and I devoured Richard Wright’s Native Son and Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, two books that take a deep look at blackness.I knew who I was, but I also knew I was a little different. And I was a little embarrassed about it. The icons of blackness then were hyper black – this was the 1980s, it was all about Michael Jordan, Eddie Murphy and Chuck D from Public Enemy. Their performance of blackness was far from mine. But I was not alone. There were others who wanted to do blackness differently: Prince, for sure, as well as A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul. A few years later, that family had grown to include Questlove, Pharrell and Outkast.And now the tribe is being spearheaded by Donald Glover, who at this point is probably the patron saint of black kids who love being black but still get called oreo. Glover is one of the most influential stars in America today. He is the creator, writer and star of arguably the best show currently on TV: Atlanta. A dramatic comedy about black life in one of America’s blackest cities, Atlanta is a somewhat abstract series about the challenges of making it in hip-hop. It is also about the struggle to get by and – frequently – the sheer craziness of life.You may know Glover as Childish Gambino, though. That’s the name he gave his rap persona after playing with a Wu-Tang name generator. As Gambino, he is the force behind such songs as 2016’s Redbone, which won a Grammy, and This Is America, a shocking epic released last month whose video amassed 10m views in 24 hours. Given that he is also one of the stars of Solo: A Star Wars Story, in cinemas now, Glover is not so much having a moment as dominating the clock.I’ve felt a connection with Glover ever since his early days on the college campus-set TV comedy Community, which ran from 2009 to 2015. From his acting to his hip-hop to his standup, he was funny, surprising, smart and edgy. And I liked the way he presented his blackness. On the 2011 track Not Going Back, he rhymed about himself: “Black dudes assume I’m closeted or kinda gay  White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey.” He says neither black nor white people understand him because of his particular brand of blackness. And yet he is still here doing his thing because, as he says elsewhere in the song, “these smart middle-class black kids need a role model”. He was validating me in a way that a lot of hip-hop was not.In hip-hop, the proverbial real man has an air of menace about him – one look and you know he could beat you up. Think about it: you probably wouldn’t want to fight many of your favourite rappers. Jay-Z? Kendrick Lamar? Eminem? You know they’re tough. In rock, pop and R\u0026ampB, it’s different. Ed Sheeran, Chris Martin, all of Maroon 5 at once – you know you could take them.I’m not encouraging or condoning fist-fights. I haven’t had one since fifth grade. They’re primitive. I’m just saying that most of hip-hop’s alpha males present themselves as fierce, cold-hearted, drug-war-hardened soldiers who are physically superior. It’s a core part of hip-hop. But there are some big rappers you may not fear a fight with. Drake, Lil Xan and Lil Yachty leap to mind, and Glover is from that side of the aisle one of those rappers with no air of menace, more at home on a couch with Netflix than on the streets with a weapon.Season one of Atlanta touched on this when Earn, the broke music manager played by Glover, is talking to his boss, rising rapper Paper Boi. “I scare people at ATMs,” Paper Boi says. “I have to rap.” He means he emits that air of menace, so white people fear him and he can’t get a desk job. Glover is the opposite: he doesn’t make white people uncomfortable. My younger self would have been so happy to come across someone like him.Glover plays with the notion of oreoness in Atlanta. In season one, he gave us the story of a “transracial” boy: a black teenager who says he identifies as a 35-year-old white man. In season two, which begins on Fox this weekend, he gives us an unforgettable new character in whiteface. Called Teddy Perkins, he is the full Michael Jackson – though you’re never sure if it is a result of him horrifically bleaching his skin, or whether he is losing pigment after spending years locked away from the world in his mansion.Series two takes a journey to the edges of society and sanity, featuring characters who have alligators as pets, or who live hidden away from the world, in woods or in mansions. It’s called Robbin’ Season and, yeah, there is straight up mugging – but the new fringe characters also rob the leads, stealing scene after scene and even whole episodes.My favourite episode is The Barbershop, uncovers a small but vital truth. Paper Boi is taken on a wild, unwanted adventure through the edges of Atlanta by a crazy, lying, stealing, constantly hustling barber named Bibby. Why put up with all this? I don’t want to spoil the surprise.The Teddy Perkins episode is even stranger and darker. This bizarre retired musician, who may be keeping someone trapped in his mansion, speaks and moves in an overly delicate way that recalls Michael Jackson offstage. Glover may be commenting on Jackson: Perkins, we learn, became a great musician because his father was so hard on him, and he still idolises the man, even though he now seems to be adrift in life. These factors all contribute to a shocking ending.Glover has called Atlanta “Twin Peaks for rappers”, and this season perfectly captures the Kafkaesque unpredictability of black life in America the way an average moment can flip into a wild ride. Go for a haircut and end up on a crazy tour of Atlanta. Go to buy a little weed and get mugged by a friend. Go to pick up an old piano and end up watching bullets fly.All of which also feeds into This Is America, a track that contains contrasts so stark they are frequently comic. In the video, Glover dances with happy children while violent urban chaos swirls in the background. Is he ignoring the apocalypse – or distracting us from it? At the end, he poses atop a car like he’s king of the world, and the next moment he is running from a white mob with terror in his eyes. It’s a hell of a message from someone who was once thought to be oreoish, showing how quickly a black person can go from feeling on top of the world to being hunted down.As with Atlanta, white people barely figure, though the song touches on core issues in modern America: rampant gun violence, the imperative to make more money, the desire to have status and show it off. And at the centre of the circus is Glover, shirtless, wearing just some gold chains and plain grey trousers.“We just wanna party, party just for you,” he chants sweetly. But the happy vibe is shattered when he pulls out a gun and shoots a hooded man in the back of the head. Suddenly there’s a driving beat and Glover is singing “This is America” with a biting edge. But he never turns into one of those rappers we’re so familiar with, one of the Paper Bois who scare folks at ATMs. Mostly he is smiling and dancing with kids while chaos rages behind. It’s an epic statement about black music and black people, that elevates the 34-year-old Californian to the music-making elite.Years ago, Glover publicly dreamed of playing Spiderman and it seemed like a reach. Now he’s Lando Calrissian in Solo and it seems like perfect casting. In the original Star Wars trilogy, Billy Dee Williams played Solo’s friend as the coolest black man in the galaxy. Glover brings his own flavour, but his Lando is still as cool as hell. They are big shoes to fill – Lando is a classic character from my youth – but he nails it.Glover is no overnight sensation. He built to this over a decade. And he is a long, long way from being an oreo. In fact, his career is a sort of hip-hop revenge-of-the-nerds story. Nerdy guy gets called oreo and then grows up to become a rap star by repping for smart black guys who could never be thuggish. Glover is a role model for all those oreoish black guys who needed a saviour. He stepped up and, thanks to him, I know all those guys who called me an oreo were wrong. They just never understood. Most of us who seemed like oreos were like Glover. We always loved ourselves and our blackness. We always had cool somewhere inside us.And those guys who called Glover and me oreos? I bet they love Atlanta.•Season two of Atlanta begins on Fox on Sunday 17 June.•Touré hosts The Touré Show podcast.

Their roommate had brought a male friend home the night before. When she left for work, he stayed. Hours later, Naranzaya called her elder sister. “She was crying and asking: ‘Who was that man? He raped me and then he left.’”That man, they would soon learn, was a ruling party MP, Gantulga Dorjdugar, who is now under investigation. He says he has been wrongly accused and the two “mutually consented” to having sex.It is one of the most high-profile political scandals in Mongolia in years, and highlights both the progress and the challenges in a nascent but growing women’s rights movement. Saranzaya, 32, is one of a small but increasingly bold group of women calling on their country to tackle pervasive sexual violence.For some, this is the beginning of Mongolia’s #MeToo movement, though weak laws and a culture of victim-blaming mean it has a long way to go.“Some people ask why don’t we stop and why are we fighting for this,” Saranzaya said. “We want to make a path for other women. If this can win in court and they can bring justice to victims, we can prove the system is just and that will help other victims.”“In Mongolia there is huge variation in proportions of women experiencing non-partner sexual violence throughout the country. It is everywhere and sexual abuse against women is quite alarming compared with the rest of the region,” said Jansen.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theBut a backlash is building. In March a group of women knitted hundreds of red pussyhats and wore them to a protest against violence in the capital on International Women’s Day. In May a women’s group held a performance of the Vagina Monologues, translated into Mongolian. In 2016, after years of lobbying by activists and female lawmakers, the country made domestic violence a crime for the first time. Now a consortium of NGOs is pushing for sexual harassment in the workplace to be included in the country’s labour laws. Sexual assault or abuse below the level of rape is handled by the country’s human rights commission, which can only make recommendations.While awareness is increasing, justice is still rare. Naranzaya’s case stalled at first when two doctors who first examined her took a leave of absence and then were replaced. The case was reopened in August after Naranzaya’s family provided items – underwear and a duvet – found to have traces of Gantulga’s semen. Gantulga, whose lawyer did not respond to requests for comment, has repeated his client’s assertion of innocence. Women who speak out are often blamed. Late last year Bolor Zaankhuu, 33, published her own #MeToo account. Fifteen years ago, while taking an elevator up to her fourth-floor apartment, a man grabbed her from behind and groped her, she wrote in a blog. She struggled until the elevator doors opened and she ran out and down the stairs to the ground floor. When she went to the police with her father, she recalled, she was reprimanded for wearing a tank top. It was the middle of summer.“Immediately I was blamed,” she said. Bolor later identified her attacker, who spent one night at the police station before being let go. Now, she said, she waits to take elevators until no men are around and she doesn’t allow her 10-year-old daughter to go anywhere alone. A woman who lives and works in Ulaanbaatar said that on one occasion four years ago she woke up in a hotel to find a man raping her. Later when she filed a police report alleging she had been drugged and assaulted, the investigator said she was not likely to get compensation and encouraged her to drop the case. Eventually she did.“I don’t feel bad about it any more. At least, I want to shake that mindset. Women feel guilty. Because they got drunk or because they went to that party, they blame themselves … that if I hadn’t been wearing this or that, then this wouldn’t have happened,” she told the , asking that her name not be published.Women have contacted Saranzaya to say they too have been victims of sexual assault, but no one has joined her campaign. The sisters have been called prostitutes and liars. Others say Saranzaya is using her sister to try to extort money from the MP. Even women’s rights groups have stayed away after critics accused Saranzaya of being politically motivated.The number of people reporting abuse is growing, a statistic that could mean more people are willing to do so, or abuse is on the rise, or some combination of the two. At the One Stop Service Centre, a small office and room with bunkbeds at Ulaanbaatar’s main trauma hospital, abused women can shelter with their children for up to 72 hours and seek medical help, therapy and legal advice.Deedentsetseg Chuluunbayar, a social worker at the centre, said that in 2008, the first year it was open, it received around 300 women. Last year the number was 960, despite the centre closing for a month, and now it gets at least eight women a day. On payday and public holidays, more women come to the hospital with injuries. On 18 March, Soldier’s Day in Mongolia, 15 women came to the centre.Deedentsetseg said Mongolia’s new domestic violence law could lead to fewer women reporting abusive partners. In the past, women reported their husbands to the police to scare them, and then they would drop the case. Under the new law, domestic violence cases have to go forward to trial. “It’s really a difficult situation because most of the women who come here don’t want to disrupt the family and are dependent on their husbands,” Deedentsetseg said.It is unclear why sexual violence is apparently so prevalent in Mongolia, a middle-income country that prides itself on its peaceful transition from a former Soviet satellite to a democracy in 1990. Some blame a macho culture, while others point to a “reverse gender gap”. For years after the transition, families invested more of their resources in sending their daughters to school and kept their sons home to herd. Mongolian women now outpace men in education, health and work. Men have higher rates of unemployment and alcoholism, and their average life is 10 years shorter than that of women.“Men’s reputation has fallen. These things can be a reason why more men are angry with women, which leads to violence,” said Boldbaatar Tumur, head of the Men’s Association in Gobisumber province, which works on raising awareness of men’s issues.Others say Mongolia’s close-knit rural communities encourage a culture of silence. “Very few people can say ‘me too’,” said Oyungerel Tsedevdamba, a former MP who pushed for the law criminalising domestic violence. “In the countryside there is no anonymity, and because of that no one wants to speak out.”Gerelee Odonchimed, vice-director for education and advocacy at Women for Change, a women’s empowerment group, said Mongolia’s women rights movement needed more patience. “It can be slow but, yes, time is up,” she said. “We aren’t talking about changing the colours of the walls. We are talking about changing people’s minds.”Saranzaya and Naranzaya are also taking things slowly. They have moved into a new apartment and Naranzaya, 26, is back at school, studying to become a teacher. “She’s starting to feel OK again,” Saranzaya said of her sister.This week Gantulga, the accused MP, resigned from parliament. Saranzaya has noticed that when the case is in the news again, her sister slips back into a depression. She has wondered whether they ought to drop the case and move on with their lives. “I said if it’s too difficult we can stop, but she says no, we will fight together.”Additional reporting by Munkhchimeg Davaasharav• This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Photograph: Bryan O’Brien The Department of Education is reviewing the granting of exemptions from studying Irish amid evidence that thousands of students who secure them are sitting exams in foreign languages.The latest official figures show 3,851 students were granted an exemption to sit the Leaving Cert Irish exam in 2016 on the grounds of a disability.Almost 60 per cent of these (2,227 students) went on to study a European language such as French, German or Spanish.Students or their parents are required to submit a psychologist’s report in order to secure an exemption on the grounds of disability.However, the validity of some privately commissioned psychologists’ reports have been queried by senior education figures.The National University of Ireland (NUI) said it had challenged cases where psychologists’ reports were not accurate.“Where it has appeared to us that psychologists have not fully understood our criteria, we have clarified these for them,” said Dr Attracta O’Halpin, the NUI’s registrar. “We are keeping the system under review and are monitoring it closely.”Some school principals have questioned the reasons behind the numbers amid claims that the system is being “gamed” in order to avoid what many students perceive to be one of the most challenging Leaving Cert subjects.Clive Byrne, of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said: “Certain school leaders have queried the increase in numbers of students with exemptions in Irish, and the implications it may have for third level progression.”However, the Dyslexia Association of Ireland has insisted there are genuine reasons why many students who secure exemptions end up studying a European language.The association says students with dyslexia need additional time and learning support in order to build their literacy skills in English at primary level.Many of these students may go on to learn a second language in secondary school at the same time as other pupils.While the association has accepted that some iniduals may try to “play” the system, it has said the criteria to get an Irish exemption on the grounds of dyslexia are very stringent.The Department has confirmed it is reviewing arrangements for the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish.It intends to publish the review and draft revised circulars early in the new school year.“The outcome of this public consultation process will inform the finalisation of revised arrangements for the granting of exemptions from the study of Irish,” it said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3529625.1528926355!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"psychiatrists resigning as position untenable and unsafe","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil TD for Wexford James Browne said it was his understanding all other Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service staff working under the psychiatrists “can no longer effectively do their jobs because they’ve no one to oversee them”.  Photograph: Eric LukeChildren in Wexford and Waterford face the prospect of having no public consultant psychiatric services from next month due to the resignation of psychiatrists who are concerned about working in unsafe conditionsDr Kieran Moore, a specialist consultant paediatric psychiatrist, on Wednesday told the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Future of Mental Healthcare that he and two of his colleagues from the southeast region were resigning. “I’m resigning from Wexford because it’s untenable and unsafe and two of my colleagues are doing the same,” he said. Dr Moore said patients were coming into a building that “is in a state” and where staff are “burnt out”. He said mental health services required continuous funding and “looking after the people who look after patients”. The prevalence of those suffering from mental health problems was increasing, he said, describing the issue as “a national emergency”. Senator Joan Freeman, the chair of the committee, which was examining staffing difficulties in psychiatric services, said that unless the psychiatrists are replaced “there will be no services for children” in Wexford and Waterford. “I personally find that extremely disturbing,” she said. Mr Browne said it was also his understanding that all other Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS) staff working under the psychiatrists such as psychologists and occupational therapists “can no longer effectively do their jobs because they’ve no one to oversee them”. Dr Moore added “where I work in Wexford, there are five managers, none of them is clear about what they do”. “Honestly if we’re to talk about staff recruitment and retention, the one thing that works is if people feel valued and they don’t,” he said. In a statement, the HSE said it was currently operating a national and international recruitment campaign for consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists. “South East Community Healthcare plans to draw on this resource to fill positions on a permanent basis, in addition to vacancies being filled on an interim or temporary basis,” it said. Declan O’Hanlon, of the Irish Hospital Consultants’ Association, told the committee that of 44 consultant psychiatrist posts advertised in 2015 and 2016, about one-quarter had no applicants and 30 per cent had one applicant. “The failure to fill consultant psychiatrist posts is severely undermining the quality and quantity of the psychiatry service that can be provided to patients,” he said. Peter Hughes, general secretary of the Psychiatric Nurses’ Association said a recent survey of the union’s branches suggested there were about 500 nursing vacancies in the mental health services with shortages expected to “exacerbate significantly” in the next four years. Rosarii Mannion, the HSE’s national human resources director, said it is likely to face a changing industrial relations environment that may add to the challenges impacting on the overall attracting, recruitment and retention of staff. “Another significant emerging issue is the possible fallout from Brexit on the health workforce both in Ireland and in Britain and Northern Ireland over the next number of years,” Ms Mannion said.

Indeed, 100 extra librarians are to be hired in coming monthsThe plan, which will be backed by nearly €5 million from the Government and local authorities, aims to double library membership from 750,000 to 1.5 million within the next five years.There are also wider plans to upgrade dozens of libraries, develop digital learning centres in all suitable libraries and position libraries as a community hub.Tom Enright, chief executive of Wexford County Council, who chairs the State’s Libraries Development Committee, said libraries had to respond to the way people live and work now.“Many people commute long distances to work and cannot get to the library between 9am and 5pm,” said Mr Enright.“It’s a shame to have these buildings closed, but 23 of them will be available to local communities outside of library hours and that number will be further expanded over the next five years,” he explained.Forty libraries will be improved over the next five years: “We expect to see a range of capital projects being developed to address the improvements required,” he went on.The recruitment of extra librarians – from county librarian to dozens in branches across the State – can be filled following a recent successful conciliation process with the public service union Fórsa.A bid to capture the interest of primary schoolchildren and older people in membership of 330 public libraries and 31 mobile ones is also in the pipeline, said Mr Enright.Libraries will stock more books about health to cope with greater interest in the subject from readers, who already make 17 million visits annually and borrow 18 million books, DVDs and journals.A grant of €400,000 last year, made through Healthy Ireland and the HSE, had enabled the library service to acquire a large number of health and medical-orientated books for its shelves.“We are confident of receiving further funding in the current year which would allow us to extend the range of health and medical-related material further,” he added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530273.1528964973!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"royal visit could showcase cork as tourist destination says lord mayor","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPrince Charles, Prince of Wales and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall  mark the 20th anniversary of the Omagh bombing at Memorial Garden in Omagh, Northern Ireland. Photograph: Charles McQuillanGetty ImagesThursday’s visit to Cork by the Prince of Wales, Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall provides a tremendous opportunity to showcase the city and build its profile as a tourist destination, according to the Lord Mayor of Cork, Cllr Tony Fitzgerald. Cllr Fitzgerald, who is due to host a civic reception at Cork City Hall for the pair, said that Cork had benefitted hugely from the positive image of the city generated when Queen Elizabeth II visited Leeside in 2011.“The people of Cork have very fond memories of the visit by Queen Elizabeth II to Cork in 2011 when it was clear to all that the Queen thoroughly enjoyed her time in the city, describing it in a letter afterwards to the Lord Mayor’s office as ‘colourful and lively’,” he said.Cllr Fitzgerald pointed out that Cork’s international profile “skyrocketed” after the visit by Queen Elizabeth II with footfall increasing by 30 per cent in the English Market where she was photographed laughing heartily at a joke from local fishmonger, Pat O’Connell. Bookings in hotel rooms in the city and county went up by 70 per cent and with the most recent tourism statistics showing that over 30 per cent of the city’s overseas visitors come from the UK, the visit by Prince Charles and Camilla provides Cork with another great opportunity to showcase itself internationally.Security will be tight in Cork for the visit which will see Prince Charles and Camilla visit the English Market and Cork City Hall for the civic reception before Prince Charles visits University College Cork, the National Maritime College of Ireland and the Naval Service HQ in Cork Harbour.The pair will also observe a minute’s silence for the victims of the Grenfell Tower tragedy during their visit to Cork City Hall.While there they will be in the presence of one hundred and fifty invited guests including Olympian Rob Heffernan, All Ireland winning camogie player and mental health advocate Aisling Thompson, the Young Offenders’ writer and director Peter Foote and his wife actress Hillary Rose and chef Rachel Allen from Ballymaloe House.The royal couple will also be introduced to some of the city’s great innovators such as James Whelton from Coder Dojo who set up the first ever Coder Dojo clubs in Cork. Coder Dojo is now a global network of computer programming clubs that offers free coding glasses to tens of thousands of children internationally. The visitors will also meet with founding members of iWish, the annual showcase event set up in Cork to inspire, encourage and motivate young girls to pursue careers in Science Technology, Engine and Maths. It brings thousands of young women to the RDS and Cork City Hall every year.The Duchess of Cornwall will visit the National Guide Dogs Training Centre on the Model Farm Road before the couple will attend a banquet in their honour on Thursday night at the Crawford Art Gallery. They will stay overnight in Ballyvolane House in North Cork and go on to Kerry on Friday. The visit by Prince Charles and Camilla will lead to a number of street closures in Cork city centre on Thursday including the Garda Parade, Tuckey Street, Oliver Plunkett Street, Lapp’s Quay and the South Mall from the Grand Parade to Parliament Street.Parking restrictions will also apply with parking prohibited from Academy Street to Daunt Square, the Grand Parade, the South Mall, Oliver Plunkett Street from Prince’s Street to the Grand Parade, Lapp’s Quay, Kyrl’s Street and Anglesea Street.Meanwhile campaigners against a proposed €160 million incinerator planned for Rinagskiddy are to hold a silent and peaceful protest when Prince Charles passes through the harbour village on his way to the Maritime College and the Naval Service HQ.Back in Cork city, a group called The Cork Friends of the Ballymurphy Massacre Families are to hold what they say will be “a peaceful and dignified protest” on St Patrick’s Bridge from 7pm to 8pm when Prince Charles will attend a banquet in the nearby Crawford Art Gallery.A spokesman for the group said that the protest was designed to highlight the continuing quest for justice by people in Ballymurphy in West Belfast when soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment were involved in the shooting dead of eleven civilians in August 1971.The protest was organised because Prince Charles is Colonel in Chief of the Parachute Regiment, which was also involved in the killing of 14 civilians in Derry on Bloody Sunday in January 1972, and there remained “outstanding legacy of state violence which need to be addressed.”“While the British Government has apologised for Bloody Sunday following a lengthy campaign for justice and subsequent inquiry, the Ballymurphy Massacre Families have been left without justice to date. The group has campaigned for 47 years to get truth and justice. “The PSNI and the Ministry of Defence continue to block and stall the inquests. Both organisations refuse to trace military witnesses. A similar approach has been taken to tracking guns used and vital evidence relating to the cases has disappeared,” said the spokesman for the Cork group."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530283.1528966108!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"storm hector leaves 35 000 premises without power","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tESB crews are working to restore power after Storm Hector brought down trees in many areas. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe .Some 35,000 premises have been left without power as a result of Storm Hector. The storm made landfall in the early hours of Thursday morning, bringing down trees which in turn brought down power lines. A status orange wind warning was issued for counties Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Sligo from 9pm on Wednesday to 10am on Thursday, with wind gusts of up to 125kmh.The counties most impacted include Galway, Mayo, Sligo and Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan. High spring tides are likely to coincide with the strongest winds, leading to a risk of coastal flooding and mountainous waves.Donegal Bay, Clew Bay in Co Mayo and Galway Bay were among the coastal areas most at risk.The highest wind speed was r at Mace Head, Galway, with a gust of 111 kmh recorded at 3am on Thursday morning. Mean wind speeds of between 65kmh and 80kmh were experienced at different stations on the west coast. ESB Network spokeswoman Bernardine Maloney said crews are mobilised and are working towards restoring power to all impacted families over the course of Thursday. She told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that it was mainly fallen trees that had caused the power outages across the country. The worst affected areas were in the North West.She pointed out that there was the added problem that the trees have summer foliage.However, she explained that in many instances one fallen tree was having an impact on numerous customers, so once that tree was cleared power could be restored swiftly.“We expect to have power back to everyone by this evening.”In Donegal the N56 is impassable at Stragraddy in Termon due to a fallen tree. In Inishowen there is a fallen tree and electricity pole on the Gleneely Road (R238) in Moville. In Monaghan the N2 is down to one lane between Emyvale and Aughnacloy at Elvey due to a fallen tree. There is serious damage to the surface of the Ballybay Road (R183) outside Clones due to the severe weather. There are reports of trees being down in the midlands and a tree is blocking the Castlepollard-Delvin Road, the Portarlington road out of Tullamore and the Ratoath-Curragha road in Meath. There are also reports of a tree partially blocking the N4 eastbound at Enfield. The status orange warning remained in place for Donegal, Galway, Mayo and Sligo and a status yellow wind warning was in place for counties Dublin, Kildare, Longford, Louth, Offaly, Westmeath, Meath, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Roscommon, Clare and Kerry until 10am on Thursday. It is now located 300 nautical kilometres to the north of Ireland and the winds have started to die down.

But opposition TDs didn’t let the occasion of Leo Varadkar’s first anniversary as Taoiseach go unmarked.Technically, they were a little early but, as he doesn’t do Leaders’ Questions on Thursday, his milestone moment was noted a day in advance.Not even 40 years old yet and already a year in the top job.The Opposition members are deeply unimpressed and happily sneered their best wishes to him from across the floor.It was Catherine Murphy of the Social Democrats who mentioned Leo’s political landmark.“A year ago this week you became Taoiseach and told us of your vision for a republic of opportunities,” she reminded him, pointing out that his anniversary has coincided with a visit to Ireland from Leilani Farha, who is the UN Special Rapporteur on adequate housing.“Ms Farha had one clear message, and that is that Ireland is failing abysmally when it comes to housing,” Catherine told him.And speaking of the republic of opportunities, she threw in the latest comments from the Children’s Ombudsman who has described the position of almost 10,000 people in emergency accommodation as “shameful”.So how does Leo feel about the housing crisis getting worse since he took office and what does he intend to do to address this unacceptable situation?The Taoiseach rose to his feet and, naturally, began his response by ignoring the substance of the question. You don’t spend 12 months in the Taoiseach’s office and not learn a thing or two about talking down the clock in the Dáil.“It is indeed a year tomorrow – it’s my anniversary of my election as Taoiseach.”“Where’s the party?” wondered Mattie McGrath, in a somewhat sarcastic tone.Leo wittered on. “I have to say, eh, I’m not, I’m not one for anniversaries or birthdays. I’m known to forget them or very often decline to celebrate them.”But Leo wasn’t finished. “I think the milestones that are important are not the ones that appear on a calendar - they are the things you’ve achieved along the way.”And on he went.“I am very proud to have been part of a Government in the past year that has successfully brought about a referendum to repeal the Eighth Amendment, has at long last ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, has brought employment to record levels – the highest ever. . .”There was hardly a dry seat in the House.“A lot more to do!” chortled Sinn Féin’s Sean Crowe.Leo pressed on with his greatest hits. But he was performing for a tough crowd.Róisín Shortall of the Soc Dems told him to get on with it. “Answer the question and stop trying to run down the clock.”As a derisory chorus of “more to do!” rang around the chamber, the Taoiseach continued singing his own praises.“. . . has balanced the books, has improved living standards, has reduced income inequality, has reduced poverty and reduced deprivation . . .”“It’s the Leo show,” harrumphed Mattie.Finally, Leo got around to the question, sounding like he’d swallowed Fianna Fáil’s 2002 “A lot done. More to do” election manifesto for breakfast.“But, as the hecklers rightly point out, there is a lot more to do and there is always more to do and, particularly, housing is one of those areas in which there is very much more to do.”Delivering a searing insight into how to tackle the homeless crisis, Leo declared: “What we actually need to do is build more houses and the crux of the solution to this is increasing housing supply.” Since he became Taoiseach, planning permissions and commencement notices are up by 30 per cent, while the construction of 18,000 new homes has started in the past year, he added.“House prices and rents are also up,” retorted Fianna Fáil’s John Lahart.“Fiasco!” roared his colleague, Eugene Murphy.“What about social housing?” demanded Sinn Féin’s Dessie Ellis as the anniversary boy continued his recitation. “More so than any year in the past 10. ESB connections again up 30 per cent, employment in the construction sector up 14 per cent.”“We’re all grand so,” giggled Brendan Howlin.In the year to come, his Government will be adding up to 8,000 new social homes, promised Leo, flushed with success after his fabulous year.“So we have a long, long way to go yet . . . We are finally starting to catch up and we’re starting to see that now in the figures. But the Deputy is absolutely right, we have much more to do and it’s going to take many more years.”Catherine Murphy thought it would be a good idea if the Taoiseach formally met Leilani Farha to discuss housing policy as she has some tangible solutions around developing a coherent housing strategy, especially in areas such as the private rental sector.Leo wasn’t against the idea, although he knows Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy has already met her. Although Leilani “at the time, hadn’t had the chance to read Rebuilding Ireland, so perhaps, as part of that engagement, we could get her views on Rebuilding Ireland and what she thinks of that.”Some gals have all the luck.And, still with the Varadkar landmark date, Independent TD Tommy Broughan was also looking to rain on Leo’s parade.“Taoiseach, is it not a characteristic of your first year in office that we are having a growing breakdown of law and order?” he asked.“It seems as though almost every day of the week now we have an appalling murder or homicide,” observed Tommy, taking out a big pin to burst Leo’s happy anniversary balloon. “It’s astonishing, isn’t it, that Fine Gael is presiding over this growing lawlessness and appalling homicides and appalling criminal behaviour. What are you going to do about it?”No, it is not astonishing, sniffed Leo. Furthermore, the number of gardaí has never been higher.He told Tommy he was “misinformed and out of date”.And anyway, it isn’t even his anniversary.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530319.1528965574!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pompeo says north korea sanctions relief hinges on denuclearisation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS secretary of state Mike Pompeo with Gen Vincent K Brooks, commander of United States Forces Korea, at Osan Air Base in Pyeongtaek, South Korea. Photograph:  Jung Yeon-jeAFPGetty ImagesMike Pompeo said there would be no let-up of sanctions on North Korea until the rogue regime had completed denuclearisation, contradicting Pyongyang’s earlier claims that the US was poised to lift trade curbs.The US secretary of state made the comments on Thursday after meeting his South Korean and Japanese counterparts in Seoul to brief them of the results of this week’s summit between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.Mr Pompeo said at a joint press conference that the three countries were committed to complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, and stressed that verification was central to North Korea’s denuclearisation.Mr Pompeo stressed that the North Korean leader understood that denuclearisation should be done quickly and repeated that Pyongyang could obtain relief from tough international sanctions only after its complete denuclearisation.“We’re going to get denuclearisation . . . only then will there be relief from sanctions,” he said. He said Pyongyang was committed to abandoning its nuclear arsenal but cautioned that it would be “a process, not an easy one”.But he again bristled at a question about why the summit joint statement did not include the term CVID, repeating that the word “complete” encompasses “verifiable and irreversible”.Before holding the three-way talks with Seoul’s foreign minister Kang Kyung-wha and Japanese foreign minister Taro Kono, Mr Pompeo met South Korean president Moon Jae-in, who praised the Singapore summit.There may be very conflicting views regarding the outcome of the summit, but I believe that the most important thing is that the people of the world, including those in the US, Japan and Korea, have all been able to escape the threat of war, nuclear weapons and long-range missiles,” Mr Moon told Mr Pompeo.Mr Moon’s positive comments came soon after Mr Trump declared that North Korea was no longer a nuclear threat, despite criticism that Mr Trump had failed to secure any concrete steps towards denuclearisation from his meeting with Mr Kim. Mr Pompeo said Mr Trump’s latest remarks were made “with eyes wide open”.Mindful of growing criticism, Mr Pompeo pushed back on a North Korean media report that Mr Trump had agreed to eliminate sanctions along the path to denuclearisation and that the US and North Korea had agreed to a “step-by-step” process whereby Pyongyang would be rewarded for achieving interim goals along the way – a process that the US previously said was unacceptable.Asked on Wednesday if the North Korean account of the summit, which was published in a statement by KCNA, a state-run outlet, was accurate, Mr Pompeo said: “One should heavily discount some things that are written in other places.”Mr Pompeo, who is charged with leading follow-up negotiations with Pyongyang, said a day earlier that he would like to accomplish major nuclear disarmament of North Korea before Mr Trump’s first term ends.Over the past two days, Mr Pompeo has also rejected suggestions that Mr Trump was outplayed by Mr Kim and that their joint statement amounted to a big concession to North Korea.US officials have urged people to ignore the omission from the statement of CVID, which the Trump administration had frequently used to define the goal of any potential negotiations with North Korea towards abandoning its nuclear programme.Pressed on the issue by reporters in Seoul on Wednesday, Mr Pompeo responded: “I find that question insulting and ridiculous and, frankly, ludicrous. I just have to be honest with you. It’s a game and one ought not play games with serious matters like this.” – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Iran remains in US crosshairs despite the North Korean threat being far greaterGeneral Assembly seeks \u0026lsquointernational protection mechanism\u0026rsquo for occupied territoryUN among those warning move on Houthi rebels may kill and maim 250,000 civiliansRed Sea port of Hodeidah, held by Houthi rebels, is aid lifeline for millions of YemenisSyrian Democratic Council would have to break with US to achieve rapprochementSurprise announcement by militants come days after government declared unconditional ceasefireT\u0026aacutenaiste holds discussions with Israeli and Palestinian officials on trip to Middle EastHuman rights groups have accused Israel of using excessive force, which it deniesT\u0026aacutenaiste urges two-state solution for Israel and PalestineMatch in Jerusalem was to have been Argentina\u0026rsquos final World Cup warm-upRazan al-Najar (21) was killed running towards border fence in bid to help a casualtySupreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vows that Iran will preserve nuclear programmeKingdom prepares to lift ban on women driving amid crackdown on activistsJordanian prime minister refuses to scrap an IMF-backed tax Bill amid continued unrestAfter mortars and air strikes, Israeli minister Yisrael Katz warns of being on brink of warHuman rights defenders more and more in crosswires since president\u0026rsquos re-electionFighting breaks out as rebels attack Syrian army baseIsraelis on alert as Muslims celebrate second Friday of Ramadan holy monthTehran imposes May 31st as date by which to receive plan for accord post-US withdrawalAt least 11 who pressed for women to be allowed drive arrested despite change in law"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530264.1528955154!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"un condemns excessive israeli force against palestinians","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley speaks to the UN General Assembly before a vote in New York. Photograph: Don EmmertAFPGetty ImagesThe United Nations General Assembly condemned Israel on Wednesday for excessive use of force against Palestinian civilians.It has also asked UN chief Antonio Guterres to recommend an “international protection mechanism” for occupied Palestinian territory.The General Assembly adopted a resolution with 120 votes in favour, eight against and 45 abstentions. It was put forward in the General Assembly on Wednesday by Algeria, Turkey and the Palestinians after the United States vetoed a similar resolution in the 15-member UN Security Council earlier this month.The General Assembly text condemned the firing of rockets from Gaza into Israeli civilian areas, but did not mention Hamas, the Islamist group that controls Gaza. General Assembly resolutions are not legally binding but carry political weight.“The nature of this resolution clearly demonstrates that politics is driving the day. It is totally one-sided. It makes not one mention of the Hamas terrorists who routinely initiate the violence in Gaza,” US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the General Assembly before the vote.The US failed in a bid to amend the resolution with a paragraph that would have condemned violence by Hamas.“By supporting this resolution you are colluding with a terrorist organisation, by supporting this resolution you are empowering Hamas,” Israel’s UN ambassador Danny Danon told the General Assembly before the vote.Australia, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, Solomon Islands and Togo joined Israel and the United States in voting against the resolution.More than 120 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces in Gaza border protests since March 30th. The largest number of deaths occurred on May 14th, the day the United States moved its embassy in Israel to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.Amid international condemnation of its use of lethal force, Israel said many of the dead were militants and that the Israeli army was repelling attacks on the border fence between Israel and Gaza. Washington has maintained Israel’s right to defend itself and refrained from joining calls for Israeli restraint.Palestinians and their supporters said most protesters were unarmed civilians and Israel used excessive force against them.“We need protection of our civilian population,” Palestinian UN envoy Riyad Mansour told the General Assembly before the vote, adding that the resolution was “intended to contribute to a de-escalation of the volatile situation.”“We cannot remain silent in the face of the most violent crimes and human rights violations being systematically perpetrated against our people,” Mr Mansour said.The resolution asked Mr Guterres to report back within 60 days on proposals “on ways and means for ensuring the safety, protection and well-being of the Palestinian civilian population under Israeli occupation, including ... recommendations regarding an international protection mechanism.”In December, 128 countries defied US president Donald Trump and voted in favour of a General Assembly resolution calling for the United States to drop its recognition of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital. - Reuters"},{"url":null,"title":"magnum freedom project pictures","story":"1968 was a seismic year of deep societal and political shifts.

who are counterclaiming against the Russells for around £20,000 in unpaid fees - said the blame for the delay, the walkout by the builders and the significant overspend lay with the Russells.She described their attitude as unrealistic and impractical and said late design decisions bedeviled this project, adding: The problems on this project were not of PSP\u0027s making.Peter and Linda Stone, who managed the bespoke project, arriving at courtThe Stones consistently advised and warned Mr and Mrs Russell that it was imperative that they make design decisions to enable the building works to progress and of the dangers should they fail to do so. But they were unable or unwilling to heed that advice and these are the very dangers which befell this project, Ms McCafferty told the judge.They chose to ignore that advice at the time and, all these years on, still seem unable to understand those consequences.Ms McCafferty added: This is all the more distressing for Mr and Mrs Stone because they strongly believed that they did a very good job in very challenging circumstances on this difficult project.In the witness box, Mr Russell, 62, defended the time he and his wife took in making a decision over their choice of interior fittings, telling Mrs Justice Jefford: If you\u0027d seen the house you\u0027d understand this is not some Barratt home.”He added: Dealing with curves in this way is so complex. It\u0027s very difficult to fit it together. Take our television room I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a word to describe something that has one straight line and three curves.”Mr Russell, a director at more than 20 property and finance companies in London, said it was perfectly reasonable to be concerned over the interior details. But he rejected accusations he and his wife had procrastinated over their choices..What we wanted was our house to be our house with everything we wanted. If you are building your own home, you want the design to be what you want and the quality to be what you want,” he said. I think where we live has a certain expectation of level of standard.”Luxury property and architectureRussia’s ‘psychic’ cat Achilles predicts the winner of the opening World Cup gameMike Pompeo warns North Korea sanctions will not be lifted before denuclearisationGrenfell Tower victims remembered one year on with national minute\u0026#39s silenceUK weather: Storm Hector batters Britain with winds of up to 100mphRevenge porn victims must be given anonymity to prevent third of cases being dropped, policing chief says Roseanne Barr claims \u0026#39Planet of the Apes\u0026#39 tweet was \u0026#39about anti-Semitism\u0026#39Australia punished soldiers for flying Nazi flag in AfghanistanRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranLove Island\u0026#39s Samira reportedly being sued for quitting DreamgirlsGrenfell Tower floodlit green to mark one-year anniversary of fire as poignant vigil heldFormer Rolls-Royce engineer \u0026#39arrested under Official Secrets Act\u0026#39 amid fears China tried to obtain F-35 fighter jet detailsLewisham fire: Dozens of firefighters tackle blaze in 20-storey apartment building in LondonRebel Wilson\u0026#39s record defamation payout in Australia slashed by millionsOxfam Great Britain permanently banned from operating in Haiti after sex scandalPolice investigate elder abuse of Marvel Comics\u0026#39 Stan LeeYouths destroy landmark rock that had balanced on crag since the Ice Age Pushy parents told to stop using smartphone video evidence to challenge sports day resultsFoie gras imports could be banned after Brexit on ethical groundsTrident nuclear sites at risk due to \u0026#39exodus\u0026#39 of MoD PoliceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/06/13/TELEMMGLPICT000117790217_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqiRN6Mu3yrcsIjf4WNWmPzCQ6fy2WQk5poB-BTNBu4Gk.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"strawberry glut means supermarkets selling cheap super size","story":"digitalservices@telegraphGo and get your strawberries while they are cheap, the leading soft fruits body has saidCheap strawberries are flooding supermarket aisles this week due to a glut caused by this year\u0027s extreme weather.Retailers across the country are selling super-sized, reduced-price punnets, and farmers say the unusually cold spring means the fruit took longer to ripen, making the strawberries much bigger, sweeter and juicier than usual.Not only are the strawberries more delicious, the recent hot weather caused the fruit to ripen all at once, making for a giant crop.Waitrose has reduced the price of its fruit, after the recent rise in temperatures forced the plants into a slightly later-than-usual season.Nicki Baggott, Waitrose strawberry buyer, said: Strawberries love the sunshine and with the recent rise in temperatures, we\u0027ve seen a bumper crop of the delicious summer fruit making its way to our shelves.As our yields are up, we\u0027ve reduced our prices to reflect this. In particular, our exclusive Summer Blush Strawberries are growing extremely well and are perfect for our customers to use in their puds, pavlovas and Pimm\u0027s.Discount supermarket Aldi has bought an additional 112 tonnes of strawberries to support British growers, who have too much fruit on their hands.The supermarket will sell larger punnets at £2.95 per kg across many of  its stores, which will be alongside Aldi’s existing punnet  (£1.39 - 400g).Julie Ashfield, Managing Director of Buying at Aldi UK, said: “The recent warm weather has led to our growers needing to harvest a vast amount of their crop much later than usual. We always try to find ways to support them in times like this, while at the same time reducing unnecessary food waste. “British strawberries are also typically brighter in colour and tastier compared with imported varieties, meaning our customers can enjoy more of the fruit at the best time of the year.”Growers are also getting a good deal each farm will be paid the same rate per kg of produce by Aldi as they would have done without the promotion.Tesco is also running a promotion, selling two of its £2 400g punnets for £3, while Sainsbury\u0027s has reduced its 400g punnet from £2 to £1.60.The cold spring meant the fruit took longer to ripen - making it more deliciousFarmers are urging customers to get their strawberries while they are still cheap and deliciously sweet.Nick Marston, chairman of British Summer Fruits, said: February and March this year were considerably colder than in 2017. The strawberry crops develop more slowly if the weather is cooler.There is a good level of supply, and because they\u0027ve ripened more slowly they are bigger, tastier and juicier than last year.Because there is a good level of supply supermarkets have promotions in place for the next few days. These include Kilo boxes, two for one deals and all sorts. We say that customers should rush out and buy strawberries now while the offers are on the very good quality fruit.He added that while the strawberry season usually starts on May 1, the chilly spring meant it was a week and a half late. Now, the crop is in full swing, and it is likely the season will carry on successfully until July.However, those hoping the glut will mean a discount day out at Wimbledon are going to be disappointed.A spokesperson for the tennis competition said: The strawberries and cream at Wimbledon will once again be priced at £2.50 – the price has remained the same since 2010.Please review our commenting policyGrenfell Tower victims remembered one year on with national minute\u0026#39s silenceUK weather: Storm Hector batters Britain with winds of up to 100mphRevenge porn victims must be given anonymity to prevent third of cases being dropped, policing chief says Roseanne Barr claims \u0026#39Planet of the Apes\u0026#39 tweet was \u0026#39about anti-Semitism\u0026#39Australia punished soldiers for flying Nazi flag in AfghanistanRamadan 2018: Why Muslims celebrate the revelation of the KoranLove Island\u0026#39s Samira reportedly being sued for quitting DreamgirlsGrenfell Tower floodlit green to mark one-year anniversary of fire as poignant vigil heldFormer Rolls-Royce engineer \u0026#39arrested under Official Secrets Act\u0026#39 amid fears China tried to obtain F-35 fighter jet detailsLewisham fire: Dozens of firefighters tackle blaze in 20-storey apartment building in LondonRebel Wilson\u0026#39s record defamation payout in Australia slashed by millionsOxfam Great Britain permanently banned from operating in Haiti after sex scandalPolice investigate elder abuse of Marvel Comics\u0026#39 Stan LeeYouths destroy landmark rock that had balanced on crag since the Ice Age Pushy parents told to stop using smartphone video evidence to challenge sports day resultsFoie gras imports could be banned after Brexit on ethical groundsTrident nuclear sites at risk due to \u0026#39exodus\u0026#39 of MoD PoliceThree bodies found at foot of Beachy Head as police hunt for fourth personFacebook exposes British children to violence and bullying, major NSPCC study findsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/13/16/buddhism-religion.jpg","title":"religion live longer muslim jewish christian hindu buddhist life expectancy age","story":"Created with Sketch.Abstinence, meditation and social ties may all be a factor in increased longevityClick to followThe Independent OnlineAbstinence and stress-relieving practices could contribute to increased longevityReligious people live on average four years longer than their agnostic and atheist peers, new research has found.\u0026nbspThe difference between practising worshippers and those who were not part of a religious group could be down to a mix of social support, stress-relieving practices\u0026nbspand abstaining from unhealthy habits, the authors suggest.For the study, a team of Ohio University academics, including associate professor of psychology Christian End, analysed more than 1,500 obituaries from across the US to piece together how the defining features of our lives affect our longevity.The surprising effects of loneliness on healthAtheists gather together to help homeless people in South CarolinaRecord number of British people say they have no religionThese records include religious affiliations and marriage details as well as information on activities, hobbies and habits, which can help or hinder our health, not otherwise captured in census data.The study, published in Social Psychological and Personality Science today, found that on average people whose obituary mentioned they were religious lived an extra 5.64 years.Life expectancy was still 3.82 years longer in religious people when they statistically controlled for marriage rates, a factor which has been shown to increase life expectancy and help stave off disease.“The study provides persuasive evidence that there is a relationship between religious participation and how long a person lives,” said Baldwin Way, co-author of the study and associate professor of psychology at Ohio State University.The major part of the study used more than 1,000 obituaries from newspapers in 42 states. But a further analysis of 500 obituaries from the Des Moines Register, a paper in Iowa, found the effect was more pronounced and religion was associated with an extra 6.48 years of life, suggesting living in a more religious area might have an extra effect.Religious participation often goes hand-in-hand with increased participation in activities and social groups, which might help tackle loneliness and sedentary lifestyles\u0026nbspthat could also shorten life expectancy.But analysis of activities mentioned in the report found this accounted for a fraction of the effect.Health news in pictures150 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active350 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.450 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.550 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2350 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2450 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2550 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2650 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2750 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say2850 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed2950 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3050 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3150 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3250 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3350 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3450 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3650 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3750 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).3850 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.3950 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4050 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4150 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4250 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4350 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4550 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4650 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4750 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.4850 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 4950 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.“We found that volunteerism and involvement in social organisations only accounted for a little less than one year of the longevity boost that religious affiliation provided,” said Laura Wallace, the study’s lead author.“There’s still a lot of the benefit of religious affiliation that this can’t explain.”The authors suggested that the remaining life expectancy might be a result of religious people being more likely to abstain from alcohol and drug use and other behaviours that could affect life expectancy – though these were not regularly recorded in obituaries.There also may be a benefit of “stress reducing practices” such as meditation, yoga or prayer, Dr Way added.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it. I can find out more about it. And I can develop certain tools that enable me to combat it.”People without alexithymia could probably use such tools as well. Bird has led work showing that people who are more aware of their own heartbeat are better able to recognise others’ emotions, a crucial first step in being empathetic.He’s planning studies to investigate whether heartbeat training might therefore increase empathy.\u0026nbspThose who want to reduce feelings of stress and anxiety in daily life, but who either can’t or don’t want to change the sources of stress, could focus on changing the signals coming from their bodies instead.Regular physical exercise should dampen down the kinds of bodily signals (from the heart and circulation, for example) that the brain could interpret as being anxious – so it should dampen down feelings of anxiety, too.\u0026nbspKnowing that signals from our bodies underpin our emotions could be empowering for all of us.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen.

Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”In another passage, he describes “bandit-like filthy Levantines” who board his ship during a stop at Port Said, Egypt.“In the harbour, a swarm of rowing boats with screaming and gesticulating Levantines of every shade, who lunge at our ship. As if spewed from hell,” he wrote.Ze’ev Rosenkranz, the book’s editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, told : “I think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant – what he says about the Chinese in particular.“They’re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it’s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They’re more off guard, he didn’t intend them for publication.”In his preface to The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, Mr Rosenkranz says the diaries exhibit a “quirky style” and “acerbic quips” but also contain some “troublesome entries”.“I began to ask myself: how could this humanist icon be the author of such passages?” Mr Rosenkranz writes.He adds it “seems clear that Einstein has bought - to some extent - into the perceived threat of ‘the yellow peril’,” referring to the racist colonial trope that the people of East Asia were a threat to the western world.Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, the\u0026nbspcosmologist, science writer and equality campaigner, said Einstein’s racism was “shocking and disappointing”.Even Einstein couldn\u0027t think of a peace planLegendary physicist Albert Einstein left letters that reveal his thoughts on the relationship between Arabs and JewsThe correspondence also includes a letter from Einstein’s former lover, Betty NeumannDuring the British mandate, Einstein engaged“I am both surprised and not surprised,” she tweeted. “Scientific ‘advance’\u0026nbspreally does not go in tandem with social advances. Sometimes scientific success drags racism along with its interlocutors.”Einstein toured Asia after being invited to speak in Japan shortly after being awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 1921.By contrast to his prejudice against the Chinese, Einstein speaks positively of the Japanese, who he praises as “unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing”.His diaries from the period have previously only been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But protoplanets of this kind cannot be found using those techniques.Though thousands of exoplanets have been discovered in the last few decades, detecting protoplanets is at the frontier of science, said Christophe Pinte of Monash University in Australia and lead author on one of the two papers.The scientists found the planets by looking out for disturbances in the gas-filled disk around the star. They looked for a particular kind of light that is emitted by the movement of carbon monoxide – which allows them to understand how the gas in the disk is churning around.If there were no planets in the disk, then the gas would move with a simple, predictable pattern. But unusual movement would seem to suggest there is some large body there.It would take a relatively massive object, like a planet, to create localized disturbances in this otherwise orderly motion, said Pinte. Our new technique applies this principle to help us understand how planetary systems form.They saw three of those disturbances, each of which is thought to be caused by a different\u0026nbspplanet.There are other potential explanations for the strange data coming back from the star. But the new findings are the strongest evidence yet that there are new worlds forming in our own galactic neighbourhood.The discovery was made by analysing images sent back from highly-powered telescopes pointing deep into the galaxy, in a way never done before.We looked at the localised, small-scale motion of gas in the star\u0027s protoplanetary disc. This entirely new approach could uncover some of the youngest planets in our galaxy, all thanks to the high-resolution images from ALMA, said Richard Teague, an astronomer at the University of Michigan and principal author on the other paper.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

In other cases, staff should be allowed to work from home or work flexibly, either starting or \u0026nbspin order to follow the football, and companies have been directed to “be as flexible as possible with annual leave requests”.TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: “The World Cup is a landmark sporting event. Millions of workers around the UK will want to cheer on their national teams.“Tournaments like this can be a great for building camaraderie at work, with colleagues running sweepstakes and spending time together.”Things you should know if you\u0027re LGBT+ and travelling to the World CupLatest World Cup 2018 news plus latest best pics, video and highlightsWorld Cup 2018 schedule: All the groups, fixtures, times and venues Ms O’Grady, who supports England and Arsenal, added: “It’s important employers do not score an own goal by acting like killjoys. To avoid problems they should try and let people who want to watch the games do so, either at work or at home – and then claim back their time afterwards.“Whether it’s major sporting events like the World Cup or watching your kids take part in their school sports day, allowing people more flexibility in how and when they do their work makes them happier and more productive.

If the result were positive, it would be one of the greatest discoveries in the history of physics.Mr Bueno and his colleague Pablo Cano add: The final part of the gravitational signal detected by these two detectors \u0026ndash what is known as ringdown \u0026ndash corresponds to the last stage of the collision of two black holes, and has the property of completely extinguishing after a short period of time due to the presence of the event horizon.However, if there were no horizon, those oscillations would not disappear completely instead, after a certain time, they would produce a series of \u0027echoes,\u0027 similar to what happens with sound in a well.\u0026ldquoInterestingly, if instead of black holes, we had an ECO, the ringdown could be similar, so we need to determine the presence or absence of the echoes to distinguish the two types of objects."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/183x122/973723_1.jpg","title":"Brexit news EU parliament Gerard Batten euro latest Brexit vote update","story":"                British MEP savages EURO as predictable DISASTER in furious rant                 \u0027Proud to join Soros!\u0027 Crossbench Peer defends bid to THWART Brexit Mr Batten claimed the euro was a \u0026ldquopredictable disaster, as he claimed the EU had failed on economy and security.He said: \u0026ldquoIt has always been about deconstructing nation states and transferring political power to Brussels.\u0026ldquoThat would be bad enough in itself but you have actually made a complete mess of governing the member states.\u0026ldquoThere are two areas in which this is obvious to the ordinary citizen, the economy and security.\u0026ldquoThe creation of the Euro was a political project, not an economic project and was an entirely predictable disaster. \u0026bull EU ParliamentBrexit news: Gerard Batten compared Brexit to a modern peasant revolt\u0026ldquoIt has brought about financial austerity and unemployment.\u0026ldquoThe dead hand of European bureaucracy impedes business and makes it increasingly harder for small businesses to operate to create new jobs and to grow prosperities.\u0026ldquoYour policies have blighted the lives of millions of people.Arch Europhile Guy Verhofstadt has continued his political rivalry with Nigel Farage by accusing the Brexiteer of being a \u0026ldquocheerleader for Russian leader Vladimir Putin.The Belgian MEP shouted across the Strasbourg chamber at his British counterpart, suggesting he was part of a \u0026ldquofifth column inside the European Union trying to destroy the bloc.It\u0027s feared the UK\u0026rsquos transition deal with the European Union will leave the its fishing industry at the EU\u0027s mercy                    PA1 of 7UK fishermen fear the EU will impose laws that shrink British fishing fleets Mr Verhofstadt called for an end to cooperation with nationalist leaders, such as Italy\u0026rsquos Matteo Salvini, in order to protect the EU as it is today.He said: \u0026ldquoInside the European Union we have a fifth column amongst us.

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Endangered not only by parliamentarians who never really accepted the referendum result, but by the Government’s negotiating approach, which risks delivering an exit from the EU which fails to deliver the control Britons voted for.When, on June 23, 2016, 17.4million people went to the polls to vote for Britain to chart a new course for itself outside of the European Union, they would never have imagined that, almost two years on, Parliament would still be debating whether to keep this country as — essentially — a non-voting member of the EU.Or that their government would still not have set out a detailed blueprint for this country’s relationship with the EU once we have left. So what has gone wrong and who is to blame?There are TWO BASIC RULES of negotiation. Know what you want and do not go into a negotiation unless you are prepared to walk away.Theresa May’s government has FAILED BOTH OF THESE TESTS.Even now, the Government can not say what it wants Britain’s customs arrangements with the EU to be after Brexit. Instead, we’ll have to wait for two working groups to report back before the Cabinet makes up its mind.This failure to know what it is trying to achieve has hobbled Britain in these negotiations — and handed the initiative to the hardliners in the European Commission. Mrs May must take the blame for this.She should never have triggered Article 50, the two-year process for leaving the EU, until she had a clear and precise idea of what she wanted the exit deal to look like.It has also meant that, in the absence of clear UK aims, those conducting the negotiations have treated the whole thing as a damage-limitation exercise.As the Brexit Secretary David Davis, who has been sidelined in the talks in favour of the civil servant Olly Robbins, complains in private, the civil service is not suited to negotiating.It struggles to deal with European chief negotiator Michel Barnier’s take-it-or-leave-it tactics.But the biggest mistake has been the failure to rigorously prepare for no deal. Mrs May used to emphasise that “no deal is better than a bad deal”.But she has never followed through on that rhetoric. There has been no big national effort to get this country as ready as it could be to walk away from the talks.There is plenty of blame to go round for this. The Treasury — aided by the Chancellor Philip Hammond — has refused to make planning for no deal a priority.Why? Because it feared if there was a plan for no deal, the Brexiteers would end up using it. Better, it thought, to make minimal preparations for it to ensure the UK stayed at the negotiating table.But this got it ALL WRONG. The best way to avoid no deal was to plan for it. For WEAKNESS IS PROVOCATIVE. The EU looks at how unready Britain is to walk away and turns the screw.Would Michel Barnier’s team feel free to be so dismissive about Britain’s proposals if they thought we might simply walk out of the talks, taking our £39billion divorce payment with us?It is worth remembering that a report from the House of Lords, hardly a hotbed of Brexiteer sentiment, concluded that Britain was under no legal obligation to pay ANYTHING AT ALL to the EU on leaving.The Government risks being left with the most unpalatable of choices: No deal or stay in a customs union with the EU and the European Economic Area, leaving Britain as, effectively, a non-voting member of the EU.Senior EU figures think they can do this because they do not see any serious attempt by the UK to properly prepare for no deal.If this country had made preparations for going it alone that were so big they were visible from the other side of the Channel, the EU would be engaging in the negotiations in a far more constructive manner and Britain would be on course to secure a much better deal.Leave-supporting Cabinet ministers can not escape their share of the blame for this, either.They should have been far more assertive and pushed for serious no deal planning.They should have insisted that Cabinet was updated every fortnight on Britain’s preparedness to walk away without a deal.They should have demanded that the Government had serious and credible contingency plans to deal with disruption to cross-Channel trade. They should have told Mrs May they would resign if Hammond would not provide the funds necessary to make no deal planning a reality.But there is, as the minutes of the Brexit Inner Cabinet’s most recent meeting make clear, another reason why “EU ministers had no fear of no deal”.They “observed the UK Parliament and prominent Remainers, who had formed a cross-party alliance against Brexit, and thought there was no chance of no deal”.Too many MPs voted for a referendum on our EU membership, then were not prepared to genuinely accept the result when they lost. Too many Tories were prepared to stand at last year’s General Election on a manifesto of leaving the single market and the customs union that they were not actually committed to. That is not being straight with the voters.One of the other reasons EU ministers are not worried about no deal is Mrs May’s loss of the Tory majority in that snap election.Ever since Britain voted for Brexit, the EU has feared the emergence of an alternative economic model on its doorstep.It worried Britain might become a hyper-competitive, low-tax economy 26 miles off its coastline.They expected that Britain would respond to no deal by slashing taxes and regulation to make up for the failure to strike a trade deal with the EU. This gave the EU an incentive to come to an agreement with us.But when the Tory majority disappeared, so did this fear. It is clear this hung parliament does not have the stomach for such a course.Indeed, Mr Hammond said in Germany in January that we would change our “economic model” if we could not get a good trade deal, then took that threat off the table in a visit to France the month after the election. He, unhelpfully, told the French press we would keep up the European economic model even after Brexit.The next big British mistake has been its handling of the Irish border issue. The history of Northern Ireland meant this subject needed to be treated with care. A return to every vehicle being stopped would clearly have been a recipe for trouble.But Britain should never have agreed in December that no new physical infrastructure at the border meant there could not even be number plate recognition cameras.The decision to rule these out has made it far harder to use technology to try to solve the border issues and has been grist to the mill of those who want to use Northern Ireland as a device to keep the whole of the UK in a customs union and “high alignment” with the EU and unable to strike comprehensive free-trade deals with other countries.The Government now finds itself urging the EU to accept a UK-wide “backstop” in an attempt to try to get beyond the Irish border issue knowing that the EU will break off trade talks before they have really begun if there is not progress on this.This backstop, though, is not a good deal for the UK. It would see Britain stuck in a customs union with the EU and following all of Brussels’ rules on goods, yet with no say in making them. It would provide a trade solution for goods, where the EU sells £135billion more to us than we do to them, but not for services, where we sell £92billion more to them.In these circumstances, would the EU really be rushing to complete a trade deal with us? Of course not. It would be in their interest to drag things out, knowing that the backstop would remain in place.If the House of Commons votes for the House of Lords amendment to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU or to take no deal off the table, it will weaken Britain’s negotiating position still further.It will make it almost inevitable that the only deal Brussels is prepared to offer Britain would leave this country as, essentially, a non-voting member of the EU.The Government has made many mistakes in its handling of these negotiations. But this is no excuse for Parliament to compound these errors.MPs should reject these amendments today and the House of Lords should respect the will of the elected House of Commons when the bill returns to it.Then, the Government should get its act together.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

He said if you keep quiet I wont hurt you, down on the bed, down on the bed.She presented no threat, a lone woman in an isolated house and yet her hands were secured with plastic ties.They then placed a blanket over her head and asked her if there was jewellery or money in the house.The ties had been applied in such a way that they interfered with her circulation and as a result of being left overnight she has injuries that still impact her day-to-day life, the prosecutor said.He continued: After she had been released, she noticed that some paintings had been taken from the walls and that a safe was missing.In total, 15 paintings were removed as well as expensive jewellery and antiques.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”.

Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries.

So people will stand firm on this”.Tory Brexiteers hit back at the rebels to accuse them of a power grab and trying to rewrite Britain’s constitution.The boss of the hardline European Reform Group Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun: “If they want to mandate the PM to change her position they have to have a vote of confidence and get a new PM.“And that is the long established constitutional position.“I am keen for scrutiny but you need to observe the separation of powers between the executive and legislature.”Energy Minister Claire Perry tried to reassure the Tory rebels to insist Mrs May will not let them down.The minister said: “The Prime Minister is a woman who keeps her word”.As the EU looked on yesterday at the high stakes Commons drama, some of its leaders admitted they were struggling to keep up with its twists and turns.Dutch PM Mark Rutte confessed: “Of course, I’m a keen observer of what happens in London, so yes I’m following the votes.“I try to make sense of it, it’s not always easy.”Tory former minister Anna Soubry said she would also be voting for the EEA amendment.She told the Commons: “I will be voting for the EEA amendment because I believe, as I have said many, many times in this place, of the value of the single market.”Ms Soubry urged MPs to advocate the case for immigration and “suck it up”, saying: “Suck it up: there is no alternative that has been advanced in this place other than the customs union, the single market.“Let’s grab it, let’s do it and move on.”Last night local Tory association chiefs warned of repercussions if MPs defied Theresa May over the Brexit bill.One official in Jonathan Djanogly’s Huntingdon constituency — which voted 53.4 per cent to leave — said their members were torn over his Remainer stance.They described the situation as a “nightmare” saying there had been numerous calls for his deselection while he was branded a “liar” by angry party activists.However, the official said the constituency was split with many members and officials supportive of him after he increased his majority at last year’s General Election.In Heidi Allen’s South Cambridgeshire constituency — which voted 38.4 per cent to Leave — another party official said she was “assured” the MP had done what she “considered to be right” and there was unlikely to be consequences. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasnt meant that she was to die.He added that he deserved to die for what he had done, but a month before the confession both Trail and Boswell posted a video online denying their involvement.Trail and Boswell were quickly named as people of interest in the case and were arrested in late November in Branson, Missouri, on unrelated fraud charges.They have been held in the Saline County jail since then, though the charges in Loofes death werent announced until Monday.Authorities havent suggested a motive for the killing.The Nebraska Attorney Generals office, which is prosecuting the case, said it is considering seeking the death penalty."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004129221971.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"kim jong un north korea sanctions denuclearisation","story":"Mike Pompeo has pushed back on a report from North Korean official state media that said their leader and President Donald Trump had agreed to a step-by-step process.It was interpreted as meaning the Trump would grant concessions to North Korea along the way despite longstanding US insistence that it would not.But Pompeo ruled that out and said Trump has been incredibly clear about the sequencing of the process following the historic meeting earlier this week.Speaking alongside Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono and South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha in Seoul, Pompeo says that were going to get denuclearisation.He says that only then will there be relief from the sanctions.Pompeo also defended the presidents recent tweet about North Korea no longer posing a nuclear threat was made with eyes wide open to the possibility diplomacy could falter.After returning from Singapore yesterday, Trump tweeted that the world can sleep well tonight and that there is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.Pompeo says Trump was referring to the fact that for the first time in history, a US president sat down with a North Korean leader.He said Trump and Jong-un had a blunt conversation about changes needed for North Korea to rejoin the world community.Pompeo also says that Trump was unequivocal with Kim about the need for North Korea to return abductees from Japan seized by the North in the 1970s and 1980s.The three-way meeting comes as US allies and South Korea seek more details about Trumps unprecedented nuclear summit with Kim in Singapore on Tuesday.The historic meeting did mark a reduction in tensions - last year North Korea was conducting nuclear and missile tests and Trump and Kim were trading threats and insults that stoked fears of war.Kim is now promising to work toward a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, but the details of what is sure to be a complex and contentious process have yet to be settled.The Korean War ended in 1953 without a peace treaty, leaving the two sides in a technical state of war.Trump tweeted on Wednesday: Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office.There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.

The party is calling for a \u0026pound350m loan fund to replace dangerous cladding on over 100 privately owned tower blocks to “remove the alibi for private owners who have not made their blocks safe”. The Shadow Housing minister warns that without strict penalties for owners that don’t comply -including seizing blocks with unsafe cladding- then families will continue to be forced to live in unsafe homes. One year on from the fire which killed 72 people remediation work is finally starting to be done on many council and housing association owned blocks, there is little evidence of action on privately-owned buildings. Many private owners claim this is due to the cost.  But under Labour’s scheme private block owners who are unable to fund the replacement of dangerous cladding will be eligible to apply for a repayable loan to cover the costs. Conservative Ministers still don’t know how many privately-owned tower blocks there are in England, the total number of private blocks with dangerous Grenfell-style cladding, though 138 have been found so far, and they refuse to publish data on the number of private blocks that have replaced this cladding. The Tories have also failed to put in place powers to enforce the testing or making safe of suspect private blocks and are letting private building owners pass on the costs to residents.

Notting Hill Genesis chief executive Kate Davies was told to “show some respect” after inviting pals to celebrate her new fashion book on Thursday night - at the same time as a memorial for the 72 who died. Eight residents with Notting Hill Housing, the current trust’s predecessor, died in three Grenfell flats it was using as temporary accommodation last June. Thousands including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will join a memorial walk from 7pm on Thursday near the tower, near the heart of Notting Hill. Ms Davies invited friends to “celebrate” her book with wine, music, networking, and fabric and make-up workshops from 6pm.  Despite being a private event, the launch was due to take place at one of the housing association’s central London offices, a few miles from Grenfell. Notting Hill Genesis confirmed the location - and said Ms Davies was not being charged a room hire fee. Ms Davies\u0027 blog about fashion, which she runs in her spare time between her \u0026pound220,000-a-year job, admitted “I know not everyone can come” adding: “It’s the first anniversary of Grenfell and a number of my friends will be involved in special events in our area.” But urging as many people as possible to come to the “party”, the blog stated: “It is a big day for me and I am very grateful so many have decided to come along.” The Trust defended the “private event” saying it “in no way detracts” from honouring Grenfell victims.  But campaigners who asked to remain anonymous said the timing was “staggering”, “jarring” and “extraordinary”. Kensington MP Emma Dent Coad said: “As a fashion blogger, Kate Davies has a perfect right to launch her book with a party whenever she wishes. “However, as a chief executive of a housing association which owned flats in Grenfell Tower where people died, she should show some respect. “Many local Notting Hill residents are devastated by the anniversary. Her timing is tasteless in the extreme.” Westminster North MP Karen Buck said: “What the chief executive does in her own time is a matter for her. “However, the anniversary of the Grenfell disaster is a very important occasion and, as NHHT tenants died in the fire, I would hope that the organisation is, as a matter of respect, represented at senior level.” Ms Davies’ 220-page book, Making Life More Beautiful, is on sale for \u0026pound14.99 and offers “practical advice on beauty, style and making clothes.” "},{"url":null,"title":"jonestown cult members drank cyanide","story":"NewsJonestown cult ended in mass suicide of 909 as Jim Jones\u0027 devoted followers drank cyanide-laced \"Kool Aid\"WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT Religious cult members of the Peoples Temple died in mass murder-suicide after drinking poison at the urging of their leader, the Reverend Jim Jones, in a secluded South American jungle settlement\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsBySteve Myall17:09, 12 JUN 2018Updated23:16, 12 JUN 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt was supposed to be Utopia. But it ended in a sickening story of violence and death deep in the South American jungle. A cult leader who once preached peace and equality and railed against the violence of the global nuclear arms race now urged his followers towards death. Jim Jones was found shot in the head lying among the bodies of 909 followers - including women and babies. The 1978 mass suicide was the largest ever single loss of American civilian life in a deliberate act, and remained so until the 9/11 terror attacks.  Followers of Peoples Temple Agricultural Project, better known as Jonestown, had committed mass suicide. Earlier other cult members had butchered congressman Leo Ryan, in an act that Jones ordered, after he arrived in north Guyana to investigate claims people had been held against their will. He had met disciples who begged for his help amid lack of food and a dictatorship regime. Jones feared he was about to be exposed and so ordered Ryan\u0027s death, with several of his entourage also killed. The cult leader then set in motion the plans for mass suicide he had long anticipated. He called his adopted son, also called Jim, at the cult HQ in Georgetown, the largest nearby city, and gave him an order with a terrifying secret meaning.  In a new documentary he recalls: In the early evening I went down to the radio room because my father wanted to talk to me. He says, \u0027We\u0027re going to meet Mr. Fraser\u0027. And that was code for committing revolutionary suicide, and \u0027you need to work out how you guys can meet Mr. Fraser in Georgetown\u0027. I\u0027m like, \u0027What the hell is going on, is there something else we can do?\u0027 Then my father went into a rhetoric: \u0027This is the cause that you have to stand up to, our avenging angels will protect us, and prove things right or make justice happen, but we have to meet Mr. Fraser.\u0027 Terrified about what was happening, Jim and his brothers went to the American Embassy to raise the alarm - but it was already too late. Back at the camp Jones had called a large meeting at the town\u0027s pavilion using the speaker system he often gave propaganda laden speeches over. Deadly cocktail  Meanwhile a cocktail of sedatives and cyanide  had been mixed by 30-year-old camp doctor Lawrence Schacht and flavoured with powdered grape juice flavouring.  The phrase Drinking the Kool-Aid was later born from the Jonestown suicides to mean a person or group who goes along with a doomed or dangerous idea because of peer pressure. The assembled were told it was time to die. The first to take the poison were Ruletta Paul and her one-year-old son Robert. A syringe with its needle removed was used to squirt poison into the infant\u0027s mouth, after which Paul squirted another syringe into her own mouth. Jones ordered mothers with babies to take the poison first and it\u0027s been speculated that it was to make adults more willing to die after their children were dead.  One eye-witness stated that while the poison was squirted in some children\u0027s mouths, there was no panic or emotional outburst and the assembled Temple members looked like they were in a trance. This though was contradicted when a 45 minute audio recording - known as the death tape - emerged revealing cries and screams of children. On the tape Jones could be heard ranting: I tell you, I don\u0027t care how many screams you hear, I don\u0027t care how many anguished cries...death is a million times preferable to 10 more days of this life. If you knew what was ahead of you – if you knew what was ahead of you, you\u0027d be glad to be stepping over tonight. Humble beginnings The cult leader had begun as an American evangelical preacher who was certain the Cold War of the 1970s would bring a nuclear bomb. He created a community in San Francisco, California, where he said his followers would be safe from nuclear fallout. Many of his followers were recovering drug addicts from the black community and he seemed to offer a warm welcome at a time when racial divides were strong. But the authorities started to pay extra interest to his community - called the People\u0027s Temple - and there were stories in the press from disaffected former members of the church. Then almost overnight Jones relocated to Guyana, in South America. Followers - to whom he preached about communism, socialism, the US government, the rich, economic equality and ending childhood hunger- believed he had special powers and followed him to the new planned utopia  One member of the cult who survived the massacre with his children, Jerry Parks, recalled a car journey when what he thought at the time was a miracle happened. He said: My son Dale was driving to school with Jim Jones with two or three cars. The lead car which he was in hit a duck and knocked it to the side of the highway. Jim had him pull over, open the door, got out, walked over and picked the duck up in his hand and Dale says he stroked the duck. Miracle He said he was saying something but he didn\u0027t understand what he was saying and all of a sudden the duck jumps up to his feet on the hand and flies away. That is something to this day we don\u0027t understand how to view it, what to think about it, was it real, was the duck alive, would it have happened anyway? We didn\u0027t think that way at the time, because it was too early on with Jim Jones so we believed that it was the real thing. Jerry says now that he never fully bought into Jones\u0027 hyperbole and suspected disaster was on the horizon the moment he landed in South America.  He said: I knew early on that we were going to die over there. He had backed himself into a corner that he couldn\u0027t get out of and it would soon fall in on him. He said we may have to die for this. But he didn\u0027t mean we\u0027re going to grab guns and stand out there and protect ourselves. \u0027You have to die for it\u0027 means we\u0027re gonna kill ourselves before they get us. New start In South America in the baking heat Jones and his followers built a town housing 1,000 - mainly women and children. But it was not to be a peaceful life as quickly his methods of controlling a community containing those who had begun to doubt their mission became increasingly cruel and driven by paranoia. Residents had their passports collected on arrival and any dissent was treated with brutal beatings or menial tasks as punishment. Members of the cult were forced to sign confessions to theft, abuse and terrorism as a sign of loyalty but in reality they were used to keep the members quiet. Former member Joyce Shaw told the Mirror in 1978 that Jones imposed celibacy on members, telling them he was the only heterosexual in the world but slept with both men and women. Shaw, who had been a member in the US, said: I saw beatings and physical abuse. For discipline people were publicly spanked or beaten with thick sticks. A man who confessed to being a homosexual was stripped, beaten with a rubber hose and made to march around to show his welts.  You could see that he could no longer have functioned as a man. Another man who complained about the celibacy rule was forced to perform humiliating acts in public with a woman who vomited over him. That cured his ardour. Little kids who misbehaved had to box each other, so did elderly people. Word began to leak back to the USA that some residents were being held against their will in the community - which was known as Jonestown - and relatives lobbied their elected representatives for help. Paranoia Jones believed the American Government had it in for him and was terrified he would lose control, so he ordered his brainwashed followers to conduct drills in preparation for a mass suicide. Then, in November 1978, Congressman Leo Ryan decided to visit the community after his interest became aroused when the son of a friend who was a member of the cult was found murdered days after saying he wanted to leave. It was to begin the ball rolling towards a tragic conclusion. By the time Ryan arrived on November 14, Jones\u0027 health had declined, according to survivors, and he was abusing LSD, Quaaludes, stimulants and barbiturates. His once sharp speaking voice was slurred, his eyes were glazed and he was increasingly paranoid. Ambush Ryan was initially refused entry to the town but once inside he was treated to a well-rehearsed musical show designed to show all was happy and well. In fact it would later emerge he had told an aide that he planned to report all was well upon his return to the US. Jones, though, had already decided on his deadly course. Inside the camp several unhappy families approached Ryan asking to come with him when he left, but the numbers were still small in relation to the overall population. On the evening of November 18 the departing Ryan party - along with 30 defectors - assembled at the nearby Port Kaituma airstrip to fly back to Georgetown. They had been joined by Temple loyalist Larry Layton despite the concerns of those leaving who did not trust him.  As the party waited at the airstrip a tractor and trailer appeared and hidden gunmen opened fire - Congressman Ryan, two reporters and an NBC cameraman were killed along with defector Patricia Parks, while several other people were also injured. Congressman Ryan was shot more than 20 times. Jerry Parks was at the airstrip when the shooting happened and recalls in a new Investigation: Discover documentary: I had just fastened my seatbelt and was siting right by the window and I heard the guns going off and the bullets flying and all I could think to say was \u0027my God!\u0027 I heard my mom holler \u0027look at Patty\u0027, my wife. I looked back and she was sat slumped over with the top of her head gone. Larry Layton had shot two people inside the plane but when he tried to shoot Jerry\u0027s son Dale, the gun jammed. The gunmen fled after killing the Congressman and the survivors hid in the jungle until help arrived.  Back at the camp Jones used news of Ryan\u0027s death to speed up the mass suicide telling his followers: The Congressman’s dead … please get us some medication. It’s simple, it’s simple, there’s no convulsions with it, it’s just simple, just please get it before it’s too late. The GDF (Guyana Defense Force) will be here. I tell you get moving, get moving, get moving … The poison took just five minutes to kill. When the army arrived they found a scene of unimaginable devastation with bodies littering the ground around the pavilion. A handful of cult members survived by fleeing into the jungle or hiding. Grover Davis, 79, who was partly deaf, missed the announcement to assemble on the loudspeaker, lay down in a ditch, and pretended to be dead. The children A first body count put the death toll at 400. Only when the bodies were moved was it discovered that children and babies had been murdered and their bodies lay hidden beneath the adult corpses. Plastic cups, Flavor Aid packets, and syringes, some with needles and some without, littered the area where the bodies were found. Jones\u0027 body was found with a self inflicted gunshot to the head. At the cult\u0027s headquarters in Georgetown, cult member Sharon Amos cut the throats of two of her own children and then killed herself.

Bike maintenance and accessories  Wheels Before setting off on a cycling trip, there are a number of things you need to check to keep things safe - starting with your wheels. If you haven\u0027t been out on the bike recently then the tyres may have deflated. To test them, inflate them , and check them after a few days. If they\u0027ve deflated, you might have a puncture. A tyre sealant, like Slime Bike Tyre Sealant , \u0026pound9.99, can help to prevent punctures. This liquid is pumped into the tyre to prevent future holes from causing a problem.  If you have a puncture, you\u0027ll need to remove the wheel to repair the puncture using Halfords Puncture Repair Kit , \u0026pound12. If you aren\u0027t sure where to start, Halfords offer a useful video guide to puncture repair . If you\u0027re planning a big family cycling trip then you\u0027ll also want to make sure you have a compact pump with you when you\u0027re out and about. Check out the Bikehut High Pressure Bike Pump (now \u0026pound15, save \u0026pound4). Chain  In the unlikely event that you suffer a broken chain, it\u0027s really worth having a repair kit with you, especially if you\u0027re mountain biking. Check out the Park Tool Mini Chain Brute Tool for just \u0026pound9.98, which is ideal if you need to repair a broken chain on the road. It\u0027s important to use chain oil or lubricant to keep the chain in good working order. The cheapest option is to use cycle oil - costing just \u0026pound4 - but you may choose to opt for a more expensive lubricant like Muc-Off , which is weather resistant. You should clean your chain before applying lubricant - there are special cleaners to help with this. Gears    The best way to keep your gears in check is with regular servicing , but if you do encounter a problem, it\u0027s best not to attempt to fix it yourself. Instead, get an in-store Halfords expert to help you get your gears working again. If your family does a lot of cycling, then taking out a Halfords Bike Care Plan Plan is a worthwhile investment. These plans are a great way to leave the dirty work to someone else, as well as providing peace of mind that your bike is being looked after by Halfords\u0027 highly trained experts. Prices start from \u0026pound15 for kids\u0027 bikes and \u0026pound25 for adult bikes and include free fitting on parts and accessories bought from Halfords, as well as a free Silver Bike Service worth \u0026pound50. Brakes Every bike needs regular checks on its braking system, as you ride it\u0027s inevitable that cables stretch slightly and brake pads can wear down. It\u0027s another good reason to invest in a regular service at Halfords. But you can, and should, test them yourself as well to ensure they stop the wheels. Inspect the brake pads regularly to make sure they’re aligned with the rims.  Bolts    The last step for bike maintenance should be to check the bolts, like those on the wheels, are well tightened. There\u0027s no need to over-tighten, as this can cause problems too, but make sure nuts are all firmly secured. A spanner set or special bike tool will be needed, but the Halfords Basic 6 Piece Allen Key Set is just \u0026pound5.99 and should cover most bike nut sizes. Lights   Make sure there are good lights attached to your bikes in case your cycle ride goes on later than planned! Halfords has a Silicone Light Set for just \u0026pound15 that attaches to pretty much any bike in seconds. If you\u0027re off on a cycling trip, the last thing you\u0027ll want to be doing is carting batteries around, so consider investing in a Rechargeable Bike Light Set, \u0026pound25. They recharge by USB, and feature high, low, and flashing modes. For little cyclists there are also a brightly-coloured Silicone Bike Light available for \u0026pound4 in blue, green and pink for all tastes. Cycling clothing   Like any sport, cycling involves wearing the right kit - both to keep you visible to other road users, and to keep you safe in the event of an accident. A well fitting helmet can seriously reduce the risk of a head injury, so you should get your kids in the habit of wearing one whenever they are out on their bikes. Halfords stock a range of fun designs like Paw Patrol and Disney Princesses , with prices starting at \u0026pound10, while older kids might like the Purple Swirls Kids Bike Helmet which looks cool and offers excellent protection. But the best way to encourage your kids to wear a helmet is to lead by example by wearing one yourself. The HardnutZ Stealth Hi Vis MTB Helmet is a good choice at \u0026pound35 (down from \u0026pound55), and is available in four colours. One of its key advantages is that its highly reflective under street lamps and car headlights.  Being seen is crucial for any cyclist, young or old. Grab a family pack of Halfords Hi Vis Vests for just \u0026pound11.99 and the four vests (two adult-sized and two kid-sized) will make everyone much more visible on the roads. Vests are also available individually .

The mother was accused of not taken him out for an ice cream and not getting his hair to be cut in the way that he liked in a 44-page document written by the social worker. But today a judge ruled the mother and son can be reunited. Mr Justice Mostyn said the social worker\u0027s criticisms were utterly insubstantial and obviously inconsequential. The judge said the social worker had outlined her evidence in a 44-page witness statement which was very long on rhetoric but very short indeed on concrete examples of deficient parenting. He said it was very hard to pin down within the swathes of text what exactly was being said against the woman.  Mr Justice Mostyn has made complaints in a ruling after analysing the boy\u0027s case at a family court hearing in Swansea. The judge said the boy could not be identified but said the social worker worked for Carmarthenshire County Council. A lower-ranking judge had ruled that the boy, now eight, should be taken from his mother\u0027s care and move to live with foster parents. The woman had continued to see the boy so her parenting skills could be assessed. She had then asked Mr Justice Mostyn to allow her son to return home. Carmarthenshire social services bosses had opposed her application. But Mr Justice Mostyn has ruled in her favour. He said the boy should return to his mother and his care be supervised by social services staff.

Teachers want lessons in online safety included in the curriculum. And so Fortnite has become the latest Pied Piper terror for parents who fear their kids are being tempted into a world they have no knowledge or understanding about. Well either that or it’s just the latest craze that’ll come and go in the way a million others have done before, from Rubik’s Cubes and Tamagotchis through to Loom Bands and Slime.  From what I can make out from my kids’ explanations, it’s a kind of Minecraft meets Call Of Duty – a brightly coloured post apocalyptic cartoon world where survivors battle it out (a bit like Love Island, but with greater emotional depth).   My eight-year-old son has played it at friends’ houses and is desperate for it. I’ve told him that is absolutely fine, and I’d be more than happy for him to buy it with his birthday money. When he’s 12. In four years time. Which is, of course, SO UNFAIR. And I’m the MEANEST mum in the WHOLE world. And EVERYONE in his WHOLE class has it apart from him. Fortunately, I like a row. Several times a day. But I totally understand how other parents have crumbled under the pressure of a nagging child and ended up thinking: “What harm can it do?” According to my friends who have given in already, it’s not so much harm as deep frustration and a lot of rows. It clearly is addictive. And it’s not just kids who need lessons about online gaming - it’s parents too. Because tackling this new threat to family life is tough.

More than 170 guests were treated to a no-expense-spared soldier-themed bash - complete with a four-tiered cake, glamorous decor, and an open bar, at a luxury wedding venue. The soiree saw 60 young children tucking into chicken nuggets, cheeseburgers and chips on silver platters, while adults dined on fresh seafood, salmon bagels, hot pork buns and jellied eels, at a cost of \u0026pound2,500. Little Danny changed outfits three times at a cost of \u0026pound500 and Sharon splashed out \u0026pound2,500 on an open bar for all of the parents.

Decorations included golden balloons spelling out Dannyboy across the wall, two twelve-foot balloon models of Queen’s Guard soldiers and a fourteen-foot red and golden balloon wreath. Tot Danny sat in a bespoke rose gold high chair and changed outfits worth \u0026pound500 three times whilst well-wishers dropped off envelopes and gifts into a personalised Royal Mail postbox. Danny’s mum Georgia Moseley, 26, joked: “My birthday parties were never this big! “I don’t even think my wedding would be this much. “But I didn’t have a baby shower or anything so this is the first time that we’re celebrating. “And we’re making lots of memories for the future.”  The event at posh venue That Amazing Place, in Harlow, Essex, was also attended by former The Only Way is Essex star Cara Kilbey, who shared snaps of the party with her 365k Instagram followers. She gushed: “It’s incredible! What a party. The family wanted to celebrate the milestone birthday after doctors’ previously warned that mum Georgia may never have children. She was left fighting for her life and her pelvis was smashed in eight places when she was a passenger in a car crash in October 2008. Sharon said: “Doctors told us to prepare for the worst.”  She developed pneumonia in hospital and had to undergo a eight hour operation to repair her pelvis, and a five hour operation to save her arm. A gynaecologist warned her that she may never have children and Sharon resigned herself to not having a grandchild. And the family struggled after Georgia was then diagnosed with bipolar disorder after the crash. But in 2016, she fell pregnant and Sharon was overjoyed by the good news. She said: “With everything that has been thrown at Georgia, we cannot believe how she has come out of it.  “So I think, there’s a lot of bad stuff going on, and no one does anything nice when people come through something. “You might get people who say ‘oh what a waste of money’, but why not? “We’ve been through hell and things are going well right now.” Georgia said: “I’m so grateful to my mum, she’s amazing. “I knew it was going to be a big party as we know a lot of people. “This is how we do things, we don’t cut any corners! If we’re going to do it, we will do it. “It was an amazing party.”  Sharon said she was inspired by her dad, Terry Green, a famous interior designer for the Rothschild family, to decorate the party in such a lavish fashion. In a survey of 1,000 British parents with children aged eight or under, it was revealed the average parent will spend \u0026pound433.39 on parties and \u0026pound100.06 on presents for other children – every year. In addition, parents also revealed they will pay as much as \u0026pound223.05 on party bags. According to the research, Brits spend almost \u0026pound5,000 on their children’s birthdays throughout their primary school years, including the cost of buying presents for their own children. Brenda Daniels, of luxury themed parties firm Ne Riba Event Styling, which styled the party, says she has seen increased demand for high-end parties for kids.  She said: “The clients I deal with are looking to have the full works. “There is more of a demand these days. It was popular in the States and Australia but I think it’s only starting to pick up a trend here now. “It’s not quite as much as the rest of the world, I think quite a lot of people are used to going to smaller parties. “You can tell by the shock on people’s faces when they walk into the room, and they see the level of detail we’ve gone for.” At least two clients a month will opt for the platinum package, said Brenda, which starts at \u0026pound2,300.

Thursday marks 12 months since a small kitchen fire in the high-rise turned into the most deadly domestic blaze since the Second World War. Locations across the capital are also set to change colour in solidarity with those affected by the tragedy. Downing Street and the London Eye will also change their lights at 00:54, the time the first 999 call was first made. Grenfell Support, which provides help for those affected by the tragedy, tweeted: From 54 minutes past midnight on the 14 June until the 17 June, 12 local high-rise buildings will be illuminated green to pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.  Other council residential housing blocks, including Trellick Tower, will also take part in the moving tribute to Grenfell victims. For the following four evenings, they will be illuminated from 8pm until midnight. The move is just one of the many events organised to mark the commemoration. At 1.30am on Thursday, all 72 names of the victims will be read out at nearby St Clement’s Church.

The unnamed mother, who lives in the Kensington area of Liverpool, spoke out about what she says is the city\u0027s unbearable rat infestation. In the video, a large rat can be seen scuttling over her children\u0027s toys while another appears immobile on the right hand side. The mother said her children\u0027s possessions are being destroyed by the rats and claims the problem has become so bad that she can no longer leave her windows open.  She told the Liverpool Echo : Bouncy castles, balls, basically everything is being destroyed by the rats.   I can\u0027t leave my windows open or the back door as they are running along my back wall daily and I can\u0027t put my washing on the line. Like other residents in the city, she believes a lack of proper bins is to blame. She said: We currently do not have bins and are told to put our rubbish bags out on a Sunday evening. My children are upset and crying every day, they can\u0027t go out into the back yard as I am in fear for them.  It\u0027s making my health a problem as well as I suffer from asthma and when I have my dryer on I\u0027m supposed to leave window or door open as it causes me to have an asthma attack. I\u0027ve lived with this now for three years but the past month it\u0027s gone from bad to extremely worse, my children\u0027s stuff is getting ruined. She added: I don\u0027t want to stay in my own home. It\u0027s 2018, why have we not got bins? Why are the bin men only taking a portion of the rubbish and leaving the majority of it behind? We need this street to be a happy place to live, not a place where we don\u0027t even want to walk to the shop. City Councillor James Noakes said he is taking the multiple complaints of pest infestation seriously and is panning a pest control blitz in certain \u0027hot spot\u0027 areas of the city.

As a child, Mark Baker passed by Gwrych Castle in Conwy, North Wales every day on his way to school. He soon witnessed it falling into a perilous state-of-disrepair and set up the The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust to save the castle at just 11-years-old. Despite joining with the Richard Broyd Charitable Trust with the intent of buying the castle at auction, Mark was still short of the cash needed to complete a sale. The 33-year-old was saved just a day before the auction by last minute funding from the National Heritage Memorial Fund which pledged a final grant of \u0026pound600,000.  The move puts an end to 50 years of uncertainty over the fairytale castle\u0027s future. The three trusts have now bought the castle from Edwards Property Management (EPM) which purchased the ancient castle in 2010 in the hope of creating a hotel development. The Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust will now set out its plans to renovate the castle and its 250 acres of park and woodland.  It is hoped the doors of the main house could eventually be re-opened to visitors as part of a full restoration programme. The castle closed to the public in 1985, though parts have been opened in recent years thanks to work by the trust. Mark described the purchase as a great moment in history for Wales. He added: As a child, I would pass the castle everyday to and from school, and at the age of 11 founded the castle trust.  Now twenty-one years later, we are in a position to purchase and realise that vision. A huge vote of thanks must go to the National Heritage Memorial Fund and the Richard Broyd Charitable Trust for believing in our vision.” Chairman of the NHMF, Sir Peter Luff, added: Gwrych Castle is enchanting, even in its sadly reduced state. The vision of Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust to restore this spectacular building with a rich history and to open it again is inspiring.  All of us at the National Heritage Memorial Fund felt compelled to support their ambition.” Gwrych Castle was built by Lloyd Hesketh Bamford-Hesketh sometime between 1810 and 1822 as a memorial to his mother\u0027s ancestors. It was designed by several prominent architects including CA Busby, George Edmund Street and Thomas Rickman - major figures in the Gothic Revival movement. The frontage stretches for over 1500 feet and features 18 battlemented towers, with expansive views over the parkland towards the Irish Sea.  The main house is believed to have had 120 rooms at one time as well as a spectacular marble staircase designed by arts and crafts architect Detmar Blow in 1914. It was the largest newly built structure of the 19th century and has direct links to the British royal family. Lloyd left the castle to his granddaughter Winifred, Countess of Dundonald in 1894 who in turn left the castle to King George V and his son Edward, the grandfather and uncle of Queen Elizabeth II, in 1924.  It was intended that Gwrych would become the family\u0027s royal residence in Wales, however the gift was refused on the grounds of the economic downturn of the 1920s. The castle was then passed on to the newly disestablished Church in Wales before it was purchased in 1928 by the countess’s estranged husband, Douglas, 12th Earl of Dundonald. During the Second World War, the castle housed 200 Jewish refugee children as part of Operation Kindertransport.

Steve Job has has criticised the council for not giving enough support to separated parents, having tried for years to move from his two-bed maisonette in Longhill, east Hull. The 51-year-old, who works as an auxiliary nurse at Castle Hill Hospital, has had to give the biggest bedroom in his house to his four kids, made up of two 13-year-old twins and two boys aged 12 and 10. The boys spend three nights a week with their dad at his home but, with the twins set to soon become teens, tensions are mounting between the youngsters, Hull Live reports. “It’s a nightmare to be honest and I’m thinking about giving up my bedroom, putting two of them in there and putting up a sofa bed downstairs so I can split the kids up, but then I will have no space, Steve said.  MUM\u0027S HOUSING HELL AS HER COUNCIL HOME IS SO SMALL HER DAUGHTER \u0027HAS TO SLEEP IN A CUPBOARD\u0027         “They are always arguing with each other because there is just no room in their bedroom. “The twins are the eldest and they are getting to stage where adolescence is setting in and they are going to get quite emotional with puberty hitting. “The kids always want to bring their mates round but they just can’t because I haven’t got the space and we don’t even have our own garden for a barbecue. “It sometimes makes me feel down and sometimes I go to work for a rest from the kids. It sounds bad but it is a bit of a sanctuary.” Mr Job says the children are registered with their mother, who also rents a house off Hull City Council, and therefore he is technically registered as a single man, which does not make him a priority when it comes to finding a new property. “When me and my ex split up I registered with the council and got offered this place which I took straight away because I knew it could be waiting months to get anywhere else, he said.  “The kids are registered with their mum so for me and for me to get a house with enough room for the kids they would have to be registered through me. “But if they were, their mum would not have a house so it’s a catch 22. It seems like only one of us can win and I daresay there are thousands of others in my situation. “I’ve looked into privately renting but it’s just not something I can do because they are all out of my price range. “I can’t afford a mortgage either so staying with the council is the only way for me to go.” After five years of struggling to manage his finances and the lack of space within his house, Mr Job is desperate to find a resolution. He has called on Hull City Council to help him and other single parents so they can give their children the best home life possible. “The kids would really benefit from having three bedrooms,” Mr Job said. “I would just like some help and for someone to look at the situation I’m in because at the moment it seems like no one is bothered.

Upon opening the pool, which Claire believed to be a ‘normal’ paddling pool size, she was shocked to find the pool was just the size of her shoe.

Claire, from Leeds, said: “Our other pool at home had broken and I knew that the children would want to play in it in the garden over the summer. “So I went out on a search for a pool and one of the shops on my high-street had this pool in, so I grabbed it and thought nothing of it. “It said on the packaging that it was a paddling pool and it gave me the dimensions, but I honestly just didn’t think to look into it.  “I assumed it would be a ‘normal’ paddling pool size – until I opened the package. “It’s now in the bin and luckily I managed to find the kids another pool that wasn’t pocked sized!” Despite Claire thinking the pricing of the pool was too good to be true, she still didn’t suspect it would be so tiny. However now she claims her mistakes were obvious, and vows to always check the packaging in future.

Swathes of the countryside are \u0026shyabsolutely bereft of any kind of \u0026shycreatures, empty like deserts. We’ll all go out to nature reserves for a day trip – treating them like museums and art galleries. We see lots of life there, but on the way home we drive through the wider countryside where there is nothing left. We’re close to an ecological apocalypse and in some places, it’s already happened.  Yesterday, we read how at least o ne in five mammals in Britain could become extinct due to threats such as disease and loss of habitat.  They’re at risk because of diseases introduced by humans or other animals, or losing habitats such as ancient woodlands again because of humans. Many British species are in \u0026shycritical, precipitous decline. We are in danger of losing some of our best-known birds and animals, even facing the extinction of turtle doves and cuckoos.  A couple of weekends ago I was in my garden – I’ve got a wild flower garden and I’m lucky to live in the countryside, but all that day I didn’t see a single butterfly. Nor have I heard a cuckoo around my home in a very long time and I live in the middle of the New Forest, a national park. One day, I just thought to myself, “Hold on, this isn’t right.” These are creatures that are not only of conservation importance, but of cultural importance. Cuckoos are the symbol of spring, turtle doves are in song The Twelve Days of \u0026shyChristmas. What will it be like when kids are singing, “On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree,” at school and there aren’t any left? It’s not just about me and my birdie mates getting upset about rare birds – we’re talking about our national heritage. For years, I’ve been reciting the statistics such as a 95% decline in turtle doves and 56% decline in yellowhammers, having conversations about the loss of our natural habitats and the loss of species. I can trot these figures out all day, and people have got used to hearing them – but we seem to have forgotten what they actually mean. They mean our countryside is a green and unpleasant land. Aside from grass and crops, there’s not much living there.  When I was younger I could walk out into a very tiny housing estate in Southampton where I grew up as a boy and find 25 different species of butterfly. That was in the 1970s. Now, I go out into a national park even, age 56, and there is nothing there. This is for a multitude of reasons. Climate change, agricultural intensification, building development, road expansion schemes, housing. They are all playing a role. But we can build roads and houses, we can farm the land, and still have wildlife. We still have the ability to fix it. The most important thing is to realise every one of us can make a difference. We can help by feeding our birds, making gardens a better place for wildlife or by \u0026shygettting involved in campaigns to promote the care of our countryside. Caring alone is not enough any more – we’ve got to take action. That’s why I am going on a “Bioblitz” of the UK to conduct an audit of the countryside’s health. This will help measure the rise and fall in numbers of different species in the future. With a team of experts, people who know their area and know the reserve or site we’re visiting, we will cover five sites a day across Scotland, Northern Ireland, England and Wales over 10 days to see how many types of livings things – plants as well as animals – we can clock up as we travel around. It won’t necessarily be the glamorous ones like butterflies, birds and mammals, but all the little creatures too, the flies, spiders, all the stuff that gets overlooked.  On the way we will be visiting and taking a look at road verges, farmland, parks, allotments and community nature reserves. We are doing this because there is a tragedy taking place in our countryside and it’s time we said, “We want our wildlife back!” If our ecosystems become non-functional, the soil won’t produce food, the trees won’t grow and we’ll all be in trouble. Nature reserves are simply not enough. We should all be saying, “This isn’t good enough.” We want young people to be inspired, to get out into nature and connect with it. The most frustrating thing is we have the ability to repair, restore and reinstate these animals. Wildlife should be everywhere, not only in nature reserves. We need to act now, before it is too late.

The fire was still burning. Just as it was dying down to black, acrid smoke, the wind would reignite it. Sheets of burned-out cladding lay in the road. There was no birdsong. The street was alive with people carrying boxes and dragging trolleys of water and blankets as the volunteer-led relief effort unfolded. Walking twice round the police cordon told me there was no one in charge. No one. Just the shattered silhouettes of firefighters going in again and again or resting briefly on the grass, heads in blackened hands. And something else struck you. This was an extraordinary community. The churches, mosques, community centres, everyday people who’d been volunteering all night.  We knew we were looking at a mass grave. “This is mass-murder,” people said. “We died in there because we don’t count. That cladding was put on to make the poorest place in Kensington look nicer for its rich neighbours.” Everyone was talking about resident Ed Daffern’s prophetic blog, that foretold this. As Ed says: “Everything that happened could have been prevented.”  I met a woman asking for news of her sister who had been on the 21st floor. Later, I saw her screaming and knew she had found her answer. That day, children I didn’t yet know were being brought down alive. One was Naila El Guenuni, now 12, who was on the 18th floor and spent weeks in a coma.

Bosses told Ronnie Hawthorn, 47, they couldn\u0027t afford his wages but he could continue working as a volunteer. He was also invited to attend nights out with staff from Waterfront Leisure Centre in Greenock, Inverclyde.  Management have now down a U-turn and apologised to Mr Hawthorn while giving him his job back, the Daily Record reports.   Inverclyde Leisure chief executive Kieron Vango said: “Ronnie is a respected and well thought of employee at Waterfront Leisure Centre. “He prides himself on his role and does a great job. We apologise to Ronnie and his parents for the confusion, which came about after the recent decentralisation of our cleaners. “They are now utilised across all areas… rather than individual areas, to make the best use of our resources and provide the best possible standards for our customers.

She would stuff a ball down her jumper as a pretend bump and spend hours playing happy families, unaware of the cruel fact that she had been born without a womb. At the age of 14 she learned the devastating news that, while she had been gifted with all the maternal instincts, she did not have the means to carry a child. Lolita, 37, says: “I so wanted a baby I felt like I was dying with grief.”  But her sister Linda W\u0026aumlsterlund was determined to help, and when they learned that Sweden was at the forefront of research into womb transplants , she agreed to give Lolita her uterus.  Linda, 42, says: “This was the most perfect gift I could have given.” The world’s first womb transplant was carried out in Sweden in 2013, and Lolita had the operation in March that year. It allowed her to carry a longed-for baby of her own – and that child, Cash-Douglas, will be three on June 27.  Today, he is playing Superman, bossily telling his auntie Linda to let him rescue her. He is the world’s fourth womb transplant baby, and his mum was the first to receive a uterus from a sister. Lolita says: “It’s as if I borrowed a T-shirt from her. I know it sounds crazy. I just hope this will become normal for lots of families in lots of countries now. “It has completely transformed my life. A uterus is an organ you can live without, it is not a heart, but I didn’t feel like a woman. This is a hard journey, there was a lot of pain, tears and worries. But it has been life-saving for me.” Linda, who has four children, says she did not hesitate to give her sister the chance of motherhood, especially as her youngest daughter, Angelina, now 10, was also born without a womb. Hopefully, she will never suffer the depression her aunt did, as Linda and Lolita’s younger sister, Lizette, 36, has already offered to donate her uterus.  Linda says: “I can honestly say I feel more like a woman without my uterus than I did with it. Because I have done something for my sister as a sister, and as a mother for my daughter. I have spoken to women online, some in Britain, who are considering this. I urge them to go for it.” Three British women will, in the next few months, become the first in this country to receive wombs transplanted from their mothers or sisters. They could give birth as early as 2020. And by 2022, the procedure could become available on the NHS. Eleven babies have been born worldwide from 42 transplants undertaken, mostly in Sweden, but also in the US and the Middle East. Lolita, 37, was one of the first to receive a transplant. The nurse, from Norrt\u0026aumllje, near Stockholm, was 14 when she discovered she had Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u0026uumlster-Hauser syndrome, a rare condition which meant she had no womb among other symptoms. She sank into depression. She says: “I had always loved babies, played happy families.” Ironically, Linda had never been particularly maternal, yet got pregnant unplanned at 21. She struggled to tell Lolita, but finally did, in a card asking her to be godmother.  Lolita says: “I was angry, it felt unfair.” She said nothing for two or three months. Linda says: “Finally, she said she had two choices – to turn her back, or welcome my son.” Lolita chose the latter path and was there to support Linda, who in turn vowed to help Lolita become a mother if she possibly could. In 1999, they first saw a report on research into womb donation in Sweden. But it was not until 2011 the family read of it again and made contact with the team, led by Professor Mats Br\u0026aumlnnstr\u0026oumlm. Lolita’s partner Patrik was supportive, and from there the sisters faced a series of physical and psychological tests. Lolita and Patrik had IVF, producing 10 embryos. In March 2013, Linda’s uterus was removed, and sewn into Lolita’s body. Linda says: “They said it could be life-risking. This was an experiment, but they were professionals.” Both sisters endured a painful recovery, but the following month Lolita experienced her first-ever period. Linda laughs as she recalls Lolita calling her in fright. Lolita says: “I had always dreamed of it, but I didn’t like it.”  Five embryos failed, but the sixth was successfully implanted. Lolita says: “I was throwing up, I couldn’t sleep, my stomach was so big, but I couldn’t realise it. I was talking and singing to my baby – but it was finally at the baby shower the reality hit.” Cash-Douglas was delivered by C-section at 37 weeks, weighing 7lbs. Lolita says: “I was a mum, I couldn’t believe it.” When Linda met her nephew, she cried with joy. She says: “I would say to other women, don’t be afraid of doing this. It was just the most lovely thing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"world cup stadium blown up","story":"NewsWorld Cup stadium \u0027blown up\u0027 in new ISIS video depicting catastrophic attack against players and fans in RussiaThe terror group claims it has jihadists in Russia who are planning to carry out attacks during the month-long event\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByChris kitching08:49, 14 JUN 2018Updated09:28, 14 JUN 2018News\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email World Cup players and fans are facing another ISIS terror threat with a new propaganda video depicting a massacre at a stadium where England\u0027s group rivals will play.   The computerised footage shows bombs exploding in and around the Olympic stadium in Sochi as an ISIS drone soars overhead.  The terror group - which issues threats before major sporting events and holidays - claims it has jihadists in Russia who are planning to carry out attacks. The video, released by an ISIS-linked propaganda channel, is the latest in a series of threats by the terrorists, who have also put out a number of mocked-up posters vowing a massacre like never seen before.  Sochi\u0027s waterfront Fisht Olympic stadium, which hosted the 2014 Winter Games, holds almost 48,000 fans. It will host four group stage matches, including Portugal v Spain on Friday night, and Monday\u0027s showdown between Belgium and Panama, who are in Group G with England. It is the venue for one round of 16 match and one quarter-final clash.    This summer\u0027s World Cup - which begins Thursday afternoon - is being staged under a heavy police and military presence to prevent terror attacks, violence or disorder. Russian officials have assured players, fans and others involved in the event that they have taken unprecedented security measures and prepared for a number of possible scenarios - including terror attacks and hostage takings - to keep everyone safe.  Despite being on the run in the Middle East, ISIS and its supporters have repeatedly threatened football players and fans - and vowed revenge on President Vladimir Putin for Russia\u0027s involvement in the war in Syria.   Mocked-up posters depict terrorists armed with assault rifles and wearing combat gear in and around stadiums. One of the sick images shows explosions inside the stadium and the caption: It will be a massacre that has never been seen in history before. Another depicts a masked ISIS executioner standing over Argentina and Barcelona star Lionel Messi on the pitch at Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium, which hosts Thursday\u0027s opening match between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia, and the final on July 15.  The caption reads: So strike them upon the necks and strike from them every fingertip.” Another image takes direct aim at Putin, calling him a disbeliever. That poster features a bearded fighter holding an assault rifle, a packed stadium and smoke from an explosion.  It reads: Putin you disbeliever. You will pay the price for killing Muslims. ISIS has been on the run in the Middle East after being driven out of its strongholds in Iraq and Syria - where Russian forces have backed government troops. Special security regimes are in place at Russia\u0027s World Cup host cities and other venues, including team training bases.

Neil told us that if he thinks young players are good enough he’ll stick them in and he’s done that.“That’s great for us and a great selling point if we’re trying to convince kids to join us rather than somebody else because you can see the pathway.”The former Livi, Coventry and Hibs man has learned plenty – good and bad – from every coach he’s come across but very much plans to be his own man.“I’ve picked up lots from the managers I’ve worked under – Chris Coleman at Coventry was great and so have Paul Hartley and Neil McCann been at Dundee.“I try to get bits and pieces from all the coaches I see, whether it’s good, bad or indifferent, and mould it all into the way I want to coach.“Being able to text guys like Chris Coleman and pick their brains is fantastic.“I’ve also seen some very, very bad things over my career and want to do the opposite!“I’ve got my own take on how I want to go about it and the way I want the game played.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/794603-806x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds 25 mile rule worked for kids under jim mclean but might prove difficult attracting experienced pros","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen Dundee United chairman Mike Martin last week announced the club would restore a historic rule from Jim McLean’s era, it sparked a host of memories for former defender Jackie Copland.\u0026nbspThe ex-Terror, who played for the Tannadice club from 1970-76, was a defensive stalwart under McLean – who brought him to the club from Stranraer after a spell in the juniors with Beith.As a young player, Jackie was subject to McLean’s rule that players must reside in the Tayside area while playing for the club.Something not dissimilar to Martin’s vision of Csaba Laszlo’s squad living within a 25-mile radius of the city.Jackie, who started and finished his football career at boyhood heroes St Mirren, admits the move will have pros and cons for United.“When I first moved up to Dundee it was a rule that you had to stay within the local area,” he said.“The club had a hostel in Broughty Ferry for young players, the likes of Walter Smith stayed there.“He would stay there during the week and travel home to the west at the weekend, like a lot of boys did.“I think it was beneficial as it gave the manager a chance to assess the young players.“It was fine at first but when I became a senior player I wasn’t happy with it.“I spoke to Jim McLean and, eventually, made an agreement that I would travel up with Andy Gray from Glasgow every day.“Trying to get senior players to come through might, obviously, become an issue. However, a few guys like Alan Gordon would travel through from Edinburgh.“It may be difficult, now, to get experienced players to relocate with the commitments they have like young kids and houses – that could cause an issue for Csaba.“That’s before you even get to the problem of fighting other teams financially.”Jackie left the club to re-join the Buddies for a successful period in their history from 1976-1983 before moving into various administration roles at the club.Of the move back, Jackie added: “Initially it worked at United but then it became a bit difficult.“The manager understood that and he was really good about it before I moved to St Mirren.“I always lived locally and followed the team so it felt right to move back at that time.“It’s funny how you get an association with a club and have an affinity with it.“I enjoyed my time at Tannadice as much as I did my spell at St Mirren.“Obviously, I finished my career at St Mirren and became a bit of a club legend but I still miss the Dundee days. I’m coming up in November for a reunion with the 1973/74 Scottish Cup Final team so it will be nice to catch up with everyone.”Of his former sides’ recent history, Jackie has watched United flounder from afar as St Mirren won promotion to the Premiership last season under the now-Sunderland boss Jack Ross.“Dundee United is a great club and I hope it can be restored in the top league because the fans deserve it.“St Mirren were going good. It was nice to see them get back up to the top flight.“Jack did really well and getting an offer like that (to boss Sunderland) nobody could begrudge him taking it.“Hopefully, Alan Stubbs continues the work and does well next season.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united set to win race for defender frans","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are expected to make their sixth signing of the summer in the shape of centre-back Frederic Frans.The former Partick Thistle defender has been the subject of a three-way bid between the Tangerines, the Jags and Ross County.However, United are expected to win that race.The 29-year-old left Firhill in 2016 to return to his native Belgium as captain of his former youth team Lierse SK.This summer he’s a free agent, however, after the Belgian club went bankrupt.And he is expected to arrive at Tannadice over the coming days to try to help the Tangerines to promotion back to the Premiership next season.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee woman claimed 26k in benefits whilst working full time job","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA woman who claimed disability benefits and employment support allowance totalling almost £26,000 while she had a full-time job had sentence deferred.Fiona Roache, or Morrison, of South Baffin Street, told the Department for Work and Pensions she was unfit for work for almost three years, but was working for that whole period.She admitted two charges of claiming benefits she was not entitled to, between November 3 2014 and January 17 last year, at her home address.Sentence was deferred until July 6.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"former dundee keeper malherbe secured move to greek super league","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee squad member Jeremy Malherbe has headed to Greece after signing for Panionios.The French goalkeeper was brought in to cover first-choice Elliott Parish at the start of January after the departure of Scott Bain.However, despite being at the Dark Blues for six months, Malherbe didn’t manage to make a single appearance as Development goalkeeper Calum Ferrie overtook him in the pecking order.The 27-year-old arrived in Dundee after leaving Dinamo Brest in Belarus and now heads for the Greek Super League.Panionios finished in seventh spot in Greece’s top flight last season, only five points off a Europa League place.Malherbe has signed a two-year deal.Meanwhile, the arrival of former Hearts goalie Jack Hamilton this summer may see Ferrie and fellow young keeper Kyle Gourlay head out on loan in the coming season to gain experience.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b1e51507a3be-564x564.jpg ","title":"james mcpake hopes to plunder us for new dundee fc talent","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee are planning to plunder the United States for top young talent to bolster their improving youth set-up.The Dundee Juniors of Central Texas has been a project running since American owner Tim Keyes and managing director John Nelms took control of the club.The set-up in Austin has been steadily growing and Dark Blues coach and former skipper James McPake is out there right now working with the youngsters.Speaking to the Tele, McPake admits he’ll be “outside his comfort zone” as he puts the kids through their paces in the strong Texan sun.He is tasked with heading a training camp over there as well as picking out some players good enough to come across and join his U/18 squad over in Dundee.He said: “Last year I spent some time over here with Tim Keyes and John Nelms just having a look at things.“The club have held camps over here every year, certainly since Tim and John have been at the club.“This time it’s a bit different because it’s an ID camp – I’ll be doing some training sessions and, hopefully, we can pick a couple to come across to Dundee and train with our U/18s.“I went last year just to have a look at what goes on but this time I’ll be coaching.“The facilities are great over there, too, it’s a great place to go to – though I’ll be needing to put on factor 500 with the heat!“We’ll be coaching in about 42 degrees instead of the minus two at Riverside with the wind in your face.”It might seem strange to some to see a whole squad of youngsters all training in Dundee kit in the middle of Texas but McPake is delighted to help “spread the name” of the club as much as possible.“The kids are all kitted out in Dundee gear and they love it,” he added.“Being part of a big club like Dundee is something they really enjoy and the club have done it really well. It’s great for them to have the affiliation but it’s also great for the club to be able to spread the name of Dundee.“You see Celtic and Man U shirts all over so it’s good to see some Dundee ones as well.”McPake accepts this week will be a challenge for him to test his skills as a young coach – particularly his communication skills.“You couldn’t say football, or soccer as they call it, is the biggest sport out here but it is really growing,” he said.“The MLS is getting bigger all the time and the national team has been quite successful, though they’re not at the World Cup this year.“The kids who are starting to choose football as their sport really take it seriously and they are desperate to learn.“I’m really looking forward to it. It is a challenge for me to get the kids to understand what I’m trying to tell them.“It’s the same language – though I struggle to speak English sometimes! – but there’s a lot of different words and sayings.“It will be a wee test for me to get my point across and then see how the players react. I’ll be out of my comfort zone and that’ll be a challenge.“Last year, we went and watched some of the age groups in training and I was really impressed with the standard of players.“As a coach, its great to work with kids like this because they are so keen to learn.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b210da8161c7-846x564.jpg ","title":"john swinney officially opens 27 8m dundee school","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee’s newest secondary school has been officially opened by Deputy First Minister, John Swinney.Mr Swinney, who is also the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Skills, unveiled a plaque to commemorate the opening of Baldragon Academy.Pupils heralded the official opening with a musical performance as part of an hour-long ceremony.Completion of the new school finalises an educational campus for the area including the £8.1 million replacement for Sidlaw View Primary School and Jessie Porter Nursery.Baldragon Academy, which cost £27.8m to build, opened its doors in February this year.Staff and pupils transferred over from the old Baldragon complex at Burn Street.Mr Swinney said he was “delighted” to be at the event, adding: “The excellent partnership working with Dundee City Council, the Scottish Government and Scottish Futures Trust has enabled pupils attending Baldragon Academy to be transferred into state-of-the-art accommodation.”Gregor Murray, city council children and families service convener said: “This impressive replacement for Baldragon Academy shows how we are investing for the future of our young people through an ambitious building programme.“The new school is providing state-of-the-art facilities to meet the challenges that our pupils will face in the years ahead.“The new academy, along with the nursery and primary schools, is a major enhancement of learning and teaching facilities in Dundee.“This campus will provide an inspirational learning environment for pupils ranging in age from nursery children to young people preparing to leave school to take up new opportunities.”The project was led by hub East Central Scotland in partnership with Dundee City Council, Scottish Futures Trust and Robertson.Gary Bushnell, chief executive at hub East Central Scotland, said: “We are proud to have managed the successful delivery of the project from initial design to completion and it’s great to see staff and pupils enjoying their new school.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b210d9581897-788x564.jpg ","title":"masterchef winner unveils as highlight as tickets go on sale for dundee flower and food festival","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the showcase events in the Dundee cultural calendar celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.Tickets for the Flower and Food Festival went on sale on Tuesday, with one hotel boss confident this could be the biggest event in its three-decade history.The council-organised, three-day extravaganza runs from Friday August 31 to Sunday September 2.This year’s festival offers food, celebrity chefs, horticulture, garden designers, crafts and family activities.Culinary highlights will include BBC MasterChef: The Professionals 2016 champion, Gary MacleanChef and gardener Christine Walkden.To celebrate the 30th year, the displays will be showcasing and celebrating Dundee’s cultural and heritage organisations.There will be a gardening event where visitors can take part in a range of talks and demonstrations from some of Scotland’s very best horticulturists.Richard Ellison, a member of the Dundee and Angus Visitor Accommodation Association, and manager of the DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel, said he expected the festival would bring a “significant economic impact” to Dundee.He added: “I could imagine this year being the biggest yet, and this popular event still manages to bring in huge crowds. There’s a real energy around Dundee just now.“What we have found is that with the increased hotel provision in the city, people are booking earlier this year for the festival.

That will be the case here and it\u0027 important that there\u0027 a sense of ownership of citizens in the city.\"He said the aim of the group, which had met 14 times over the last three-and-a-half years, was to create an international-class attraction which drew people to Inverness rather than being something people simply saw when in the Highland capital.LDN Architects will look at the Bridge Street site to help create a masterplan by autumn prior to public consultation. A Highland Council spokeswoman said the local authority would become the landlord of any occupants or tenants.\"There will be no changes to the buildings until consultation has taken place, apart from any minor repairs which a landlord would be responsible for,\" she said.Thursday 14 Jun 2018 10:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111987.jpg","title":"British Empire Medal recipient honoured","story":"\u0026nbspAN Inverness man has been honoured to celebrate 50 years of volunteering with the RAF Association.John Maclean (83), who was born in Inverness but now lives in Peterhead and is chairman of the association\u0027 branch in the town, has been giving up his time to help others since the end of his active service in the 1960s.He also served in a number of senior roles in the organisation, and now his efforts have been recognised after he was awarded the British Empire Medal.Mr Maclean said: \"It\u0027 nice to have your hard work recognised.\"I took out life membership when I was leaving the air force in 1966 and soon after I started volunteering with the association.\"It becomes like a big family.

Funds raised in memory of local schoolboy Hamish Hey (8) will contribute to the process of shaping the links.The Team Hamish charity, established in memory of the young cancer victim, has raised more than \u0026pound50,000. Relatives want residents to share their thoughts at the charity\u0027 own consultation event next Wednesday (7.30-9pm) in the town\u0027 community and arts centre.It is working with the council and the Nairn Improvement Community Enterprise to create a disabled-friendly links recreation area.The council wants to promote use of the links to \"build on the special nature of the area and add to the historic value of the links as a visitor destination\".Consultation already carried out showed strong support for replacing the paddling pool with \"an alternative form of water play\". People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Thursday 14 Jun 2018 10:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04111000/04111982.jpg","title":"Stateside search for market dog answers","story":"\u0026nbspA DETERMINED local historian is hoping a letter to America may finally solve the mystery of a faithful dog that died in a catastrophic fire in Inverness in the late 19th century.Norman Newton has been delving into the poignant tale of the canine superhero that refused to leave the butcher\u0027 shop it was guarding when the inferno destroyed what is now the Victorian Market in June 1889.The story will feature in a trailblazing digital project to be launched by Highland Council at the end of this month, bringing city legends and landmarks to life \u0026ndash but despite extensive research no one has been able to discover the dog\u0027 name.Undeterred, Mr Newton is pinning his last hopes on a Scottish-born woman now living in New York \u0026ndash the great-granddaughter of the butcher who owned the dog.\"She is perhaps the last possibility for more information about the fire and the dog through family stories,\" said Mr Newton, of Blackwell Road, Culloden.\"The rational part of me says it is unlikely.

You have to follow the clues and work out what is going on.\"He has now written to her outlining the story and other details of her family history and is awaiting a reply.From researching the 1901 census, Mr Newton also discovered the dog\u0027 owner was a Gaelic speaker. He speculated the dog might only have responded to Gaelic commands, which would explain why it refused to leave its post when the fire broke out as the owner was not present.If no definitive answer is forthcoming from America, the public will be invited to help name the dog.The council has come up with a shortlist of potential names including Dileas, Gaelic for faithful. Other contenders are Mac, Market Molly and Market Morag.A new plaque at the Market will honour the dog which was the only loss of life in the fire described by the Inverness Courier at the time as the most destructive in 40 years, causing estimated losses of \u0026pound12,000 and leaving families homeless.Thursday 14 Jun 2018 10:40 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

Malkovich, especially since he has a wealth of experience.“I’ve worked with other big actors like Leonardo DiCaprio, but I think what I’m also excited about is that he comes from mostly a theatre background like myself.“He has his own style and he’s also a really nice guy.”One of his recent projects will premiere at the Edinburgh Film Festival on June 22. Calibre is a thriller about two lifelong friends who head up to an isolated Scottish Highlands village for a weekend hunting trip that goes horribly wrong.Ian said: “I am very excited because it was the director and writer, Matt Palmer’s first time doing both.“That’s quite a feat since it is a fantastic screenplay – all shot in Scotland. The scenery is really beautiful and we filmed it in the middle of November so it was absolutely freezing.“The cast is the cream of Scottish talent and throughout the creative process we grew close, like a family.“I think that’s something that will translate really well on screen.”The performer said the film has a worldwide premiere date and he hopes that this will help attract audiences. He added: “I hope it does well since all the actors involved really did it because of the script writing and the subject matter.”Ian was 24 when he fell in love with acting. He went for his first trip to the theatre, a Magic of the Musicals show staged by Limelight Theatre Group at His Majesty’s Theatre.He was so inspired that he walked up to one of the group’s co-founders, John Murray, and told him he would be in his next show.Ian said: “I have no formal training and just went for it.“When I started people would tell me, ‘you know, you’re good at this’.“So I took the plunge and came down to London with very little money and fortunately it all worked out for me.”Ian worked with Limelight and Attic theatre groups in Aberdeen for five years. He then bagged a role in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s revival of Jesus Christ Superstar after performing at the open auditions.Since getting his break, Ian has gone on to work on a films that include Die Another Day, Batman: The Dark Knight, Tommy’s Honour and Les Miserables.More recently he had a role in the ITV series Endeavour, the prequel to the celebrated Inspector Morse.Ian added that one of the films he most enjoyed working on was Sunset Song, based on Lewis Grassic Gibbon’s classic novel of an Aberdeenshire farm girl, in which he played Chae Strachan.It gained a BAFTA Scotland Award for Best Feature Film in 2016.Ian said: “I got to play one of my favourite characters in the film, so it was like coming home.“We filmed in scenic locations like Ballater. It was lovely.”During filming for Die Another Day he spent five weeks in Cadiz and during a fight scene was punched in the face by Pierce Brosnan, who played Bond.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"new north east railway station a step nearer as car park recommended for approval","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPlans for the north-east’s newest railway station could soon take a step forward with the approval of a car park.Aberdeenshire Council has applied to build the new facility which would serve the proposed station in Kintore.The council’s planning department is currently considering a proposal for the new station but a separate application for the car park has been recommended for approval.Members of the Garioch area committee have been asked to give the green light to the facility at a meeting next week.It would provide 168 parking spaces and be near the proposed station north of Kintore.Director of infrastructure services Stephen Archer said: “The site will be accessed from an unclassified road that leads to the B987 (Northern Road).“A new access will be formed into the site at a high point on the western boundary before dropping down into the site toward the parking areas and station entrance.“One hundred and sixty-eight parking spaces are proposed, with these split roughly equally either side of the access road, with 12 disabled spaces near the station entrance.“Eight motorcycle parking spaces, secure cycle parking and electric car parking are all proposed.“A taxi stance for up to eight taxis is proposed and a bus stance for up to three coaches and a bus turning area is to be accommodated within the site.“Pedestrian access will also primarily be taken from the same main site access with a three-metre-wide footpath being formed along the east side of the B987.”Network Rail is looking to build two new platforms.Kintore railway station, which was in operation for 110 years after opening in 1854, would be the first new rail station in the north-east since the £3 million Laurencekirk platforms opened nearly a decade ago.Mr Archer added: “The re-opening of a station at Kintore has been a long standing and much anticipated project. Delivery of the station and car park will be a substantial boost to the town and the immediate area.“The ongoing improvements to the railway network and timetabling will provide a wider and more attractive choice of sustainable travel options.”The committee will meet next Tuesday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"butcher deserves his chance at broch says assistant boss duthie","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFraserburgh assistant manager James Duthie believes new signing Sean Butcher deserves his chance in the Highland League.The Broch have recruited the striker from Junior side Longside.Butcher has penned a two-year deal at Bellslea after he netted over 40 goals for Longside last season.Duthie, pictured below left, and manager Mark Cowie have been aware of his quality for some time and also saw Butcher in their own side after he played a few trial games towards the end of last season.Duthie said: “We watched him a lot throughout last season and had seen him in the Juniors.“He did well and previously when I was manager of Buchanhaven Hearts I had set teams up against him.“He is a player I’ve been aware of and Mark Cowie has been aware of him as well.“Willie West’s dad Charles is the manager of Longside so he was willing to let him come along for a couple of trial games and we really appreciate that.“He played against Cove and did fine and played in a couple of other games.“He scored over 40 goals in the Juniors and his attitude is great so we thought he was worth a chance.“He knows it will be difficult and there is a lot of hard work in front of him to get into the team because we have a lot of good strikers at the club.“But he’s up for the challenge and deserves his opportunity.”Duthie believes Butcher is a good all-round striker and says it’s now up to the attacker to take his opportunity in the Highland League.Duthie added: “He’s got decent movement, his link-up play is good, he’s not too bad in the area and he’s a good finisher.“He has good attributes and we hope to try to make him a better player.“It’s a good opportunity for Sean and it was a good deal for the club because he was at the end of his contract. “So it’s up to him to take his chance.”Butcher will face plenty of competition in the Broch squad.Scott Barbour has returned from Formartine United and Gary Harris, Paul Campbell, Willie West and Graham Johnston will also want to play up front next term.Duthie believes the competition will be good for Butcher andhe can learn from his fellow attackers.He said: “Scott Barbour is back, there’s Paul Campbell, Graham Johnston, Gary Harris, Willie West.“We’ve got a lot of good strikers with experience that will help him adjust to the Highland League.“He’s a hard working lad desperate for the chance and now he’s got it, it’s down to him and us to make the most of it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest.

Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness.

Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”.

owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here in Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoSusan has confirmed that the new Post Office concession will be opening on Wednesday, August 29, at 1pm.\nThe delivery of the news brings an end to a long-running saga to reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

Soon teams from Oban, Islay and Tarbert attended, followed by central-belt squads.CDJFA caters for football in South Kintyre for children aged from three to 18.In February 2012, CDJFA joined Campbeltown Pupils AFC, Campbeltown Soccer Centre and educational football to form Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.It had the simple objective to bring all local football organisations under one umbrella for the first time.In August 2012, CDJFA elected a new committee which agreed to bring the soccer centre and school football under the auspices of CDJFA to avoid duplication of effort and to give children and youths as many opportunities to play football as possible.This also involved signing up to the SFA’s quality mark scheme, providing a coaching framework and a player pathway for children which leads to the  amateur football team Campbeltown Pupils AFC.In early 2013, with nearly 200 youngsters attending CDJFA sessions, it registered Campbeltown Pupils Youth FC with the SYFA and more exchanges home and away started.In August 2013, 2001s, U13s were accepted into the Dunbartonshire Football Development League (DFDL) – the first time a youth team in Campbeltown had played in a national league.In late 2013, CDJFA was awarded the SFA’s quality mark standard award in recognition of its efforts.In January 2015, CDJFA progressed to development status of the SFA’s quality mark scheme.In 2017, two 11-a-side teams were entered into the DFDL at 2005s and 2002s.Tomorrow parents and helpers will assemble at 9am on the Meadows to lay out the pitches.Kick-off for the 2006/07/08/09 seven-a-side age groups is 12.30pm with the 2010/11/12s and girls section at 1pm.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter how dare you laugh","story":"Perhaps you shouldn’t read this. It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Plans put forward by Dears Pharmacy were turned down by Lothian Health Board at a meeting last month.  A three-person Pharmacy Practices Committee (PPC) panel, chaired by East Lothian councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, unanimously refused the application.  The decision notice, published on NHS Lothian\u0026rsquos website, said that there were \u0026ldquono gaps in the existing provision of services within the neighbourhood as the other pharmacies in the area could provide the full range of pharmaceutical services.  For village residents, that means a trip to Gullane or Haddington.  The report adds: \u0026ldquoThe committee also noted that consultations by telephone were offered by one of the pharmacies in the area.  \u0026ldquoIt was also noted that extended hours provision was offered by Asda at The Jewel on the east side of Edinburgh, a distance of only 13 miles.  It also stated that there was a \u0026ldquohigh level of car ownership in the village and that public transport links were \u0026ldquogood, meaning residents could travel to other pharmacies.  However, the decision has been criticised by Dears Pharmacy and East Lothian MSP Iain Gray.  He said: \u0026ldquoI supported the application for a pharmacy, both because there is none in the village and because it could help keep the Post Office.  \u0026ldquoI was very disappointed with the decision to refuse it. I understand that there are laid-down criteria to be followed but in my view they must be wrong because they led to the wrong decision in this case.  \u0026ldquoI remain convinced that the people of Aberlady would benefit from a pharmacy without having to travel to Gullane, and have promised to support the application again if there is an appeal.  \u0026ldquoI will also be writing to the chief pharmacist and NHS Lothian about my concerns that the process is flawed.  Mahyar Nickkho-Amiry, operations director at Dears, confirmed to the Courier they would appeal the decision.  He described the decision as \u0026ldquoactive discrimination against village residents, adding: \u0026ldquoIt is a slap to the people of Aberlady. Because this is an affluent area, people are being forced to drive to Gullane or Haddington, whereas if the village was less affluent they would have stood more of a chance.  He said that had the proposals been approved, the pharmacy would have brought jobs to the village.  Donald Hay, chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, also criticised the decision.  He said: \u0026ldquoCommunity responses were not taken into account and the net result is the village could end up with no banking facilities, no Post Office and no pharmacy.  \u0026ldquoIt makes bleak reading for the village for the future.  The petition has gathered more than 700 signatures online since it was created.  Those who sign are also asked to give reasons online and Gary Hitchen wrote: \u0026ldquoI find it impossible to understand how this can have been refused.  \u0026ldquoThe provision of a pharmacy in Aberlady can only be a good thing and if it also ensures the future of the Post Office that is an added bonus.  \u0026ldquoVillages are being destroyed and turned into commuter satellites by local businesses closing \u0026ndash please don\u0026rsquot let Aberlady be next.

Excluding holidays and weekends, it means that, on average, between eight and 10 food parcels are handed out Monday to Friday by the charity.  The number of three-day emergency food supplies distributed rose by 12 per cent from the previous year.  The figure mirrors what is happening across the UK, which has shown a 13 per cent increase in food parcels given out.  In 2017-2018 benefit changes/delays accounted for 757 East Lothian cases with 1,666 people affected, including 617 children. In addition, 595 cases were referred for emergency food due to being refused a crisis grant, affecting 937 people, of which 253 were under the age of 16.  A total of 31,604 kilos of food was given out last year by the county\u0026rsquos foodbank, with 50,292kgs donated.  Peter Dicker, foodbank manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to provide vital support when it matters most \u0026ndash we\u0026rsquore dedicated to ensuring that people in our community with no money for food are able to access emergency support, and that has only been possible in the last year because of the incredible generosity shown by local people in donating food, time and funds.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray condemned the figures, saying: \u0026ldquoThese shocking figures underline the fact that problems with changes to the benefits system have made a significant contribution to the rise in foodbank referrals.  \u0026ldquoGovernments at Holyrood and Westminster can no longer sit back and accept the ever increasing number of people being forced to use foodbanks.

There are also plans for traffic lights to assist with traffic flows should the need arise.  As many as 350 jobs could be created during the lengthy building period at the site.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Plain clothes police officers joined colleagues in uniform and members of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos community warden team at John Muir Park and Lochend Woods.  John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.  A council spokeswoman confirmed they had and would continue to work closely with police colleagues in \u0026ldquotackling anti-social behaviour in its many forms.  She said: \u0026ldquoThis can involve action being taken against the individuals responsible for the behaviour itself, alongside engagement with parents or s when appropriate.  \u0026ldquoOn the back of operations like the one at Bullet Hill, we also work with colleagues from other council departments to co-ordinate the clean-up of any affected areas so that members of the public can continue to enjoy our open spaces without debris from anti-social behaviour."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/4089089.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=180\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Residents call for change on recycling boxes","story":"              LOCAL residents have urged\u0026nbspEast Lothian Council to ditch recycling boxes for wheelie bins after the local authority produced a video about the\u0026nbsprecycling process.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Riverside was also looking at different options as to how to more effectively manage phone calls at the volume it was receiving, he said.  Mr Beattie said: \"I have encouraged the practice to expedite the introduction of the online appointment booking system, which I feel will have the greatest and quickest effect on the experience of patients contacting the surgery.\"  He also raised the concerns of patients who might have to speak to multiple staff over a period before they were dealt with.  \"Clearly a single point of contact who can immediately direct the patient to the correct destination would be cheaper for the surgery and more efficient and less frustrating for the patient,\" added Mr Beattie."},{"url":null,"title":"Fund in memory of much-missed Jess Mackie helping others","story":"              A MEMORIAL fund set up following the tragic death of a caring 14-year-old girl is on target to reach \u0026pound10,000 raised.  Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.  Len\u0026rsquos brothers James and Thomas were also in active service and James was in the D-Day landings. All three came home.

The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.  Education Scotland will continue to work with East Lothian Council regarding the school\u0026rsquos capacity to improve and will return to carry out another inspection within 18 months."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7898185.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Thousands oppose Dunbar town centre parking charge plans","story":"              MORE than 2,000 people have signed a petition against the idea of parking charges being introduced on Dunbar High Street.  A public consultation looking at potential parking solutions throughout East Lothian came to a close last month.  Meetings and workshops were held throughout the county by East Lothian Council, including one in Dunbar Royal British Legion.  A number of suggestions were put forward, including for a disc parking system where visitors to the busy street would set a disc showing when they had parked.  Another idea being explored is parking charges \u0026ndash but that has met with the opposition of Dunbar Trades\u0026rsquo Association (DTA).  Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

Plans to close Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School were revealed last autumn.  East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Three pupils were invited to return to the racecourse the following day to support an industry roadshow attended by senior executives in the British horseracing industry, racehorse owners and trainers and racecourse managers.  In previous years, racecourse staff have undertaken a number of volunteer activities to support local causes as part of the annual Give and Gain Day, including restoration work at Olivebank Children\u0026rsquos Centre and a beach clean at Fisherrow.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7920185.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Rolls-Royce axing 4 600 jobs amid plans to save   400m a year","story":"              Around 4,600 jobs are being axed at Rolls-Royce in the latest restructuring as the engineering giant looks to slash costs by another \u0026pound400 million a year.  The group said the bulk of these job cuts would affect the UK workforce and would be made over the next two years, with around a third expected by the end of 2018.  Rolls said the overhaul, which follows its announcement in January that it plans to slash\u0026nbspits five operating businesses to three core units, will impact support functions and management, including within engineering.  Chief executive Warren East said: \u0026ldquoWe have made progress in improving our day-to-day operations and strengthening our leadership, and are now turning to reduce the complexity that often slows us down and leads to duplication of effort.  \u0026ldquoIt is never an easy decision to reduce our workforce, but we must create a commercial organisation that is as world-leading as our technologies.  But Rolls insisted it would honour a previous pledge not to impose compulsory redundancies on union-represented staff, including at its sites in Derby, Hucknall and Annesley.  This is the largest reduction in the company\u0026rsquos headcount since 2001, when it announced plans to reduce 5,000 jobs, plus 1,000 contractors, which at the time was around 12% of the workforce.  Overall, Rolls has 55,000 employees worldwide, of whom 26,000 are in the UK, with 15,700 of those in Derby. It employs around 19,400 engineers.  Unite union assistant general secretary Steve Turner said: \u0026ldquoThis announcement will be deeply unsettling for Rolls-Royce workers and their families and could have a dire economic impact on local communities reliant on Roll-Royce jobs.  \u0026ldquoThere is a real danger that Rolls-Royce will cut too deep and too fast with these jobs cuts, which could ultimately damage the smooth running of the company and see vital skills and experience lost.  Rolls said its group-wide revamp will see it shift away from operating with \u0026ldquooverlapping activities between individual business units and a large corporate centre.  It said: \u0026ldquoWe will be significantly reducing the size of our corporate centre to remove the complexity and duplication.  \u0026ldquoA traditionally heavily centralised control culture will be replaced by empowered businesses, in a simpler, leaner structure with much clearer accountabilities.  The restructuring will cost it around \u0026pound500 million \u0026ndash including redundancy costs \u0026ndash over the next three years, but will see it save \u0026pound400 million every year by the end of 2020.  Recent annual figures showed Rolls-Royce returned to profit last year with a pre-tax surplus of \u0026pound4.9 billion, thanks to a \u0026pound2.6 billion accounting boost from the recent strengthening of the pound.  But it has been hit by technical issues with its engines, having uncovered durability problems with hundreds of its Package C Trent 1000 engines and earlier this month revealing further issues with a small number of its Package B Trent 1000 engines.  Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: \u0026ldquoThis is deeply disturbing news for Derby. Despite making a profit of \u0026pound4.9 billion last year, this restructuring means over 4,000 people will lose their jobs, which is of major economic significance both locally and nationally.  \u0026ldquoThere is a real risk that redundancies of this scale will have a detrimental effect not just on the lives of workers and their families but on the future of skills in this much-needed sector and the health of the local economy.  \u0026ldquoToday they must provide significant support for employees and discuss with local leaders in Derby what measures they will take to directly support a reinvigorated local industrial strategy.  \u0026ldquoIt is also imperative that the company honours previous commitments to no compulsory redundancies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7921311.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"E3 round-up  Sequels and remakes dominate gaming show","story":"              The thousands of video game stations on the show floor at E3 have now fired into life, showcasing some of the biggest games due to be released in 2018 and beyond.  Among the wide range of titles currently being previewed are a range of games from well-known series that are returning in either sequel form, a remastering or simply appearing in a new format.  Each will be hoping to please its existing fan base while also appealing to a new audience.  Here\u0026rsquos a look at some of the games looking to do just that.  The urban warfare third-person shooter returns, but with the action now shifting from New York to Washington DC as factions battle to control the US capital.  Much of what made the first game enjoyable is still here \u0026ndash enemy AI remains strong and the pace and intensity of combat flows along nicely as players move through different areas of the open world.  However, one of the main downsides is also still here \u0026ndash the number of shots it takes to put down an enemy is a lot higher than many other shooters \u0026ndash or at least it feels that way.  The third part of the rebooted Tomb Raider origins saga is about Lara Croft becoming the tomb raider she was destined to be.  That means reaching the peak of her skills and abilities, and while that does feel tangent in Shadow\u0026rsquos gameplay, the new game currently feels a lot like the other two in the series, without freshening things up in many obvious ways.  This grittier take on Croft\u0026rsquos story is still engaging, but it needs to do more in order to stay fresh.  Not a sequel or remake but still some household names.  Pokemon on Nintendo Switch is a joyful match made in gaming heaven, and Let\u0026rsquos Go! takes it to a new level in two very simple ways.  The first is that this game is essentially Pokemon Go for the Switch console, even down to using the Joy-Con motion controller to throw Poke Balls in order to catch wild Pokemon.  The second great thing about this game is the alternative to using a Joy-Con, which is the Poke Ball Plus controller, that looks just like the in-game balls and comes with a built-in mini-joystick to enable full control of the game.  It\u0026rsquos simple, charming and really fun to use.  A game that almost always looks incredible is keeping up that record this year with its new British setting.  Taking in the countryside and playing out across all four seasons with weather, lighting and foliage all transforming through the months, Horizon 4 is a complete feast for the eyes.  As driving simulators go it is also still one of the most exciting and pleasing to play with, and a bankable Xbox crowd-pleaser.  One of the surprise announcements of Sony\u0026rsquos E3 showcase, the remake of Resident Evil 2 is off to a very promising start.  The sinister, terrifying atmosphere is still here, as is the classic gameplay and need to land headshots and not waste ammo.  All the while some aspects of gameplay including, how and if zombies respawn, have been subtly tweaked to make the experience a smoother one."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7594767.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Petition over Cockenzie site taken to Holyrood","story":"              PRESSURE has been piled on the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos planning minister as local politicians demanded he reverse a decision to call in plans for the former Cockenzie Power Station site.

That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Cockenzie and Port Seton Gala 2018","story":"              IT WAS a brilliant gala day in Cockenzie and Port Seton today.

If the proposal to East Renfrewshire Council\u0026rsquos planning committee goes through, the project would create more than 365 permanent jobs over the next 30 years, contributing more than \u0026pound74 million to the local economy within that time frame.  Developers have said the \u0026ldquounique development would challenge the perception of what a retirement scheme should be by offering a wide variety of modern facilities to encourage activity and foster a strong community.  The extensive list of facilities would include a clubhouse overlooking a reservoir, a fully equipped gym, spa amenities and various dining options.  The scheme involves an improvement of a previous application that was recommended for approval.

The development comprises 214 one and two-bedroom flats and 38 cottages as well as an 80-bed care home which would be built adjacent to the development, offering extensive care amenities and specialist services, providing 24-hour support to residents.  Among the extensive list of on-site facilities, which will be used by both residents and the wider community, will be: a central two-storey clubhouse, tidal pools, spa facilities, a fitness suite, multi-use spaces for community events, a clinic, a contemporary restaurant, function suites and various shops.  The proposal will incorporate the very latest in information technology to provide the highest standard of support services for residents, said developers.  The project will be the most sustainable of its kind in Scotland, with a district energy centre and heating system to provide the most environmentally-friendly power at the lowest price.  A reservoir on the site dating back to 1850 will be incorporated into the overall development with plans to create walkways around the water feature, which will be stocked with trout for fishing.  Gardens and places to socialise will be a major priority along with the provision of garden sheds and barbecue and picnic areas.

He said: \u0026ldquoNetherplace will be so much than a retirement development - it will create a vibrant new community.  \u0026ldquoBy incorporating the latest thinking, contemporary design features and activities ranging from yoga to fishing, this development aims to reinvent the concept of retirement living in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe believe this project will ultimately reduce the burden on local authority care provision by providing residents with more intermediate care options.  \u0026ldquoThis is an opportunity to create a community in the truest sense of the word and tackle preconceptions of what a retirement development can be.

Popular folklore has it that the last wolf was shot by Sir Ewen Cameron in 1680 in Killiecrankie, Perthshire, in 1680 - long after they had been driven from the lowlands by deforestation.  But in recent years a loud debate has erupted over plans to bring back these top carnivores to the Highlands, and let them run free to prey on the deer herds.  Now scientists say that rewilding the wolf could be more than a pipe dream and that a sustainable population is a possibility, but only if it is kept fenced in.  Researchers from the University of Sussex and the University of Kent, concluded that 80 wolves spread over an area of 1,000 square miles - roughly 24,000 acres - would be required to \"reduce\" deer herds which have been blamed for over-grazing and preventing the return of woodland.    The Scottish Government estimates that there are around 375,000 red deer and 350,000 roe deer living in Scotland, and each year an annual cull has to be held to reduce their numbers.  Dr Christopher Sandom, lecturer in biology at the University of Sussex with a particular interest in rewilding, believes that wolves could be the answer to the problem, and that it is possible to ensure they do not cross paths with people using the land.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspShould wolves be reintroduced to Scotland?  The issue of reintroducing wolves to Scotland has proven controversial in the past, with farmers and landowners saying that they would go after sheep and could even pose a danger to hikers.  But the University study found that the idea was viable if an area was created where their paths would seldom cross with people\u0027s  Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoReintroducing the wolf has long been suggested as part of the solution to large deer populations but there will always be concerns about how wolves interact with people in any rewilding project like this.  \"This research shows that they could actually have an extremely beneficial impact in terms of making the rewilding process more effective.  The research, which also involved scientists from Aarhus University and the University of Oxford (WildCRU), tackled the question of how many wolves would be needed in an area to bring down the number of red deer to allow ecological restoration.  It used computer models to simulate wolves impact on the landscape, and drew on previous studies of areas were the animals had been re-introduced or were already living.    The team\u0026rsquos analyses found that a fence capable of retaining at least 75 per cent of dispersing wolves within the reserve would be optimum in allowing for rapid population growth that could lead to reduced deer numbers, without the risk of having so many predators that the red deer population would be threatened.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservation charity backs bringing back wild carnivores to Scotland\u0027s countryside.  However, it is unlikely any wolves leaving the area would get far if proper procedures were put in place.  In Finland, all wolves leaving an expanding wolf population into a reindeer management area were shot before being able to reproduce, while in the Bia\u0026#322owie\u0026#380a National Park in Poland, surrounding human activity has created a barrier to wolf movement patterns.  Biologists found that the wolf population of Riding Mountain National Park in Canada had limited interbreeding with other wolf populations in nearby protected areas and no successful wolf dispersal from the park had been recorded over several multi-year tracking studies over 40 years.    Dr Sandom said: \u0026ldquoFences are a common but unpopular tool in biodiversity conservation and would ideally be avoided. But where there are conflicting interests, compromise is needed.  \"Fences particularly constrain animal dispersal but as Britain is an island, this is less of a problem. A fenced reserve in Scotland could be a fantastic opportunity to return large predators to Britain, ecologically restore a large part of the Scottish Highlands, and promote tourism.  The researchers suggested that grey wolves, also known as timber wolves, would be the best candidates to be reintroduced in Scotland.\u0026nbsp  A previous experiment in Yellowstone national park in the US found that bringing back wolves to cull deer herds led to forests coming back and more biodiversity. It has since been hailed a major success story.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspLynx should be brought back to roam Scotland  Dr Joseph Bull, lecturer in conservation science at the University of Kent, said: \u0026ldquoWolves are glorious animals, and were originally natives of these shores. The idea of them returning will be thrilling for many people.  \u0026ldquoWhile our model offers insights into what is likely to happen, the crucial next step would be to test these ideas in practice \u0026ndash by creating a reserve, reintroducing wolves, and closely monitoring the system.\u0026nbsp  \"More generally and perhaps counterintuitively, barriers in some form might have a more important role to play in establishing modern wild areas than previously thought\".    Professor David Macdonald, Director of WildCRU and co-author of the study said \u0026ldquoScotland can lead Europe in thinking about how conservation, large fenced reserves and tourism can reframe rural economies.  \"The role of fencing in the conservation of big predators is globally a hot topic. So far our results are just simulations made from the safety of a desk, but they offer a highly original way of thinking about restoring nature and natural processes."},{"url":null,"title":"Pupils from armed forces families    less likely    to go to university","story":"              PUPILS whose families serve in the armed forces are less likely to go to university because of the significant disruption they face at school, campaigners have warned.  A new survey found one in four Scottish pupils from a services background attended at least seven schools as a result of parents being posted to different locations across the UK and beyond.  In one extreme case a pupil had been to 27 different schools between starting nursery and leaving secondary.  As a result of the disruption some 70 per cent said they lacked confidence, 71 per cent had experienced anxiety and 60 per cent said they had found studying difficult.  In addition, one in five said they had experienced difficulties with friendships and 44 per cent said they had felt isolated.  The Royal Caledonian Education Trust (RCET), a 200-year-old charity for armed forces children, said pupils from a military background were one third less likely to go to university than their civilian peers.  Moira Leslie, education manager at RCET, said children from such backgrounds should be considered alongside other groups who face disadvantages when they apply to higher education.  Currently, universities give preferential treatment to pupils from the poorest backgrounds to recognise the impact of poverty on attainment.  Mrs Leslie said: \u0026ldquoNot everyone is affected, but as our survey shows there can be significant disruption to the education of pupils from armed forces families, she said.  \u0026ldquoPupils in this situation can find it difficult to study, particularly if a parent or parents are serving in an active situation or because they are absent.  \u0026ldquoIf pupils have moved between schools they can find it difficult to settle in a new environment and there may be differences in the coursework or teaching they experience.  \u0026ldquoWhere they can also find it difficult is when they have an established group of friends that they have to leave behind and start all over again.  Mrs Leslie said RCET was concerned pupils who would potentially thrive at university were being denied the opportunity.  \u0026ldquoBecause of these experiences they should be encouraged and supported to include that in personal statements when they apply to university.  \u0026ldquoThere should also be a way for universities to identify these applications so they can make allowances.  Five years ago a study of Scottish children who had parents serving in Afghanistan found their levels of stress were particularly high in the build up to their deployment with their worst fears being that their father or mother would be injured or killed.  Academics from City University London, who interviewed more than 50 Scottish pupils, also found they felt apprehensive when their parents were away from home and had difficulty sleeping. Children between the ages of eight and 11 were particularly affected.  The issue was discussed at the Scotland\u0026rsquos Fair Access Conference in Perth, organised by the Scottish Funding Council (SFC).  The event focused on the mental health and wellbeing of college and university students.  A key theme was how to improve support for the increasing number of students with caring responsibilities.  Shirley-Anne Somerville, the Higher Education Secretary, said every student should have an equal chance to fulfil their potential.  \u0026ldquoAs well as supporting access to courses, it is essential colleges and universities provide appropriate support for students\u0026rsquo health and wellbeing, she said.  Luke Humberstone, president of student body NUS Scotland, added: \u0026ldquoWe need to see institutions acknowledging and tackling the barriers that prospective students can face.  Mike Cantlay, chairman of the SFC, said: \u0026ldquoThis important national event will be a catalyst for better understanding and faster progress."},{"url":null,"title":"Councils urged to change their tune on school music fees","story":"              MUSICIANS have held a demonstration in Glasgow\u0026rsquos George Square to protest over cuts to free tuition in schools across the country.  The impromptu orchestra of professional musicians and students played a funeral march to highlight the ongoing battle to stop councils cutting or charging for tuition.  The protest was also held to publicise a Scottish Parliament petition on the issue which has attracted more than 6,500 signatures.  Eleven local authorities across Scotland have increased their music tuition rates in recent times with some families expected to pay more than \u0026pound500 a year.  East Lothian Council has become the latest to introduce charges with parents now facing annual fees of \u0026pound280. Glasgow does not charge families.  The increasing fees have promoted campaigners to warn that music tuition in schools will become the preserve of the well off in future.  John Wallace, chairman of the Music Education Partnership Group, who conducted the orchestra, said there would be a significant impact on the whole of Scotland.  \u0026ldquoWe are here to highlight the fact that Scottish state schools have a world class system.  \u0026ldquoThere is a great deal of support for the petition from professional musicians because this is the route that we all took and if it slides back any more then we all fear for the future.  \u0026ldquoThis is something that Scotland currently does very well and we have evidence in schools across the land with pupil orchestras, but if we continue down the path of cuts and charges then they become very difficult to run.

As consolation for the loss of EU citizenship and the Sewel Convention he\u0026rsquos backing plans for a \u0026ldquoBrexit stability bridge between Portpatrick and Larne in Northern Ireland. One hopes that this is not just to make it easier for the DUP leader, Arlene Foster, to pop across for the odd Orange march.  But we needn\u0026rsquot worry, because Boris is the kiss of death to bridge projects. As London Mayor, he presided over the ill-fated Garden Bridge, which had to be abandoned after spending \u0026pound46 million in fees. He also proposed a 22- mile bridge over the English Channel. This new Brexit bridge is about as likely to happen as Britain getting friction-free access to the European Single Market.  Two years after the referendum and we\u0026rsquore no nearer finding out what Brexit actually means, though just about everyone agrees it will be a disaster. There is a Commons majority in favour of halting this act of national self-harm by giving Westminster the power to seize the reins from Theresa May. But shell-shocked Tory MPs were persuaded yesterday (after \u0026ldquomeaningful concessions that are largely meaningless) that if they didn\u0026rsquot support the PM, Boris would likely replace her, and probably declare war on France. Well, he\u0026rsquos said he wants to emulate Donald Trump\u0026rsquos style of diplomacy.  Meanwhile Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos crew are at sixes and sevens over whether or not to join EFTA/EEA/Customs Union/Single Market/all of the above. Her Majesty\u0026rsquos Opposition will collapse in a heap today in the remaining Commons votes on the Lords amendments. It is surely a first for Britain to have both Government and Opposition utterly clueless about what to do about a major national crisis. The only people who seem to know what they want are in Brussels \u0026ndash maybe we should just hand Brexit over to them.  In a sense, this is happening by default. After this week, Theresa May will press ahead with her proposal for a customs union in all but name \u0026ndash a proposal which Brussels has already rejected as unacceptable to the EU 27. She will also push her \u0026ldquomax fac solution to the Irish Border issue, which is to pretend that there isn\u0026rsquot a border at all. This has also been rejected by Brussels. Michel Barnier has said all along that there can be no \u0026ldquocherry picking of the European Single Market, and that the UK has already agreed that Northern Ireland will remain in regulatory alignment with it. The Boris bridge is partly about halting what he sees as this dastardly EU plan to break up Britain.  But his own Government is doing a very good job of that already. Yesterday it rammed through the objectionable clauses of the EU Withdrawal Bill which effectively abolish Scottish devolution for the next seven years. In that time, Mrs May will have complete power to override Holyrood over important matters like agriculture, food safety, environment and so on. Not only did she brush aside the SNP\u0026rsquos and Labour amendments, the Government didn\u0026rsquot even bother to honour its own promise to come up with an amendment of its own. Not so much a power grab as a smash-and-grab.  So, you\u0026rsquoll have had your devolution. Anyone who believes that, after seven years, normal devolutionary service will resume needs to think again. The UK Government will clearly not allow the Scottish Parliament to reverse any or all of the changes made in the \u0026ldquotransition period, since these are deemed crucial for the functioning of the new, post-Brexit UK internal market. They are for keeps. Moreover, the precedent will be established that Westminster can now over-ride any and all of Scotland\u0026rsquos devolved responsibilities whenever it considers it necessary \u0026ndash which is pretty much all the time. Home rule is over. If Mrs May was trying to make the case for an independent Scotland, she could hardly have done better.  It\u0026rsquos not quite the end of the matter, because the Supreme Court has to rule on the legitimacy of the Continuity Bill passed by Holyrood earlier this year. This is intended to counter the UK Withdrawal Bill by replicating it: by asserting that the repatriated powers continue to reside at Holyrood. Then there is the Legislative Consent Motion which Holyrood has refused to agree for the EU Withdrawal Bill \u0026ndash the first time this has happened since 1999. But the Government clearly hopes to deal with this in the same brusque manner as the Clause 11/15 issue: just bash it through Parliament on a busy news day and hope no one notices. Well, it\u0026rsquos just the Scots, after all, and they\u0026rsquore always causing trouble about something.  And so Scotland is dragged kicking and screaming out of the European Union as part of a new unitary British state in which devolution in the manner of the 1998 Scotland Act has effectively been abolished. Scots will lose their citizenship rights in the EU and the protections that go along with it as well as \u0026ldquothe most powerful devolved parliament in the world. We\u0026rsquoll be out of the single market, and the customs union while Northern Ireland will remain largely within it.  According to Philip Lee, the Tory minister who resigned yesterday over Brexit, the choice for Britain is between \u0026ldquoa bad deal and a cliff edge. That is no choice. There must be a better way. I\u0026rsquove argued against holding a second EU referendum unless public opinion swings dramatically against Brexit. But I\u0026rsquom not sure we can afford to wait much longer, while this hapless Prime Minister, bereft of any plan, damages the national interest.  The obvious course for the UK is to rejoin EFTA, which we founded in 1960 as a rival to the EEC, and then align with the European Economic Area with Norway. This means leaving the European Union but remaining in the single market. This eminently sensible solution is being rejected by a weak Prime Minister at the mercy of a cabal of right-wing Tory revolutionaries bent on Making Britain Great Again. They must be stopped. The only way is to give voters the chance to consign Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos cliff-edge Brexit to the dumpster of his other bright ideas."},{"url":null,"title":"SNP MSP accused of  unreliable  evidence in defamation race case","story":"              COURT evidence given by an SNP MSP under oath has been labelled \u0026ldquounreliable, self-serving and evasive in the closing submission of a \u0026pound100,000 defamation case.

READ MORE:\u0026nbspFormer SNP councillor denies racism in \u0026pound100,000 court case  Ms McCulloch, who the court heard had a 2006 conviction for theft, has defended the case on the grounds of accuracy, fair comment and qualified privilege.  She initially said the conversation was in late May 2015, but it later emerged she and Ms McAnulty were in her car on 20 June.  Steven Bonnar, a current SNP councillor in North Lanarkshire, testified he was in the car on that date with the two women, and heard no racist remarks being made.  After four days of evidence in April, the case resumed - and concluded - yesterday.  The court previously heard Ms McAnulty and Ms McCulloch were on rival sides of a \u0026ldquotoxic turf war within the local SNP, with two camps vying for dominance.  Ms McAnulty was allied to former Coatbridge MP Phil Boswell, who wanted reform, while Ms McCulloch was allied to Mr Lyle, whose group wanted to maintain their grip on power.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspRacism claim challenged in \u0026pound100,000 SNP defamation case  Ms McCulloch emailed the racism complaint from Mr Lyle\u0026rsquos office on 5 February 2016, and it then leaked to the press.  A Daily Record story three days later led to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos suspension by the SNP.  In his submission to Lord Uist, Mr McBrearty said Mr Lyle, who was not present in court, had been a \u0026ldquobit part player.  However he criticised his evidence, including his attempt to \u0026ldquodissociate himself from the feuding, and his claim he knew nothing about the racism complaint for three days, despite his childhood friend and employee sending it from his office.  He said it was \u0026ldquocompletely implausible that Mr Lyle, who previously denied any \u0026ldquoinput to the complaint or giving misleading evidence, had been unaware of it until it appeared in the Record.  Mr McBrearty said the email was part of a targeted campaign against Ms McAnulty that including two other damaging Daily Record stories about her and race in previous weeks.  He said Ms McCulloch could not credibly explain why she emailed 13 people, only three of whom dealt with party discipline, nor explain why she waited until February.  READ MORE: Defender in \u0026pound100,000 SNP defamation case had theft conviction  He called her evidence incredible, untruthful, illogical and absurd.  Mr McBrearty said it would make no sense for Mr Bonnar, who told the court he \u0026ldquoabhors racism, to concoct a story about being in Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos car to help a racist.  Calling his evidence \u0026ldquostraight-forward and compelling, he asked: \u0026ldquoWhy would Mr Bonnar risk everything in giving evidence in support of someone who has made racist statements?  He said it was very difficult to think Mr Bonnar could be mistaken about being in the car, not least because the day in question was the launch of his successful by-election campaign.  However he said some of Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos witnesses, who said Mr Bonnar may have been in a different car, were understandably mistaken in recalling small events from 2015.  Summing up, he invited Lord Uist to find Ms McAnulty did not make the remark attributed to her, and that Ms McCulloch knew the allegation to be untruthful.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSNP MSP Richard Lyle challenged over credibility of court evidence  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos actions could not be defended on the basis of accuracy, or veritas or as qualified privilege to interested parties because they had been so widely circulated or as fair comment, as she stated as fact that Ms McAnulty had made racist remarks.  He suggested compensatory damages be set at \u0026pound100,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch intended the complaint to leak to the press, or would have expected it to leak, causing Ms McAnulty greater damage and upset, or at around \u0026pound40,000 otherwise.  In his submission, Mr Dunlop attacked Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos evidence, saying problems with in it cast doubt on her whole case.  He said that at an SNP meeting in 2012 she was \u0026ldquoheedless of racial sensitivities by questioning whether a senior Asian member, Dr Imtiaz Majid, later an SNP councillor, directed the votes of other Asian members.  He said Ms McAnulty was also prepared to \u0026ldquosully the reputation of other witnesses by accusing them of perjury, fabrication and attempting to pervert the course of justice.  He said her \u0026ldquodemonstrable mendacity\u0026hellip taints her evidence irretrievably.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSturgeon urged to release secret report into crisis-hit \u0027Monklands McMafia\u0027 SNP branch  He said there was a \u0026ldquovery clear lack of motive for Ms McCulloch to act as Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquopolitical assassin, given the two women barely knew each other, other than a \u0026ldquofanciful theory about helping Mr Lyle\u0026rsquos re-election to Holyrood in 2016.  He also said Mr Bonnar had been \u0026ldquolying about being in the car, and that there had been no room in it for him as the back seat was full of campaign materials, and that his evidence conflicted with there being child locks on the back door.  He said it was \u0026ldquoremarkable he had waited \u0026ldquomonths after the Daily Record story about the racism complaint to tell SNP HQ that he had been in the vehicle.  He said the evidence demonstrated convincingly that Mr Bonnar had not been in the car, and that was \u0026ldquofatal to Ms McAnulty\u0026rsquos case.  He said Ms McCulloch\u0026rsquos evidence had been \u0026ldquocredible and \u0026ldquoreliable, and it made no sense for her to concoct a lie about a talk in a car if Mr Bonnar had been there too and could simply contradict her.  Mr McBrearty said that assumed Ms McCulloch was a \u0026ldquogood liar, not a bad one.  He also rejected Mr Dunlop\u0026rsquos assertion that Ms McAnulty made a racist remark in 2012, merely an ambiguous one, and denied she lied under oath in court.

Otherwise damages should be limited to \u0026pound30,000 if Lord Uist accepted Ms McCulloch was responsible for her email reaching the media, or to \u0026pound5000 if he did not.

Scotland\u0026rsquos information watchdog found evidence journalists have been \u0026ldquosignificantly less likely to receive information in previous years, with \u0026ldquounjustifiable, significant delays and disregard for legal timescales.  It comes amid on ongoing row over the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos handling of FoI requests and the involvement of special advisers.  Critics branded the findings \"outrageous\", and accused the SNP of meddling in the FoI process to \"stop bad news happening\".  In a\u0026nbsphumiliating intervention, the Scottish Information Commissioner Daren Fitzhenry called on the Government to end its practice of\u0026nbsptreating journalists, MSPs and political researchers differently \u0026ldquobecause of who or what they are.  His report found: \u0026ldquoJournalists, together with MSPs and political researchers, are expressly made subject to a different process for clearance than other requester groups.  \u0026ldquoThis is inconsistent with the applicant-blind principle of FoI legislation. Their requests are almost invariably subjected to an additional layer of clearance which is likely to delay consideration of the case.  In 2015/16, only 27 per cent of media requests were met with full disclosure, compared with 42 per cent of FoIs submitted by others.  When she took office, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon vowed to lead the most open and accessible government ever.  But Scottish Conservative MSP Adam Tomkins insisted the report \u0026ldquoexposes Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos secret Scotland.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt reveals an SNP government which not only deliberately stands in the way of legally-binding FoI requests made by the media, but goes to great lengths to delay or influence what information is provided.  \u0026ldquoThat is completely contrary to Scotland\u0026rsquos FoI legislation. People will see this report and conclude the SNP government is trying to stop bad news happening, and its woeful performance being publicised, by meddling in this process.  \u0026ldquoThat is outrageous, and all cabinet ministers involved, and indeed the First Minister, have urgent questions to answer.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos parliamentary business manager Rhoda Grant called on Ms Sturgeon to \u0026ldquoaddress the findings of this report and apologise for bending the law to suit her narrow political interests.  Scottish Green MSP Andy Wightman said: \u0026ldquoThis is a damning report, and vindicates the complaints of many journalists and researchers that Scottish ministers are slow and inconsistent in how they release information that the public are entitled to.  Mr Fitzhenry launched his formal investigation at Holyrood\u0027s request after a series of complaints were raised by journalists last year.  He said that by singling journalists and researchers out, SNP ministers were offending the spirit of FoI legislation and potentially damaging trust.  The Scottish Government said it would accept the findings of the report in full, and confirmed\u0026nbspits internal guidance will be updated with immediate effect.  Joe Fitzpatrick, minister for parliamentary business Joe Fitzpatrick, said: \u0026ldquoBeing open and transparent is a priority set out in our current Programme for Government.  \u0026ldquoWe welcomed and cooperated fully with the Scottish Information Commissioner\u0026rsquos review and are happy to accept his recommendations in full to support our continued improvement.  \u0026ldquoAs the report highlights, we have already implemented a number of changes that have resulted in significant improvements to our FoI performance.  \"In the first five months of 2018 we responded to 93 per cent of FoI requests on time, exceeding the 90 per cent target set by the Information Commissioner and a 10% increase on last year.  \u0026ldquoOutside the FoI process, last year the Scottish Government responded to over 5,000 queries from journalists in a matter of hours."},{"url":null,"title":"MSPs demand urgent evidence from Mundell on Brexit","story":"              MSPs have demanded David Mundell appear before them to explain why Westminster has pushed ahead with Brexit legislation in devolved areas without Holyrood\u0026rsquos consent.  The Scottish Parliament\u0026rsquos party constitution committee has asked the Scottish Secretary to give evidence on the resulting \u0026ldquoimplications for the devolution settlement.  In a letter to Mr Mundell, committee convener Bruce Crawford invited him to appear at Holyrood \u0026ldquoas a matter of urgency.  However a Whitehall source said that, although Mr Mundell was willing to appear, it may not before the summer recess, meaning September at the earliest.  It follows Westminster agreeing a controversial \u0026ldquopower grab in the EU Withdrawal Bill, which a majority MSPs refused to endorse in May because it undermined devolution.  The Bill means 24 devolved policy areas being repatriated from Brussels at Brexit will be reserved at Westminster for up to seven years, rather than lying at Holyrood.  The UK Government says the measure is necessary to create UK-wide common frameworks to protect the UK single market through harmonised regulations.  However the Scottish Government has said such frameworks must be agreed by \u0026ldquoconsent, not imposed, something the UK Government has rejected as a veto power.  Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, told BBC Radio Scotland that Mr Mundell \u0026ldquosat back and \u0026ldquodid nothing in the Commons on Tuesday when others were raising the issue.  \u0026ldquoHe should be ashamed of himself.. and ought to resign, he said, adding it was an \u0026ldquoutter disgrace that only 15 minutes was made available to debate the unprecedented situation, and that was hogged by Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  In response, Mr Mundell said the debate time was \u0026ldquounfortunate, but blamed the Labour Party for pursuing numerous unwinnable votes.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt would have been possible to have had much, much more time to debate the issues in question.  \u0026ldquoDavid Lidington took numerous interventions through his period. What would have been much much better would have been to have longer to have had the debate.  \u0026ldquoThe way of achieving that was for Labour not to pursue everything to a vote.  When it was pointed out the parliamentary timetable was set by the Government, not the opposition, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquopeople knew exactly how much time was available.  \u0026ldquoThe Labour Party knew exactly how much time there would be left to debate these issues if they took every single vote, which is what they did, and I think that\u0026rsquos very regrettable.  \u0026ldquoEven if we had had 100 hours of debate the outcome wouldn\u0026rsquot have changed because the SNP and Scottish Government position is exactly the same as it was on day one of this Bill.  Asked to characterise his handling of the matter, including an absence of previously promised amendments, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos now quite clear that it was never going to be possible to get agreed amendments because Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government have a different view of devolution from everyone else.  Asked if he had considered resigning, Mr Mundell replied: \u0026ldquoI consider that what I have done is stood up for the constitutional settlement that people voted for in 2014.  \u0026ldquoIan Blackford, Nicola Sturgeon, the SNP, don\u0026rsquot like that settlement, don\u0026rsquot support it.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to apologise for standing up for the settlement people voted for.  However he refused to say whether he had considered his position.  Mr Mundell has frequently given evidence to various Holyrood committees about Brexit.  He is due to appear before the Justice Committee on Thursday to discuss cross-border legal disputes and criminal justice co-operation between Scotland and the EU post-Brexit."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7919182.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Watch  Ian Blackford leads dramatic SNP walk-out from Commons","story":"              THE SNP has staged a dramatic walk-out in the House of Commons after Ian Blackford its Westminster leader defied the Speaker, insisting the UK Government had shown total disrespect and discourtesy to Scotland by its actions over the Brexit Bill.  The Conservatives, he later suggested, had returned to the days of Margaret Thatcher and were acting in an \u0026ldquoanti-Scottish way.  In developments that stunned MPs during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, the Nationalist leader attacked the Conservative Government, which he said was implementing, through its legislation, a power-grab against Holyrood and had not even given Scottish MPs the chance to debate it during Tuesday\u0026rsquos consideration of the Bill.    Using a rare parliamentary device, he called for a \u0026ldquoprivate sitting of Parliament, which would have removed the public from the chamber\u0026rsquos gallery.  The move appeared to take John Bercow, the Speaker, Theresa May, and others totally by surprise.  As the chamber descended into confusion, Mr Bercow hurriedly consulted the Commons lawyers and suggested a vote on Mr Blackford\u0026rsquos request be taken after PMQs. But the Highland MP insisted he wanted an immediate vote, declaring: \u0026ldquoI beg to move.  At which point as Nationalist MPs cheered, Opposition MPs jeered. The Speaker took more advice, repeating that the vote should take place at the end of PMQs. \u0026ldquoThat is the end of the matter, declared Mr Bercow, calling the PM to respond.  But Mr Blackford continued to stand as the Speaker urged him amid the roar of the chamber to sit down, insisting: \u0026ldquoNo, you\u0026rsquore not moving anything.    As the volume in the chamber rose further on all sides, Labour frontbenchers were engaged in hurried private conversations.  As the Speaker again insisted a vote could take place at the end of PMQs, SNP backbencher David Linden shouted: \u0026ldquoNow!  Mr Bercow responded by telling the Glasgow MP: \u0026ldquoI say to you in the kindest possible spirit, don\u0026rsquot tell me what the procedures of this House are. I\u0026rsquom telling you there can be a vote at the end of this session and not now.  As Mr Blackford rose again to applause from some of his SNP colleagues, the Speaker shouted: \u0026ldquoOrder. Resume your seat Mr Blackford! He then said in light of the party leader\u0026rsquos refusal to resume his seat, he ordered him to leave the chamber immediately.  At first, the Highland MP did not go. As MPs continued to shout, Mr Bercow could he heard saying to colleagues: \u0026ldquoHe won\u0026rsquot, so we\u0026rsquoll have to have the vote.  At one point, Joanna Cherry, the Nationalist MP, could be seen shouting at the Tory benches before Mr Blackford dramatically walked out followed by his SNP colleagues. Ms Cherry as she left waved to the Speaker, saying: \u0026ldquoGoodbye.  As the noise level began to subside, Mr Bercow said it was a pity as Nationalist MPs had questions down on the Order Paper.                         .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default .vjs-tech { position: static !important }                       .bc-player-rkgvgWjWCG_default { height: auto !important width: 100% !important}                       .vjs-playlist-description { display: none }                       .vjs-big-play-button { top: 0pxleft: 0pxright: 0pxbottom: 0pxmargin: auto }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist { background-color: #f7f4f1color: #000min-width: auto }                       .vjs-playlist cite { overflow: initialtext-overflow: initialwhite-space: initialfont-weight: 600font-size: 16px }                       .vjs-mouse.vjs-playlist time { color: #fff }                       cite.vjs-playlist-name { text-align: left }                       .story-credits { margin-top: 20px }                       #liveMultiHide .vjs-dock-description { display: none }                       .vjs-playlist-thumbnail { margin-right: 10px !IMPORTANT }                        /* Style the overlay */                        /* Hide the overlay */                        .hide-countdown {                            display: none                        }                        .hide-overlay {                            display: none                        }                        /* Style the overlay */                        .vjs-overlay,                        .vjs-overlay.vjs-overlay-top {                            position: absolute                            top: 0px                            left: 0px                        }                        .vjs-overlay p {                            width: 100px                            background-color: #000000                            color: #fff                            padding: 10px                            margin: 0                            margin-bottom: 0                            border-radius: 0px                            text-align: left                        }                                               width=\"100%\"                            data-account=\"64298557001\"                            data-player=\"rkgvgWjWCG\"                            data-embed=\"default\"                            data-video-id=\"5797134990001\"                            class=\"video-js\"                            playsinline                            data-random-id=\"1600112127\"                            controls  Earlier, in Commons exchanges, the SNP leader had pointed out that despite the declaration that Scotland would be a partner of equals in the UK, the Tory Government had pressed ahead with a \u0026ldquopower-grab in direct opposition to Scotland\u0026rsquos Parliament and had \u0026ldquosilenced Scotland\u0026rsquos voice.  He claimed that the PM and her colleagues had broken constitutional convention and \u0026ldquoplunged Scotland into a constitutional crisis.  He called on her to bring forward emergency legislation so that the \u0026ldquowill of the Scottish Parliament can be heard and, more importantly be respected.    Mrs May stressed how the outcome of the Brexit process would increase Holyrood\u0026rsquos powers in 80 areas, declaring: \u0026ldquoIt is not the case that this is in any way a power-grab. She went on: \u0026ldquoOnly the SNP could say that getting 80 more areas where they are going to take decisions was a power-grab.  Pointing to how there was just 15 minutes on Tuesday night for debate on the Scottish clause to the EU Withdrawal Bill, the PM blamed Labour for using \u0026ldquoprocedural manoeuvres in calling unnecessary votes.  Mr Blackford replied that the reality was powers enshrined under the 1998 Scotland Act were being \u0026ldquograbbed back by Whitehall and Scottish MPs were \u0026ldquonot given the courtesy of even debating it last night it\u0026rsquos a democratic outrage. The people of Scotland will not be disrespected by this Parliament.  Outside the chamber, the MP for Ross, Skye and Lochaber said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not prepared to stand back and see Westminster engage in a power-grab against the Scottish Parliament and to do so on a basis that Scotland\u0026rsquos parliamentarians have not been given the opportunity to debate what this Parliament is doing. It\u0026rsquos an outrage.  He went on: \u0026ldquoWe are going to make sure we will be robust in using parliamentary devices to make sure we can hold this Government to account. We are in a situation that the Westminster Government has shown utter disrespect to the Scottish Parliament and the people of Scotland by wilfully ignoring that the fact that the Scottish Parliament has refused to give a consent motion.    \u0026ldquoThey are now acting outwith the support of the Scottish people. The Conservatives have returned to where they were before in acting in a manner that is anti-Scottish. We are not having it.  But Scottish Conservative MP Kirstene Hair decried the SNP\u0026rsquos actions.  \"This rehearsed move just demonstrated that the SNP care more about headlines than actually achieving anything for Scotland.  \"They are the masters of manufactured grievance and the people of Scotland are sick of it.  \"The SNP have played games with the constitution, played games with Brexit and now are playing games with Parliament. It is a joke, added the Angus MP.  Meanwhile in the chamber, Mr Bercow at the end of PMqs looked up and praised a baby in the public gallery, who, he said, had been \"a model of impeccable behaviour\" despite the \"turbulence\" of the proceedings."},{"url":null,"title":"Gin festival  Michael McIntyre - and 9 other things to do in Glasgow this weekend","story":"              Michael McIntyreSSE Hydro, Glasgow, today until Saturday  The hugely-popular comedian\u0026rsquos back with his trademark ability to turn everyday situations into masterclasses of human exasperation.

Calls were made for museums to stay open late into the evening and for cinemas to show films into the early hours of the morning.  People also want to see takeaway hours extended through the night so they can pick up a meal until 5am.  But while habits are changing, the report found that only a quarter of UK hospitality and leisure businesses recognise this growing demand, and said that opening hours are not keeping up with changes to modern working lives.    Jamie Grant, Head of Corporate Banking for Barclays in Scotland, believes that businesses were losing out by not responding to the dawning of 24-hour culture.  He said: \u0026ldquoAdapting to the changing consumer demand presents a substantial opportunity for Scottish businesses.\u0026nbsp  \"Our research has shown that leisure operators across the country could access a staggering \u0026pound6.75bn per annum by accommodating their customers\u0026rsquo evolving needs which have been brought on by changing working patterns.\u0026nbsp  \"While that may be a challenge for some providers, understanding the value of the opportunity makes the prize more tangible.\"\u0026nbsp  The new Barclays Corporate Banking Hospitality and Leisure report, Open All Hours? found that only a quarter of Scots now work traditional 9-5 hours, with nearly a one-in-five saying they need different opening hours.\u0026nbsp  More than one in ten Scots now expect hospitality services to be available 24-hours, and may be disappointed if they aren\u0027t.\u0026nbsp  The study concluded that by responding to this demand, Scotland\u0026rsquos restaurants could benefit by \u0026pound126m each year, takeaways by \u0026pound144m, and pubs, bars and clubs could benefit the most by accessing a market worth almost \u0026pound100 million each.  One sector identified to be rising to the challenge of changing work patterns the country\u0027s gyms, with some allowing PIN-controlled access systems, smart lighting, temperature controls and extensive video monitoring to overcome the staffing issues that deter some businesses from after-hours opening.\u0026nbsp    Mr Grant added: \u0026ldquoThe current leisure environment does present a number of challenges for the sector\u0026rsquos businesses the labour supply is challenged by Brexit, rent increases and food inflation are all set within the context of an incredibly competitive market which is already heavily discounting. \u0026nbsp  \"However, those that don\u0026rsquot adapt to this type of newly developing consumer demand risk being left behind and in this ever-competitive environment, businesses need to weigh up the value of the long-term opportunity over the cost of the short-term investment.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  is clogged with roads  traffic and pollution ","story":"              It is universally known as the Dear Green Place due to the number of parks and open spaces where the residents could enjoy some leisure time.  But a new report has revealed that Glasgow has more space given up to roads than any other major UK city and is suffering amongst the worst congestion as a result.  The report claims the city is in danger  of being strangled by too many roads clogged with slow-moving vehicles, choked by high levels of pollution and bereft of  city-centre residents.  As a result, it warns Glasgow is in danger of sliding behind rival cities in its ability to compete for jobs, investment and visitors.  Early findings from the Glasgow Connectivity Commission says there is a need to drastically \u0026ldquorewire the city\u0026rsquos transport system which sees city-centre buses crawl at an average of just 4.5mph and fails to meet the needs of destinations such as Glasgow Airport and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.  The report, which has been looking at how to support economic growth by enabling more people to live, work and visit the city, claims Glasgow is already straggling behind its rivals with too many commuters travelling from the suburbs adding to congestion and pollution, and too few people living in the city\u0026rsquos centre.  It warns other cities which have boosted the number of inner city residents had gone on to see economic investment and jobs increase. A key problem, according to the report, is Glasgow\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogrid system layout which it says hands significantly more space over to roads than other UK cities, despite it having one of the lowest car ownership levels.  Some 25 per cent of land in the city centre is covered by roads, while pavements take up just eight per cent.  In Edinburgh, however, there is a more equal balance, with roads using just 12% of space, while pavements have 10%.  The commission\u0026rsquos report also points to a rise in goods vehicles \u0026ndash such as home delivery services \u0026ndash and private-hire taxis which could be adding to congestion problems.  The independent commission was established by Glasgow Council leader Susan Aitken with a remit to rethink the city centre as a business, retail and leisure destination.  It is spearheaded by former government transport adviser Professor David Begg.  He said: \u0026ldquoA generation ago Glasgow  led the way across the UK towards  what was seen as a modernised transport system built for the car.  \u0026ldquoNow, with rapidly changing demands and a trend towards low-carbon infrastructure, the priorities of people have changed quite dramatically.  \u0026ldquoThe dominance of the road is being questioned not only in social terms  with its negative impact on air quality and road safety, but also economically as its rival European cities transform their environments in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and integrated public transport.  It pointed to a dramatic decline in bus use which has seen passenger numbers slump by 40% in the past decade. In the past four years, First Bus has lost 27 million passengers \u0026ndash a markedly worse decline than any other UK city.  Despite the introduction of cycle lanes and better walkways, evidence to the commission from SPT had shown  journeys by bike had increased by 3%  in the decade to 2016, and the proportion of journeys on foot had fallen from  15% to 11%.  The findings pointed to research that showed large increases in city-centre employment in Manchester and Leeds occurring at the same time as a population boom. Many new residents were young professionals attracted by job prospects and amenities.  Ms Aitken said: \u0026ldquoDavid Begg\u0026rsquos expertise and knowledge speaks for itself. I gave him and his commissioners a very broad remit \u0026ndash linked to improving the city centre experience supporting the local economy, and ensuring all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos people can share in the prosperity it creates.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pleased to see them really take that challenge on and it is clear the commission has already gathered some very significant and sometimes uncomfortable evidence.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to try to second-guess what their final recommendations are going to be, but I\u0026rsquom convinced they will present a healthy challenge to the city and to members of all parties on the council.  The commission will produce its final report and recommendations in November."},{"url":null,"title":"animal welfare charity welcomes new addition","story":"\t\tA foal has been born at the Scottish SPCA\u0027s Aberdeen Animal Rescue and Rehoming Centre.\t\t\t\tScotland’s animal welfare charity welcomed the healthy colt into the world at 7.30am yesterday (Tuesday, June 12).

However, solicitors for the claimants have not yet received all the money from RBS and only about £25million has been paid to investors so far.
