Donald Trump? Who cared? He was just The Apprentice then,\u0027  photographer Keith Munyan, one of her close friends, said.Trump has always denied having sex with Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. At the time of their alleged encounter, he had been married to the first lady for a year. Last week, his long serving lawyer flipped on him and admitted paying Daniels $130,000 to keep her allegations to herself ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen admitted making a similar arrangement with former playmate Karen McDougal.   \u0027It was just normal person sex,\u0027 Daniels said of her alleged tryst with the president in 2006. Trump (pictured together at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament were they met) denies they ever slept togetherFor months, Trump said he did not know about the payments. In his plea, Cohen claimed the opposite and said he acted under Trump\u0027s instruction. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in doing so, among other criminal charges, and is now facing jail time. Daniels gloated on Twitter after his plea. She later told Vogue: \u0027Michael and I are vindicated, and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong.\u0027 Her in-person interview  was completed months earlier when her fight against the president and his lawyer was still uncertain but others interviewed for it said they all knew about the payment and laughed at Daniels for not taking more money.\u0027We made fun of her because she took so little money,\u0027 Kelli Roberts who worked with Daniels in the porn industry, said. Roberts later said Daniels \u0027stood out\u0027 from others when she was in charge of porn shoots in the 1990s because she would \u0027rent mansions for the day\u0027 and \u0027bring bottled water and doughnuts to make the girls feel comfortable.\u0027 Daniel complained that she was living like a \u0027fugitive\u0027 with paparazzi camped outside her home in Texas if she ever stayed put for long enough. \u0027We’ve been in a couple car chases. We’ve had people put notes under the door, which means they know what hotel I’m in, which means we\u0027ve had to change hotels in the middle of the night,\u0027 she said, referring to herself and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.                             My fan base is completely different. It\u0027s pretty much these packs of women and they\u0027re like, You\u0027re going to save the world.                         \u0027We’ve been at restaurants when we order food and it’s taken too long or somebody was watching and we’ve had to leave—like that. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so skinny,\u0027 she went on. Avenatti was also photographed by Leibowitz for the interview. The pair jokingly referred to themselves as Thelma and Louise at one stage.\u0027Do you want to be Thelma or Louise, Michael?\u0027 she asked.  Avenatti replied: \u0027Who\u0027s driving the car?\u0027 Their exchange went on with Daniels asking, \u0027Yeah, who decided to go off the cliff?\u0027 When the Vogue writer interjected that it had been Thelma, Avenatti carried on: \u0027But was she driving?\u0027 After being told that she wasn\u0027t, he said: \u0027I want to be Louise.\u0027 Daniels, at that, said: \u0027Which one of us gets Brad Pitt?\u0027 Elsewhere, Avenatti described her as \u0027really f****** smart\u0027. After Cohen\u0027s plea last week, he told the magazine in an email: \u0027Trump is in a lot of trouble. His habit of disloyalty and stepping on people is about to catch up to him.\u0027 The interview also happened before Daniels was arrested in Ohio during one of her strip shows. She was accused of inappropriately touching patrons by slapping their faces with her bare breasts. Avenatti fought the charges successfully and they were dropped. Since she began her Make America Horny Again tour of strip clubs, Daniels said she has been faced with an unexpected outpouring of admiration from women who are pinning their hopes for a \u0027revolution\u0027 on her, their unlikely leader. \u0027My fan base is completely different. It’s pretty much these packs of women, and they are angry. People come up and they’re so emotional and they put so much on me. They’re like, You’re going to save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a hero. \u0027When I started this, I just wanted to save my own a**. Not everybody else\u0027s,\u0027 she said.She also touched on her estranged relationship from her mother which had been well documented in previous interviews and said her upbringing was \u0027neglectful\u0027.  \u0027I haven’t talked to my mom in over ten years and I haven’t talked to my dad in 22 years,\u0027 she said, adding that she grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convinced that she had been adopted from a rich family because she felt so out of place with her own relatives.                             She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine                        \u0027My mom lives in a house that has a boat in the front yard that hasn’t seen water since 1982, and she’s content to just sit there and chain-smoke, and I just couldn’t be like that,\u0027 she said. She later said: \u0027I learned all my early life skills from the strippers at that first club I worked.\u0027 After her Ohio arrest, Daniels\u0027 third husband filed for orce and asked for full custody of their seven-year-old daughter. In the Vogue interview, she spoke candidly about her child and how much she knows about her battle with the president. \u0027She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine. \u0027The problem is they keep using the words, porn star, and she doesn’t know what a porn star is, because she doesn’t know what sex is, and I’m not quite ready to have that conversation,\u0027 she said. Her daughter has been with her father over the last several months while she tours the country. The pair have limited contact and Daniels must wait for her to call her because the child gets too upset whenever she gets in touch unexpectedly, she said. \u0027If I contact her, it makes her sad, so I just kind of have to wait until she wants to talk to me,\u0027 she said. She was forced to pull her daughter out of school and hire a private tutor when a man tried to take a photograph of her near campus, she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/20/4F787F0B00000578-0-image-a-18_1535484112290.jpg","title":"Inside Harrys Eton bedroom England flag Lynx photos women portrait mother","story":"    Harry posing at his desk: two bikini-clad women are seen on his wall, as well as a framed black and white portrait of his late mother Princess Diana (far left).

According to The Balance, Diana’s estate consisted of stocks in addition to her £17 million orce settlement.It also included jewellery, dresses and other personal belongings that were valued at approximately £21 million on the day that she died and netted her heirs £13 million, after taxes. But who did she leave her possessions to?She signed her last will and testament on June 1, 1993, but modified the will with a codicil on February 1, 1996. The will stated that her estate would be left in equal shares in trust to her sons until they became 25, with her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale, to act as co-executors and co-trustees.The codicil changed the trustees from her mother and her personal secretary, Commander Patrick Desmond Christian Jermy Jephson, to her mother and sister.However, it was reported that because her mother and sister did not like the provisions of the will, months after Diana’s death, they were able to distribute her estate differently after obtaining a secret variation order from the High Court of Justice.In addition to £50,000 that was left to her butler, Paul Burrell and ‘chattels’, or ‘personal effects’ which were left to her 17 godchildren, a Discretionary Fund was formed for Prince William, Prince Harry, their spouses, their descendants and charities, selected by the co-trustees.          Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer pose following the announcement of engagementThe Balance reported: ‘The Discretionary Fund received the following assets of the estate: intellectual property rights, all wearing apparel, £100,000, and accumulated income earned by the fund\u0027s assets.‘The Discretionary Fund is to be held for a Perpetuity Period which will last until 21 years after the death of the last surviving descendant of his late Majesty King George VI who was living on the date of Princess Diana\u0027s death.‘King George VI was the father of Queen Elizabeth II, grandfather of Prince Charles, great-grandfather of Prince William and Prince Harry, and the subject of the 2010 movie, The King\u0027s Speech.‘The income earned by the fund is to be distributed among the fund\u0027s beneficiaries during the Perpetuity Period as the trustees see fit. Anything left in the fund when it expires will go to the then living descendants of Prince William and Prince Harry.’What is referred to as the Residuary Estate was left in equal shares to William and Harry and the shares were held in trust until each Prince reached the age of 30. However, when they turned 25, they were given access to all the income and also, the power to change the final disposition of his trust if anything should remain at the time of his death.At the time of each Prince’s 30th birthday, their Residuary Estate shares were worth £10 million each.          Kate Middleton wears engagement ring of Diana, Princess of Wales, as she poses for the mediaWhat Kate Middleton inherited from Princess DianaAccording to The Telegraph, Diana’s Letter of Wishes stated: ‘But I would like you to allocate all my jewelry to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewelry to your discretion.’After Prince William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, she has been repeatedly compared to Princess Diana and has also been spotted wearing her late mother-in-law’s jewellery. As reported in Good Housekeeping, the first piece that was given to Kate was her engagement ring.While rumours emerged that Harry had picked out the ring originally, after seeing William’s love for Kate, he traded the sapphire gem for his mother’s Cartier watch. William carried the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and eventually proposed.When the engagement was announced, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well. It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement.’As mentioned above, Kate has also been seen wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara, which was made in 1914 with diamonds and pearls. It was given to Princess Diana by The Queen as a wedding present and once Kate married into the Royal Family, she inherited the piece.The Duchess of Cambridge also inherited a pair of sapphire earrings from Diana in 2010, but they have since been updated to a drop style. Alongside this, Kate was also seen wearing a pearl bracelet, by Nigel Milne in 1988. While it wasn’t as iconic as the other pieces, the Duchess chose to wear it at a reception in Berlin.          Meghan Markle is seen here wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring which belonged to DianaWhat will Kate inherit from Diana when the Queen dies?Kate Middleton could also reportedly inherit Princess Diana’s title of Princess of Wales when The Queen passes away and Prince Charles becomes King, according to Elle. Prince William will become William, Prince of Wales and Kate, the title of Princess of Wales.The People’s Princess was the last person to hold this title after Camilla, Charles’ second wife declined taking up the title out of respect for her husband’s first wife.National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, August 29Meek Mill and his Dream Chasers team to give 6,000 backpacks to Philadelphia school studentsWhen is the Bachelor in Paradise finale and who gets dumped?Who is Tobias Menzies?

Following attempts to negotiate with the man, a Taser was discharged and the man was detained under the Mental Health Act.\u0027No officers were injured.          Officers were called to the sports centre at 7.53am this morning, following reports of a man exposing himself\u0027The man did not suffer any injuries but he has been taken to hospital as a precaution.\u0027 The suspect is a 34-year old man who had reportedly jumped into the pool and threatened to harm officers and members of the public. All members of the public were evacuated from the pool and no one suffered any injuries.As the commotion continued, Danny John-Jules found himself inadvertently caught up in the situation, as the man locked himself in the centre.The Red Dwarf star was on his way to use the gym just before 11am this morning when he came across the situation, where at least ten police cars had surrounded the sports centre.He tweeted a video, showing the police presence outside the centre and said: \u0027So I just turned up to go to the gym and this is what I was greeted with..\u0027\u0027You know what I mean. What\u0027s going on? So apparently there\u0027s a geezer or someone hold up in the gym and there\u0027s a hostage negotiator being called for.  The Strictly star was caught up in the drama as he attended Willesden Sports Centre for a training session\u0027So welcome to north west London.\u0027The bemused actor went on: \u0027So my Strictly prep has been thwarted by a man who has stripped off in the swimming pool. That\u0027s right. One guy stripped off in the swimming pool... I thought I was at Notting Hill Carnival!\u0027However, he has now hit back at newspapers at the scene who he has slammed for \u0027never contacting me for a story about me\u0027.Speaking at the scene he said: \u0027All these newspapers have just used my video without my permission.          No officers were injured during the incident. Police cars took over the majority of the Willesden Sports Centre car park (pictured above)\u0027They\u0027ve never once contacted me for a story about me. But now when it suits them they all want to talk.\u0027The actor was apparently fuming that some papers had unearthed Twitter rants he had made about Strictly in the past.The 57-year-old said: \u0027They\u0027ve dug up things I said about Strictly on Twitter years ago, out of a dustbin, and put it on the front page.   Following the incident the suspect has been taken to hospital and has been detained under the Mental Health Act \u0027Now they\u0027re taking my video about this story about a madman in a swimming pool - don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a bit hypocritical?\u0027Brent Council have issued a statement on Twitter which states that the pool will now be closed for the rest of the day.‘Following an incident earlier today Willesden Sport Centre\u0027s pool remains closed. But the gym, sports hall \u0026amp sauna are now all open as normal. The pool is expected to be open tomorrow. Apologies to our users for today\u0027s earlier closure.’          The centre was closed earlier in the day due to the ongoing incident with the man who had locked himself in the swimming poolOther witnesses at the sports centre, which was evacuated this morning (Wed) said a big muscular man could be seen \u0027strolling around the pool naked\u0027.Onlookers said he could be heard \u0027thumping\u0027 on the inside of a police van as he was taken away this afternoon just after 2pm.The 42-year-old witness, who did not wish to be named, said: \u0027He was walking around the swimming pool.          Witnesses said the man could be heard banging on the police van when he was being taken away\u0027I didn\u0027t see him swimming just strolling around the pool naked. Very naked. He was a big guy - he looked quite muscular.\u0027There is a still huge police presence, dozens of officers, at least 10 police cars and a fire engine.

The eye of the storm was just 50 miles from their position meaning the duo faced giant waves, rain and thunderstorms and had to lock themselves in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours.In one terrifying incident Steve says he was also swept overboard, saved only by the fact he was tethered to the boat all the time.  Steve Sparkes, left, and Mick Dawson, right, initially expected to complete their trip in around 55 days, but weather delays meant the pair spent more than 80 days at sea          Following the storm, the pair were offered a tow for the remaining few miles into Hawaii, but decided it was important for them to complete their amazing journey greatestThe pair were offered a tow back to the finish line but turned down the offer, wanting to complete what they started under their own steam.Steve, of South Brent, Devon, said that despite all the challenges he was thrilled to be back on dry land and was met with a flask of tea after having no gas to make hot food or drinks for the last few days.          The pair of intrepid rowers celebrated upon their arrival on Hawaii after their 3,000-mile tripHe said: \u0027It feels amazing - I am buzzing right now.\u0027It is great to be back on dry land and I will have such good memories. To be greeted the way we were in Hawaii was just the icing on the cake. There were so many people there and the reaction we got was amazing.\u0027It is just a feeling of relief at having finally conquered the trip.The welcome was fantastic and all the pain just went out the door.\u0027Of course I am very proud to have done it and become the first visually impaired person to.\u0027Hopefully people with similar problems in life, both physical and mental, can look at it and maybe think \u0027I can give it a go.\u0027\u0027The rewards having achieved it far outweigh any downside and has made me feel exceptionally boosted. I am sure that feeling will last a long time.\u0027          Changing currents and adverse weather forced the pair to travel an extra 600 miles           The pair were just 120 miles from safety when they found their path was blocked by a hurricaneWhile the direct route is 2,400 miles, weather conditions and changing currents means Steve and Mick, 54, rowed closer to 3,000 miles.The row has been completely unaided and the pair carried their own food and supplies, as well as equipment for turning seawater into fresh drinking water.During the journey the pair suffered several other setbacks - including breaking two oars in rough conditions.Due to his lack of vision, Steve also slipped on the deck of the boat, nicknamed \u0027Bojangles\u0027, injuring his face and head, and he also suffered a knee injury which made the journey slower.He added: \u0027I make no bones out it - I found it incredibly gruelling from the word go. We didn\u0027t have the best of weather and from day one it was choppy and it just got worse.\u0027It did not go as predicted and we started by looking at 55 days but in the end it took us 82.\u0027There were very rough seas and one turned us over and I ended up in the sea. That was a shock to the system and a real eye opener at what the Pacific can throw at you.\u0027You just never knew what was around the corner. 120 miles out we were blocked by Hurricane Lane which was right on top of us.\u0027That was an horrendous experience.\u0027The whole trip was full of ups and downs but I am just thrilled that we cracked it. I still think \u0027crickey - how did we do it?\u0027Part of me wants to do it again so can enjoy the rowing a bit more in calmer conditions.\u0027The pair took it in turns rowing for two hours and spending two hours resting and coped through bouncing off each other.Steve added: \u0027There are always times when you doubt yourself but you just have to pick each other up. Mick is an accomplished ocean rower and kicked me when I needed to be kicked.\u0027We just bounced off each other to keep us motivated.\u0027Mick added: \u0027It is very easy to lose the will to live out there but there was nothing we could not make a joke about and that was how we coped.\u0027The hurricane was right on top of us. We had an idea where it was due to go and were able to stop early enough but we were still hit by formidable winds.\u0027The worst thing was we were crammed in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours while the storm past over us.\u0027Steve\u0027s blindness is due to a rare form of macular degeneration known as Stargardts. He has lost his sight completely apart from some peripheral vision of shapes and colours.He was medically discharged from the Royal Marines at a time when there was little in the way of support in place for injured veterans.Ten years after his discharge Blind Veterans UK, then known as St Dunstans, tracked down Steve who was by then living in Malta.They flew him back to the UK and provided the first training and support to help Steve deal with his condition. He has since worked consistently with and for Blind Veterans UK helping other veterans come to terms with their loss of sight.The pair are raising money for Blind Veterans UK, and also The Royal Marines Charity for their challenge and their total currently stands at £10,000.The pair are due to fly back to the UK on Saturday and are visiting Pearl Harbour with the US Marines tomorrow (Wednesday).Visit www.cockleshell-pacific.com to make a donation. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/12/4F7E86E800000578-0-image-m-13_1535542608395.jpg","title":"Return begpackers Western tourist begs money Thai people travel","story":"A Western tourist has sparked anger in Thailand after begging for money from locals working at a marketAccording to the website Coconuts, two unidentified men were sitting next to  signs written in Thai and English.However, it is not clear whether both were begging or one was simply a friend or someone who had just sat down to talk.British cave er\u0027s mother insists her son IS taking legal...Thai police say they will summons British teenager raped on...Share this articleOne sign said: \u0027My name is Alex.

Though they could if they wanted to.\u0027I\u0027d like them to get in touch with me and Alan, that would be a nice touch, to say thanks for trying to help us, sorry it didn\u0027t work out. It would be some recognition, wouldn\u0027t it, really?\u0027I was prepared to do a lot for them but didn\u0027t get the chance. I was hoping they\u0027d take up law or be a doctor or something like that.\u0027          Alan and Judith Kilshaw are pictured together with Judith\u0027s new husband Stephen Sillett shortly ahead of their marriage in 2009The first time she learned of the twins, Kiara and Keyara Wecker, going to university was when she read about it in the press, she said.\u0027I\u0027m pleased that the girls have gone to university,\u0027 she said. \u0027Obviously I would have preferred them to stay in Britain. At least they\u0027ve come out of it pretty unscathed and they\u0027re doing well.\u0027They\u0027re coping well and seem well-adjusted if they\u0027ve got that far in life. They\u0027d have gone to university if they stayed with us in Britain, that\u0027s for sure.\u0027Missouri-born twins Kiara and Keyara Wecker were just six months old in 2001, when the Kilshaws, of Buckley, North Wales, tried to buy them over the internet for £8,200.The deal was already completed and the twins taken back to Wales when the Kilshaws realized a California couple had already paid to take custody of the kids through an adoption agency  - all thanks to a scam perpetrated by their birth mother.The FBI got involved, sparking an international legal battle that finally ended with the children being raised by a third set of foster parents in Missouri.Now the sisters, who were brought up knowing about their extraordinary story, have turned 18 and are studying social sciences at a university not far from their home in another state after moving. Relief as mother, 41, who left police \u0027extremely concerned\u0027...Kentucky woman is found guilty of murdering her on-off...Share this articleJudith said that she and Alan still see the twins as part of their family, and still believe that the adoption was wrongly overturned.\u0027Of course we still miss them,\u0027 she said. \u0027As far as I\u0027m concerned, they are still part of this family as the adoption was turned over by dubious means.\u0027If someone takes your name, then the adoption is overturned and the twins are taken away from you by dubious methods, to me that adoption still stands legally.\u0027She added: \u0027The chance to speak to them will come in time.

The twins are mixed race.\u0027We\u0027d have been just as good parents as the new foster parents.\u0027          The Kilshaws, who maintained they were unaware that the twins had already been through two sets of parents, had been dealing with Internet adoption broker Tina JohnsonShe has struggled to move on with her life, she said. \u0027I haven\u0027t made a shrine to them or anything. I don\u0027t go in for that. I keep my thoughts in my head. But if I met them, I\u0027d say I\u0027m pleased they\u0027ve done well.\u0027I\u0027m pleased they\u0027ve gone to university. I hope they do well and study well.\u0027They\u0027re going to the same university, so they must be close. I\u0027m pleased with how their life has gone up to know.\u0027Asked whether she or Alan would pay for the twins to visit them in Britain, Judith said: \u0027I don\u0027t know how their finances are. I can\u0027t pay for them. I\u0027m struggling myself and Alan hasn\u0027t earned any money since he\u0027s been in hospital.\u0027 In 2009, Judith, then 55, left Alan and her two sons and married ‘toyboy lover’ Stephen Sillett, 42, who she met in a nightclub.At the wedding, Alan gave his ex-wife away to Stephen and wished them well.\u0027It\u0027s a bit unusual, but there are probably quite a lot of husbands who\u0027d like to give away their ex-wives, so perhaps I\u0027ll start a trend,\u0027 said Alan at the time.Judith and Stephen are still together.           Alan and Judith Kilshaw speak to reporters outside their farmhouse in Buckley, north Wales shortly after the twins were taken out of their custody"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/06/4F7BBF8000000578-6108937-image-a-1_1535521870415.jpg","title":"US Open officials express regret Alize Cornets code violation","story":"    Walkback: US Open released this statement Wednesday expressing regret over the matter of Alize Cornet\u0027s shirt change was handled the day before              US Open officials have come under fire for reprimanding a female tennis player for taking her shirt off on court Wednesday          French tennis player Alize Cornet (pictured) returned from a heat break when she realized her sports top was on backwards          Cornet exposed her black sports bra during the quick change, which lasted about 10 seconds          The Women\u0027s Tennis Association said the code violation handed to Cornet was unfair\u0027All players can change their shirts when sitting in the player chair.

But I’ve got to realize that they’re on their own path, whatever path they’re on, and I’m on mine.”The goal for Dugan and Fabbre is to shed light on an overlooked and underrepresented group of people. “People don’t usually see images of transgender people, or they don’t imagine what they look like later in life,” said Fabbre. “There are few gender representations of older people in the trans and gender nonconforming community, so that was one motivation we wanted to create that for younger trans people.”The duo went off the beaten path, traveling from coast to coast, from Boston to Birmingham, Los Angeles to Arkansas, documenting the lives of trans people living across America. It was partly to reveal how underrepresented this group really was.“We also wanted to record the history, many people we photographed and interviewed had done significant activism and has helped us for where we are today,” said Dugan. “Many of these people came out prior to the internet, but their stories have not been told.”The duo wanted to go beyond the more mainstream representations of trans, like Caitlin Jenner or the Emmy-winning show Transparent. “They have their benefits, but we wanted to focus on a trans experience outside of a celebrity culture or a Hollywood representation,” said Dugan. “We wanted to look at everyday people and how they’re living their lives.”The book features a compelling portrait of Justin Vivian Bond, an award-winning New York actor photographed at the age of 54, and Los Angeles-based personality Duchess Milan, photographed at 69, which Dugan defines as “self-possessed and strong”.Fabbre has done extensive research on the LGBT community and aging, and recognizes the current moment we’re in. “Right now, we’re in a ‘trans moment’, but people have been doing this for decades,” she said. “I wanted to break stereotypes of older people as being rigid or too binary, and it’s not only about iniduals, but the world we live in and how this world responds to gender, for better or for worse.”The book cover features a portrait of 70-year-old woman named Gloria wearing a fur coat in Chicago, a central figure to the LGBTQ community for running a Charm School.“Gloria has mentored and taught primarily trans women of color how to be a lady,” said Dugan. “She is much beloved by everyone there and is a legend, in some ways.”In another photo, Dugan recalls an “aha moment” while in rural Arkansas doing a shoot with a man named John, who received support from his family “as a small town person”, said Dugan. “It was such a profoundly moving story.”Some of the interviews tap into how complicated aging is with the health care system in America. “If you’re talking about health care for people as they age, you’re also talking about financial stability and employment, and discrimination, that’s still a struggle,” said Fabbre. “We’ve made some advances thanks to trans advocacy and some policies have changed.”The struggle continues, though, and the book’s title is a line from an Ani DiFranco song called Talk to Me Now from 1990. “A lot of trans communities are focusing on survival, trying to find housing and employment, it could be read in that way,” said Dugan. “But it’s also arriving at your authentic self after a journey.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a607784bb5a36add768147dafb31c7a7ad78f074/0_0_5082_3543/master/5082.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c601b522940194c4dcd8b97a9c0d4aea 1760w","title":"ban sale energy drinks to children uk government combat obesity","story":"Move follows health concerns about heavily caffeinated and sugared drinks Ministers will ban the sale of Red Bull, Monster Energy and other energy drinks to children in England amid growing concern about the impact that the high-caffeine, high-sugar drinks are having on young people’s health.A consultation on how to implement the proposed ban will be unveiled on Thursday, with Downing Street indicating that the principal question to be determined is whether the purchasing restrictions will apply at the age of 16 or 18.Theresa May said the consultation was linked to the government’s childhood obesity strategy and said it was necessary to examine the consumption of energy drinks “often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks”.If you’re a parent, what have been your concerns with your children and energy drinks?

We will consider some of your responses in our ongoing coverage. You can read terms of service\u0026nbsphere. The principal justification for the ban is the high level of caffeine in the energy drinks, which has been linked to a string of health problems for children, including head and stomach aches, as well as hyperactivity and sleep problems.A 250ml can of Red Bull contains about 80mg of caffeine, roughly the same as a similarly sized cup of coffee, but three times the level of Coca-Cola. Monster Energy, which is often sold in larger cans of 500ml, contains 160mg of caffeine.Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef and food health campaigner, said he welcomed the prospect of a ban on energy drink sales because “too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast” and “teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted because of these drinks, packed with stimulants”.Two-thirds of children aged 10 to 17 and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consume energy drinks, according to the government announcement.Steve Brine, the public health minister, complained that “in some outlets it is possible to buy four 250ml cans of energy drink for £1”. The 12-week consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks that contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre.A Downing Street source added that introducing a ban was all but certain, saying: “It’s a question not of whether we do it, but how.”The move is the latest step in an increasingly interventionist approach being pursued by the Conservatives in relation to childhood obesity and health. When he was the chancellor, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks.Drink brands such as Red Bull, Relentless, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become increasingly popular. Children and teenagers drink them more than adults, even though industry labelling guidelines state that any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about its content and state that it is not recommended for children.The compulsory health warnings read: “High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women or persons sensitive to caffeine.”Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people. That’s why we’re pleased to see the government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children’s health.”The proposed ban only applies to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can all follow suit if their administrations wish. In March, several major supermarket chains announced that they would ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16.The teachers’ union NASUWT called last year for the sale of the drinks to under-16s to be banned by all retailers. Its national official for education, Darren Northcott, described the beverages as “legal highs” that helped to fuel bad behaviour in schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5bf9684a1d51d33aba45eead3aba9a2b1a4f5b6b/0_111_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3687f95bc17998d069e622978fb66aad","title":"car manufacturing in britain fell by 11 in july reports smmt","story":"Trade body calls for ‘political and economic clarity’ after sharp reduction in UK demandDespite the reduction, the sector remains on track to meet 2018 expectations, said the SMMT.Model changes, operational adjustments and preparations for new emissions standards affected output last month, said the SMMT.

Negotiators for Canada and the US are locked in “intense” talks as they try to strike a new trade deal by the Friday deadline set by President Trump.Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said on Wednesday evening that talks were at “a very intense moment” but added there was “a lot of good will” between negotiators on both sides of the table.The pressure is on to modernise the 24-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement after the US and Mexico reached a bilateral deal on Monday.Trump set a Friday deadline for all three countries to reach a deal, but Canada said late on Wednesday that a number of tricky issues were yet to be resolved.Trump has warned he could try to go ahead with a deal with Mexico alone and impose tariffs on Canadian-made cars if Ottawa does not agree a deal, although US lawmakers have said that ratifying a bilateral deal would not be easy. The US President told reporters at the White House:They (Canada) want to be part of the deal, and we gave until Friday and I think we’re probably on track. We’ll see what happens, but in any event, things are working out very well.We recognise that there is a possibility of getting there by Friday, but it is only a possibility, because it will hinge on whether or not there is ultimately a good deal for Canada.No NAFTA deal is better than a bad NAFTA deal.”France’s President, Emmanuel Macron, is preparing to push other EU leaders to agree a Brexit deal with Britain, according to a report in the Times.Macron is hoping to persuade fellow leaders that a close relationship with Britain after Brexit will promote a united Europe.He will use a summit in Austria next month to outline a new structure for European alliances, the Time said, quoting unnamed diplomatic sources. The idea is based on “concentric circles” with the EU and the euro at the core and Britain in a second ring.If this is the case, it will be a major boost to Theresa May, who has been hoping to strengthen her hand in negotiations by persuading inidual leaders that a decent Brexit deal for Britain will be good for the EU.Will Barnier’s Brexit boost to the pound last?Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, says there will be more volatility in the weeks ahead:Many investors would be wondering whether Barnier’s statement could be a turning point for the pound. Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. If positive news flows continue when Brexit secretary Dominic Raab heads back to Brussels on Friday to resume talks, GBPUSD may quickly return to July highs that were above 1.33. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline.

This is something that most hadn’t thought was possible and may trigger a partial reassessment of no deal Brexit risks that lends support to a politically-infested pound.While we’re not jumping to any conclusions about the actual final Brexit deal (this remains highly complex), constructive comments by Barnier (and Brexit secretary Raab) suggesting that negotiations remain on track – and a deal can be achieved – may be enough to ruffle the feathers of speculative GBP markets that have latched onto a bearish no deal Brexit story."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b9afcfbd29b0e450c7bbefed3a5b9df59d11850/0_39_5296_3178/master/5296.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cfb727e4c83784b46f70e15feb67490","title":"where it was but not how it was how the sicilian earthquake divided a town salemi","story":"The 1968 disaster left at least 231 people dead and 100,000 homeless, but it was rebuilding Salemi that split the local communityOn a summer’s night in Salemi, an ancient hilltop town in eastern Sicily, a group of children are playing football across the floor of church, using each transept as a goal. Some older teenagers sit below the altar, laughing and gossiping loudly.A local bar owner, Fabrizio Internicola, looks on. Does it seem strange to him to see kids kicking a ball around inside a grand 17th-century church?“No,” says Internicola emphatically. “For those of us who live round here, it’s nice to see kids playing football, or people playing music there. It means the place is still alive.”The church, Chiesa Madre, was destroyed by a violent earthquake that ripped through Sicily 50 years ago this year, killing 231 people and leaving almost 100,000 homeless. The valley of Belice, where Salemi lies, suffered acutely some towns were rendered totally uninhabitable.In Salemi, the majority of the population moved to the new lower part of town and continued their lives, leaving the beautiful old town – which includes a Norman fort, a winding Arab-style street structure and numerous grand 17th-century buildings – largely in ruins. And so it stayed until 1984, when the then mayor, Giuseppe Cascio, hatched what would prove to be a controversial plan to revive it.He enlisted the help of the Sicilian architect Roberto Collovà, and a now-legendary Portuguese architect, Álvaro Siza. Siza had made a name for himself in the 1960s for working with local contexts: his public swimming pools, for example, were set within rocks on the shoreline, following their contours. His understated projects stood in contrast to the monolithic modernism of the mid-20th century: vast Le Corbusier-inspired developments that followed a similar script whether they were in Marseille or Mexico City. For Siza, architecture was not about these “privileged forms and materials” but “the problems of the people and their environment”.With Salemi, Siza had a whole town on which to test his context-specific approach – a difficult task in an architecturally proud country where the phrase dov’era e com’era (where it was and how it was) has come to express the desire of many Italians to rebuild damaged buildings exactly as they were.In Salemi, by contrast, Siza chose “where it was, but not how it was”, says Professor Maurizio Oddo, an academic at the Kore University of Enna. “In terms of design methodology, it was totally innovative. The mentality of the project was to adapt to the reality of the problems created by the earthquake.”Many parts of the old town, including ancient paths and steps, lay in ruins. Siza and Collovà envisioned a plan to bring the old town back to life using understated interventions in public spaces. They rebuilt steps outside houses, created new covered paths between different districts of the town that had previously been unconnected, and created an entirely new piazza within the ruins of the old Chiesa Madre. The work used a muted, straight-edged style, made of local white stone. It was subtly different from older buildings in the town so that the traumatic damage of the earthquake could be quietly expressed in the new architecture. “A multitude of small details disappear into the design as a whole,” wrote the influential architecture critic François Burkhardt in praise of the project. For him, the architects had captured “the spirit of the ancient place”, without losing the “courage to express it anew”.The most striking element is the new central piazza of Salemi, on the ruins of the old church. The two architects deemed this a work of “subtraction” rather than construction: they cleared rubble, removed unstable parts of the old church and stabilised what remained, leaving pillars from the old building standing in the square to show what had previously been there. “At the time, this was revolutionary,” says Oddo. “As a building, as a piazza, it functions in a totally different way in respect to the original.” Rather than building a replica of the original church, they created an entirely new space that serves as a vivid memorial of the old – but where children can play, and concerts and events are frequently held.The approach proved controversial, particularly among some of the older inhabitants of Salemi, who remain nostalgic for the original grandeur of the Chiesa Madre. But their ire is largely directed at the authorities who allowed the damaged church to fall to ruins in the 15 years following the earthquake, rather than Siza and Collovà, who based their project on extensive local consultation. Collovà lived only an hour and a half’s drive away, and was a frequent visitor over the decade that the works took place: an important factor in preventing the renovation works from being seen as a foreign imposition. Walking around Salemi, the scope of the project becomes clear. While some parts of the old town still remain in ruins and cordoned off – one ripped-open house reveals bathroom tiles and an electrical plug frozen in time since 1968 – those recuperated by Siza and Collovà are filled with children laughing and playing, while locals sip drinks in the piazza at nightfall.The old town, however, remains underpopulated compared with the bustling new town on the hill below. The current mayor, Domenico Venuti, is attempting to attract a younger and more erse population to its winding streets. Yet for all its success, Siza and Collovà’s project remains unfinished. Siza has blamed this on the competing visions of successive town mayors: Cascio lost his job as mayor soon after commissioning the project, and his successors either couldn’t or wouldn’t find the money to finish it. Many of their interventions have also been altered: handrails added to staircases, or drainage channels funnelled in a different direction using crude plaster. “You see those stairs,” says local architect and politician Vito Scalisi, pointing out Siza’s work. “Beautiful. But quite difficult to climb.”Internicola, the bar owner, has nothing but praise for the restorations. “If you speak to people who are 70 or 80, they say that they made a mistake, they should have rebuilt the church in 1968,” he says. “But younger people like me, who grew up in the square, think it’s beautiful. It means the earthquake is part of our history.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4c1139d630a7c0666877be76f16d1e9","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

The government should interveneWelcome to the most unregulated labour market in Britain. Since 2008, au pairs have been specifically excluded from the legal definition of “worker” or “employee”: they have no right to the national minimum wage, they are not covered by health and safety regulations, there are no limits on their working hours and they have no legal right to holidays or any time off.In theory an au pair is a young person, normally from another EU country, who will do 25 to 30 hours of childcare and housework in exchange for room, board and “pocket money” and is treated as a member of the family. In practice, the working and living conditions of au pairs often fall far outside these expectations. Rather than being young women on a fun gap year aboard, too often au pairs are a hidden, exploited group of low-paid migrant workers. When you add to this the dominance of unregulated online agencies and high rates of youth unemployment in many EU countries that au pairs come from, it’s easy to see how problems might arise.It was common for ads to set out duties that went beyond “help” with childcare and housework, including shopping, cleaning windows, caring for relatives’ children, waitressing or cooking for dinner parties, gardening, teaching a child a language, and more. One ad stated that the family wanted an au pair to help with their business as well as “helping to run the home”. Another offered “use of horse and kayak” as part of the remuneration package. Worryingly, we found that many au pairs are expected to do work that in the past would have been done by a qualified nanny, including providing sole care for babies and infants.Interviews with au pairs reinforced this picture of “au pair” being a catch-all term for low-paid domestic work. They told us about long hours of housework, overwhelming childcare duties, and a general expectation that they could sort out all the stresses and strains of modern life for their host families.While Uber drivers and Deliveroo couriers are left without rights because they are deemed to be self-employed, au pairs’ work is quite simply defined as not being work. Instead they are considered to be “helping” their host families and involved in cultural exchange rather than labour, no matter how many hours of work they do or how arduous that work is. When you live with your employers, negotiating better conditions – or even just better juice – is not easy.While the prospect of the stream of au pairs drying up post-Brexit has created some recognition of how important they are, we should also pause to consider why so many families are reliant on an unregulated, insecure and often exploited group of workers. The British Au Pairs Agencies Association has released new guidelines on what an au pair should be. At the very least, the government needs to adopt these and enforce them. But a bigger step would be to recognise childcare and housework as real work.• Rosie Cox is a professor of geography at Birbeck, University of London, and co-author of As An Equal?

But radical movements should look to their own failingsAlex Salmond and Jeremy Corbyn may seem strange political bedfellows. But the movements with which each is associated have something in common. Each is sustained in part by powerful myths, turbo-charged by social media, of betrayal and conspiracy. If things go right for their movements, they say the people have spoken. But if things go wrong, their supporters’ first response is too often to cry foul.It is clear that the allegations of sexual impropriety against Scotland’s former first minister, and Salmond’s decision to quit the Scottish National party on Wednesday night to clear his name, will have political consequences. Whatever the truth of the allegations, and whatever the outcome of the investigation by Police Scotland, there will be a significant public impact. The future of the SNP, which has dominated Scottish politics for more than a decade, may even rest on the outcome of Salmond’s potentially career-defining argument with Nicola Sturgeon’s government.The reaction of many Scottish nationalists, especially on social media, has been all too predictable. Faced with an uncomfortable event, several cyber-nats have claimed that the allegations, and the way they became public, were all a unionist plot orchestrated by MI5 to destabilise the nationalist cause, in the interests of the UK state. For some, the clincher was that Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s senior civil servant in charge of the preliminary investigation into the allegations, is married to a former head of MI5, Jonathan Evans.Except that she isn’t. The target of so much current nationalist ire is in fact married to Derek McVay, once of the Edinburgh punk band the Visitors, who runs a music business called Del Boy International. What is more, McVay is now an active and prominent member of the SNP’s own Edinburgh Central branch. So it’s just possible that in her handling of the allegations Evans was simply doing her job, and the deep state, if it exists, has nothing to do with it.Now consider Corbyn’s Labour party. As part of The World Transformed, the Momentum-led event that runs parallel to the Labour conference in Liverpool next month, there will be an event titled A Very British Coup: Wargaming a Radical Government. As the title implies, this is a game based on Chris Mullin’s clever 1982 novel of the same name, in which a leftwing Labour leader becomes prime minister and is brought down by a combination of media barons and Labour rightwingers, in cahoots with MI5 and the CIA.The promotional material for the Liverpool wargame is certainly enticing – at least for anyone masochistic enough to be steeped in Labour politics of the Tony Benn era, as Corbyn himself is. Fifty players will take on the roles of “the different factions of the 1980s Labour party”. They “must compete and collaborate” to ensure their policies are prioritised by the new Labour government. Meanwhile, other participants are playing “the malign forces of the deep state whose task is to frustrate and sabotage the realisation of Labour’s socialist programme”. Writing in the New Statesman, the columnist Paul Mason admitted that the Liverpool wargame might be fun, while dismissing it otherwise as pointless. Mason believes that 30 years of free-market economics have led to the strengthening of the rule of law and a state that “operates consciously within legal checks and balances”. To compare the behaviour of the state in the Mullin era with the behaviour of the state today is simply “the stuff of fantasy”.But it’s a fantasy that simply does not go away. One of the reasons is Labour’s history, which is studded with periods and events in which the security services and the political parts of the police force either played, or were alleged to have played, a decisively anti-Labour role.No event in that saga has more staying power in the Labour mind than the Zinoviev letter of 1924. This forged letter, purporting to come from the head of the Communist International in Moscow, urged British communists to give militant support to the plan of the first Labour government to recognise the Soviet Union, and to set up cells in Britain’s armed forces. Probably fed by MI6 officers to the Daily Mail, the letter was published at the start of a general election campaign in which Ramsay MacDonald’s Labour was trounced by the Conservatives.Ever since, the Zinoviev letter has been, as the title of a new book by the former Foreign Office historian Gill Bennett has it, “the conspiracy that never dies”. There were attempts to get to the bottom of the affair in the 1960s, which may have contributed to the growing suspicions of the Labour leader, Harold Wilson, about MI6’s attitude to him and his government. As recently as 1998, the then Labour foreign secretary, Robin Cook – who had been a prominent critic of the police special branch when he was a backbencher in the 1970s – set up a review of the case .Bennett wrote that review. Like most historians, she argues that the Zinoviev letter did not cost Labour the 1924 election. But the Labour fear that it did lives on nevertheless. This enduring belief – to which the conspiracy theories that are so rife in social media have given fresh energy – is one of the things that gives permission to radical movements to imagine that they are faced with a ruthless and obdurate deep-state enemy that is dedicated to frustrating their policies.It would be naive to dismiss this fear entirely. But Mason is right that the much-mythologised deep state now operates in a more constrained manner than it did in the 1980s and certainly the 1920s. Radical movements love to think that the only reason their inherently virtuous projects can fail is because conspiracies, faintheartedness or betrayals have brought them down. The reality is that they have made mistakes, or their projects are not so virtuous after all.Blaming it for your cause’s defeats – especially when the blame starts before even getting into power – is a sign of your cause’s failings, not the wickedness of the deep state. Parties must own their failures as well as their successes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dbdbd3b9769291269888934a64ab5b1e15a35fd8/0_0_650_395/master/650.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceea427b48a38cf0138633084f972a5a 685w","title":"john ruskin artists victorian social critic","story":"He believed life should be beautiful, inequality was an outrage and that capitalism lead to aesthetic degradation. No wonder the quintessential Victorian speaks so powerfully to our timesIt is a familiar tableau of urban Britain. Labourers dig a tunnel, a porter delivers goods, a man swigs beer, there are young children and dogs, police and aristocrats look on there is dirt and beauty and life all thrown together. Ford Madox Brown’s pre-Raphaelite painting Work (c 1852-63) has been reworked many times. In the latest effort, the comic artist Hunt Emerson gives it a knockabout cartoon feel, but with a distinctly current edge: the cast is multicultural, the tools more hi-tech and there are allusions to social dysfunction, the gig economy and the housing crisis.Emerson’s update also alludes to the social critiques of Brown’s contemporary and friend, John Ruskin: a writer, artist, social critic, polymath and aesthete. Emerson’s illustration is the central image of A World of ... Work, an exhibition at Brantwood, Ruskin’s former home in Cumbria. It also figures in How to Work, a comic made in collaboration with writer Kevin Jackson, and one of three in their recent collection , Bloke’s Progress, a playful re-examining of Ruskin’s ideas through the eyes of a modern everyman, Darren Bloke.Ruskin was born in London in 1819 to a wealthy Scottish wine-merchant father and a strict Evangelical mother. Having graduated from Oxford University in 1842, he came to public prominence with his defence of JMW Turner, published in the first volume of his acclaimed treatise on art, Modern Painters. He gained fame as a public intellectual – writing, teaching and delivering lectures on art, architecture and other subjects, all in his eccentric style. Ruskin’s art criticism and advocacy was a particular inspiration to the pre-Raphaelites.In the 1860s, he turned his attention to politics and society against the backdrop of the inequality and rampant poverty many suffered in the industrial capitalist age. He railed against the exploitation of the poor and the self-interest of the wealthy. Ruskin proposed reform, and carried out practical projects – such as getting his students to work on widening roads in Oxford – which provided a hands-on social parable for his beliefs. While much of his thinking was considered radical, and could be considered a precursor to socialism, he adhered to an older conservative tradition that believed in hierarchy and the established authority it also suggested that those who naturally held power had a duty to serve and protect the poor. By the mid-20th century, some of his ideas had filtered into the perceived wisdom of the British welfare state.“In some ways, Ruskin seems like the most Victorian of the Victorians, so not applicable to our lives now,” says David Russell, associate professor of English at Corpus Christi College Oxford. “People get hung up on how eccentric some of his ideas were, but the core of his claims remains relevant and important. That is to say: our aesthetic experience, our experience of beauty in ordinary life, must be central to thinking about any good life and society. It’s not just decoration or luxury for the few. If you are taught how to see the world properly through an understanding of aesthetics, then you’ll see society properly.”Ruskin, who died in Brantwood in 1900, has been cited as an influence on William Morris and Gandhi, the arts and craft movement, ecological thinking and the foundations of the welfare state. His most searing social critique is contained in his 1860-62 essays, Unto This Last, in which he takes a scythe to Victorian capitalist values: “the art of establishing maximum inequality in our own favour … the rash and absurd assumption that such inequalities are necessarily advantageous, lies at the root of most of the popular fallacies on the subject of political economy”.In his conclusion, Ruskin states baldly: “Luxury is indeed possible in the future – innocent and exquisite luxury for all, and by the help of all but luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant the cruellest man living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfolded.”A central line of thinking for Ruskin, cutting across his art criticism and political writing, is that a society founded on structures that are embroiled in heartlessness – in brutal treatment of people and the environment around them – is indifferent to beauty. As we see the growth of vast inequalities today, such billionaire tech firms employing precarious workers with diminished rights and pervasive environmental ruin, it is not hard to see parallels in our current moment.This year, David Zwirner Books published the long out-of-print Giotto and His Works in Padua, Ruskin’s consideration of the Italian painter’s 12th-century fresco cycle at the Arena Chapel in northern Italy. Even here, when contemplating the beauty of early Renaissance art, Ruskin writes: “As long as it can bear to see misery and squalor in its streets, it can neither invent nor accept human beauty in its pictures.” As Robert Hewison adds in an introduction to the new edition: “Is this 1860, or 2018?”Whether Ruskin remains an influence on the left, however, is another matter. “There is an important echo in contemporary radicalism,” says Jeremy Gilbert, a member of the founding national committee of Momentum and a professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London. “Ruskin is not really much of a presence in contemporary left culture, but there are definitely resonances, especially in the popularisation of post-work politics.”Ruskin’s criticism of the alienating nature of work and the aesthetic impoverishment of industrial capitalism chimes with current arguments about inequality and the despoiling of the environment. But, for Gilbert, “it’s never clear with Ruskin what the strategy was meant to be politically to resolve the problem.”Where Ruskin’s continuing political influence is concerned, Gilbert says he remains central to an ethical-socialist radical tradition, a belief-system embraced Tony Benn and even Jeremy Corbyn, whose “own vision of the world is a moral one: it’s not really about class struggles, so much as it is about wanting a moral and ethical society”. While Ruskin is not widely cited by the left today, this concept is something he espoused. Gilbert suggests that the strongest link between Ruskin and contemporary discourse lies in the possibility that automation might be a liberation – allowing people to lead more creative and and aesthetically fulfilled lives because they don’t have to do boring work anymore. In Unto This Last, Ruskin offers, in his elaborate style, exhortations: “The equality of wages, then, being the first object towards which we have to discover the directest available road, the second is … that of maintaining constant numbers of workmen in employment.”There are also provocations: “Whereas it has long been known and declared that the poor have no right to the property of the rich, I wish it also to be known and declared that the rich have no right to property of the poor.”And there are dramatic paeans to what might be possible. “There is no wealth but life. Life including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration,” he writes. “That country is richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings.”When Ruskin did publish his social criticism, there was a backlash from his audience: the wealthy, educated elite. The essays that became Unto This Last were originally published in Cornhill magazine but he had to end the series because his editor, William Thackeray, along with much of the readership, were horrified, Russell explains. The economic establishment were contemptuous and said he had no practical business insight to draw on. The World of Work exhibition in Brantwood, which runs until this weekend, considers how artists have responded to human labour, and is underpinned by Ruskin’s writing on the laissez-faire capitalism of the Victorian industrial age. Alongside Emerson’s update of Work, there is a very broad interpretation: George Mason’s rural idyll The Harvest Moon, John Cassidy’s sculpture The Ship Canal Digger and AS Finlayson’s paintings of an aero-engine production line offer optimistic and noble visions of work. Set against these are stark visions in paintings like Peasant Woman with a Pitchfork by James Pelham and Graham Sutherland’s Press for Making Shells. The exhibition runs into the present day, with images including Jonathan Ive’s design for the iPhone.The David Zwirner Books edition of Ruskin’s writing about Giotto is part of the gallery and publisher’s Ekphrasis series – reissuing largely out-of-print writing on visual arts by the likes of Vernon Lee, Marcel Proust, Alice Michel and Paul Gauguin. “When I was in university, I don’t think I was ever taught Ruskin,” says Lucas Zwirner, the managing editor of the imprint. “In his lifetime he was a celebrity. And then he was totally out of fashion. There’s such richness there that I think there are cycles of engagement – maybe we’re entering a place where people want a different kind of writing about visual art.”Zwirner says he was introduced to the Victorian due to his somewhat unlikely influence on the punk and counter-culture infused drawings of Raymond Pettibon – former Tate director Nicholas Serota also encouraged him to publish the Ruskin work. Ruskin is referenced directly in the title of The Ethics of Dust, a series by the artist, architect and preservationist Jorge Otero-Pailos. Here installations are created out of minute dirt, dust and matter that has accumulated over years at old buildings, including Westminster and Doge’s Palace in Venice. “It’s a really important part of the radical tradition to be able to say that one of the things wrong with capitalism in general is that it produces a certain kind of aesthetic degradation,” says Gilbert. “And that does speak to something that really intuitively, people recognise – not just aesthetes, not just intellectuals. Most people have a sense of the way in which corporate culture cannot produce beauty. It can appropriate it and sell access to it, but it can’t produce it.”There is a banner in the Brantwood exhibition that simply reads: “To Do Good Work”. It is by the Sheffield-based art partnership Poly-Technic, which uses words as polemic in its art, riffing on trade union banners and other types of sloganeering, as well as creating collective community projects that take messages out in public. “That was something Ruskin was doing,” says Howard Hull, the director of the Ruskin Foundation and Brantwood Trust. “He was making actions and finding words or concepts which could be taken out and used.“Famously, the first bit of writing that Ruskin ever did was three lines long: a little sermon that his mother got him to preach in the home on a Sunday, in which he stood up and proclaimed: ‘People be good’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6fa94a4e72a1b91d10b21cf02c45fb958945eb/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c9ed13e044375852cbbb2cba8a6f3e","title":"clashes expected over japans bid to resume commercial whaling","story":"Japanese government expected to propose reforms to the International Whaling Commission allowing them to circumvent the current banAttempts by Japan to resume commercial whaling are likely to raise controversy at the International Whaling Commission meeting, as opponents decry the country’s suggested reforms as a covert way to revive the banned practice.The Japanese government is tabling proposals that would allow members of the IWC to circumvent some of its key decisions, such as ending the killing of whales for consumption of their meat.Japan, which holds the chairmanship of this year’s IWC meeting in Brazil which starts on Tuesday, has continued to kill some whales at sea for many years, but has been able to do so to a limited extent under the IWC provisions for scientific research, which many experts regard as a pretext.Japanese officials have said reform of the international body, set up in 1946 as the dangers to whale stocks became clear, is necessary because of its slow decision-making processes, the result of frequent disagreements between pro and anti whaling states.The global consensus on conserving whale stocks has come under attack from Japan before. The moratorium on whaling, signed in 1982 and confirmed four years later after intense pressure from conservationists, still stands, but loopholes allow meat from whales killed for scientific purposes to be sold on the open market.Norway and Iceland continue to support small minke whaling fleets, despite the moratorium, as they have registered objections or reservations. Russia has also registered an objection to the moratorium, but does not exercise it. Japan takes minke whales under the scientific research provision, but the meat has only a small market.A few indigenous populations, such as Inuit people, who traditionally eat whale meat, are permitted a small amount of subsistence whale-hunting under the ban.Japan is likely to face stiff opposition from countries such as Australia and New Zealand at the two-week meeting in Brazil that starts next week.Earlier this year, the Icelandic company Hvalur announced it would resume hunting fin whales, which are classed as endangered. The last time fin whaling took place in Iceland was 2015, when 155 were hunted, mostly for the Japanese market. Minke whales are also hunted in Iceland, though usually far fewer than the government-allocated quota.Patrick Ramage, marine conservation programme director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said whaling was “outdated and uneconomic”. He advocated “responsible whale watching, rather than whale killing” and said the global movement for whale conservation had far more support than whaling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bc2659c4e65878b47b9902829851df0eaaaf93/173_162_1325_795/master/1325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eadd87342176e7c6706a736e6bf3f8c8","title":"where the animals go wildlife tracking secrets revealed","story":"Award-winning geographer Dr James Cheshire and designer Oliver Uberti take us to the forefront of the animal tracking revolution, mapping the movements of animals on land, sky and sea – from Peru’s elusive jaguars to ant activity in a colonyThe elephants who crossed the railroadIn March 2016, Save the Elephants and the Kenya Wildlife Service collared 10 elephants to assess how the animals were adapting to a new railway bisecting Tsavo national park. They wanted to see if the elephants would use a series of underpasses that the construction company had been persuaded to include. Within 30 days, half of them had. Highly adaptable iniduals have even been recorded passing through drainage culverts as small as three metres wide.Source: Save the ElephantsBetween breeding seasons, grey-headed albatrosses take sabbaticals. Tracking data from light loggers has revealed three distinct behaviours: “residents” stay near their breeding area in the southwest Atlantic “shorter-distance migrants” fly to the Indian Ocean and back and “circumpolar migrants” round the entire Southern Ocean, sometimes twice. By the time a migrant reaches the Kerguelen Islands, strong tailwinds make it easier to continue circling Antarctica than to turn back and fly into the wind.About 20 years ago, scientists began using motion-activated camera traps to spot the elusive cats in study areas the size of Manhattan. From these sightings, they derived population estimates. Then in 2011, a GPS-collared jaguar in Peru showed that jaguars can have ranges 10 times the size of Manhattan. That meant prior camera-trap studies likely overestimated jaguar densities because their coverage areas were too small. In 2014, researchers installed 89 cameras across 650 square kilometres of Peruvian Amazon to get the full picture.The seals who map the Southern Ocean  Remote sensing tells us not only where animals go, it can also tell us about the environment an animal is moving through. To date, GPS-tagged elephant seals – with foraging es as deep as 1,500m – have collected more than 500,000 measurements of sea temperature and ocean salinity around Antarctica and under ice shelves. Their continual data streams keep oceanographers up-to-date on the changing climate, while educating us about their daily lives.Sources: Mike Fedak and Clint Blight, University Of St AndrewsBecause large birds are less able to sustain flapping flight, vultures must find sources of warm, rising air to make their extended daily searches for food. Wearing devices known as “daily diaries” that record location, air pressure, humidity, temperature, light level, speed, acceleration, and bearing, griffon vultures are teaching us how they stay aloft. Here we show just 3.5 minutes of flight above a village in southern France.Sources: Emily Shepard, Swansea University  Olivier Duriez, University of Montpellier Le Rocher Des Aigles Falconry CentreHow baboons move as oneWhen baboons disagree on where to forage, they don’t split up with leopards around, it is safer to stick together. So how does a troop settle a dispute? To find out, researchers in Kenya fitted 25 olive baboons with GPS collars set to record one position every second for four weeks. From more than 20m data points, they found a pattern. When the angle of disagreement between paths is small, the troop compromises and follows a middle path. If the angle is large, majority rules.

With CNN’s Anthony Bourdain documentary not out for at least another year, and the next episode of the Great British Bake Off almost a whole week away, here’s a list of all the food shows you should be watching instead.Somebody Feed Phil Netflix Everybody Loves Raymond creator Phil Rosenthal isn’t a travel expert or a food expert. However, he has a food-based travelogue on Netflix, which is probably down to his general enthusiam for both. Over the course of 10 episodes, he travels the world, from Copenhagen to Ho Chi Minh City, sampling the food and saying “Wow” a lot. This is as undemanding as food shows get, and that is saying something.Ugly Delicious NetflixDavid Chang has inserted himself as Netflix’s official food ambassador and Ugly Delicious is the centrepiece of his empire. Every episode, Chang and his friends go deep on a different type of junk food, exploring issues such as the links between fried chicken and racism or the US’s bastardisation of fried rice. Ugly Delicious can get a little up itself at times, but the pizza episode – where Chang nearly gets into a fistfight with an artisanal chef for declaring his love for Domino’s – makes great TV.Zumbo’s Just Desserts NetflixA sort of Australian Bake Off, Zumbo’s Just Desserts tasks contestants with making a new sweet treat per episode – a foot-high pudding, a gravity-defying dessert, something called a Franken-dessert – and it is just as fluffy and fun as you would expect. Plus, Rachel Khoo is in it – so that’s what she has been up to lately.Chef’s Table NetflixNetflix food shows are easy to spot, because they are the ones that treat food with a hysterical awestruck reverence that borders on religious. Chef’s Table is the epicentre of this approach. Each episode meets a new chef from around the world and basically lies prostrate before them while classical music plays in the background. Some of the episodes are great – Christina Tosi’s is a standout – but any more than three in a row and you will want to gorge on a Big Mac out of spite.The Mind of a Chef NetflixPBS’s The Mind of a Chef is slightly more playful than Chef’s Table – the chefs tend to get an entire series to themselves, so they are free to wander off down knotty little cul-de-sacs – but it is still relatively polite. April Bloomfield, the star of series two, is an absolute delight. In a world of celebrity chefs, her palpable awkwardness in front of camera is refreshing.Cooked NetflixEpisodes are titled Fire, Water, Air and Earth, which might suggest that Cooked is unbearably pretentious. And, to be fair, it is. It is food writer Michael Pollan exploring the evolution of our relationship with food in all manner of hifalutin’ ways. However, it is also an absolute work of art to look at. The Air episode, all about bread, is like visual ASMR.Last Call Food Brawl NetflixDespite its culinary loftiness, Netflix isn’t above indulging in the sort of dirty gluttony that made Man v Food such a success. Last Call Food Brawl has a loud host, aggressive music and tons of hipsters shouting at pork. This is either your sort of show or it isn’t.Fuck, That’s Delicious Now TVOne of my favourites. The host, Action Bronson, used to be a chef, and he now travels a lot for his day job as a rapper, so this show instantly feels more authentic than Somebody Feed Phil, and less stuffy than Chef’s Table. It is part cookery, part documentary and part weird state-of-the-world poetry. If anyone in the world will replace Anthony Bourdain, it will be Bronson.Rick Stein’s Seafood Odyssey iPlayerShows don’t tend to stick around on iPlayer for more than a month. However, some of its classic food shows are now permanent fixtures. This 1999 series, where Rick Stein developed his skill for going to new countries and complaining that Britain isn’t more like them, is one of them. It is probably Stein’s best.Floyd on France (iPlayer)Over the years, Keith Floyd developed a reputation for being drunk and uncooperative. But in this 1987 series, he’s on fine form curious and observant, regaling viewers with all manner of charmingly rambling anecdotes. Food is almost an afterthought, which is possibly for the best, since a lot of it looks grey and boiled. The series, however, is tremendous.Fanny Cradock Cooks For Christmas iPlayerA 1975 series that feels as if it has been beamed in from a different universe. Cradock is in her prime, covered in massive brooches and with eyebrows painted halfway up her forehead. She shouts at her audience as if she can barely stand to be in the same room. Nothing looks appetising and it is all very stressful. We have come so far since Cradock’s day, but have lost so much.Nailed It! NetflixNailed It! doesn’t bill itself as the anti-Bake Off, but that is what it is. Contestants try to replicate cake recipes they have found on the internet and almost always bodge them beyond all recognition. It is a brilliant premise, let down only by airless, edited-to-death American presentation.Kantaro the Sweet-Toothed Salaryman NetflixThis takes some explaining. Kantaro is a Japanese drama about a man with a near-sexual fetish for puddings. Every day, he sneaks out from work, samples a new Japanese dessert, explains what makes it unique, eats it and has what appears to be an orgasm that brings about hallucinations. It is brilliant and stupid in equal measure, although the episode about Kantaro’s mum probably crosses the line of decency.

Although his appetite to represent his country remains fierce, he understands the manager’s reasoning as England explore their options.Young’s club-mate Shaw is under consideration to step up as a replacement for the Nations League match against Spain at Wembley a week on Saturday and the friendly with Switzerland at Leicester three days later. The 23-year-old has played once under Southgate, gaining his seventh and most recent cap against Germany in March 2017, but has impressed this season despite Manchester United’s stuttering start.Southgate was in attendance at Old Trafford on Monday to witness Shaw’s performance against Tottenham, for whom Danny Rose played. Leicester’s Ben Chilwell and Ryan Bertrand of Southampton are alternative options at left wing-back.Joe Gomez, who missed the World Cup through injury, will return after an excellent start to the season at Liverpool. He will in effect replace the experienced Cahill, who announced this week he wished to take a “step back” from England commitments as he seeks to regain a place in Chelsea’s lineup.Southgate will retain faith with the majority of the squad who did so well in Russia but the United defender Phil Jones is expected to miss out through injury after limping away from Monday’s defeat by Spurs. Burnley’s James Tarkowski, on standby in the summer, is his expected replacement.Southampton’s Alex McCarthy could step in for Nick Pope, a long-term absentee after dislocating a shoulder in Burnley’s Europa League qualifier at Aberdeen. The manager and his assistant, Steve Holland, have watched McCarthy’s recent games against Everton and Leicester. The goalkeeper, uncapped but called up by Roy Hodgson in 2013 and Sam Allardyce in 2016, is likely to earn a recall ahead of Joe Hart, who is gaining regular playing time after moving to Burnley. Jack Butland is likely to be retained despite playing in the Championship with Stoke.Vardy’s retirement, revealed by the  on Tuesday, offers a forward a route into the squad. Southgate has been impressed by the uncapped Callum Wilson’s start to the campaign. The 26-year-old has sustained anterior cruciate ligament injuries in both knees since Bournemouth’s promotion to the Premier League, wrecking two of his top-flight campaigns, but has scored twice this season. Arsenal’s Danny Welbeck is likely to keep his place Daniel Sturridge, fit again after a promising pre-season for Liverpool, is a possible alternative and Jadon Sancho’s performances for Borussia Dortmund have been noted.Sancho could join Phil Foden and Ryan Sessegnon in the under-21s – they have European Championship qualifiers against the Netherlands and Latvia – and it remains to be seen whether Ruben Loftus-Cheek, limited to a solitary appearance as a substitute for Chelsea this season, retains his place in the senior squad.Ross Barkley has enjoyed more game time at Chelsea, while Southgate and his staff have also monitored Will Hughes’s progress at Watford. Adam Lallana is fit again having missed the World Cup after an injury-wrecked season for Liverpool."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56f28e92533f40a0755731fce5616f16215d060d/0_108_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae4e2c92ee7591f24e35eed0826073ad","title":"manchester united anthony martial contract","story":"• Board keen to hold on to previously disaffected player • Move is understood to have José Mourinho’s backingManchester United are in discussions with Anthony Martial about a new contract, in a move the board are confident has José Mourinho’s backing despite the manager previously being minded to allow him to depart.Martial has been disaffected under the manager, and considered ending his Old Trafford career. Mourinho also wanted the forward to leave, questioning his attitude and contribution to the team, and was content for him to be sold in the summer window.On the face of it, United’s bid to retain Martial could potentially put more strain on relations between manager and hierarchy after the club refused to grant Mourinho sufficient finances to buy a central defender of choice in the summer.Yet it is understood the board are confident of Mourinho’s support over Martial, and the move to prolong the player’s United career indicates their belief that the 22-year-old is yet to fulfil a potential that could make him one of the world’s elite players. The hope is that Martial will agree terms.Mourinho’s side have lost two of their opening three matches – at Brighton and on Monday night against Tottenham at Old Trafford. Following that defeat an angry Mourinho stormed out of the media conference demanding more “respect” from journalists. His next public briefing is on Friday when he is bound to be asked about Martial and the apparent reversal of his stance that the Frenchman can leave.Martial’s current terms end next year, though United have an option to extend to 2020. When signing in the summer of 2015 from Monaco under Louis van Gaal, Martial cost £36m, then a world record for a teenager, with the fee rising to £57m.In some quarters the board’s discussions with Martial might be interpreted as a further example of an erosion of Mourinho’s control over transfers, with United set to appoint a first director of football in the club’s 140-year history, as revealed in the\u0026nbspObserver."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/646a8357635baaaacd942df5418fd1bca824b806/499_354_2487_1493/master/2487.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=355f3482225762d0019b8db263f9743b","title":"nottingham forest newcastle united efl cup match report","story":"For two minutes Newcastle thought they had got away with it. They had trailed since the start to a header by their former striker Daryl Murphy but Salomón Rondón looked to have bailed them out with a stoppage-time equaliser. A penalty shootout loomed, or so it seemed.It turned out Rafael Benítez’s team were still ramshackle enough to concede two more goals, first to Matty Cash and then from an almost playful chip by Gil Dias. Forest made merry against a Newcastle team bordering on ridiculous.Aitor Karanka can take encouragement from Forest’s entertaining and effective display, which tournament organisers can cite as evidence that the Carabao Cup still has relevancy despite low attendances. The performance of Benítez’s side suggested another pertinent question: what is the point of Newcastle? Whether because of a lack of desire or a dearth of quality, this looked for a long time like an exercise in clock-punching by the bland men in black and white.Without a Premier League win and eliminated at the first hurdle from this tournament, Newcastle’s ambition remains a point of fierce contention between Benítez and Mike Ashley. The manager made seven changes to the lineup who tried to barricade themselves into their own box against Chelsea on Sunday but Benítez insisted “no one can say anything about that because the team was still capable of winning” against hosts who are 13th in the Championship.Forest made alterations, too. Karanka selected only six of the players who started their last Championship match but from the start Forest’s swift fluency contrasted starkly with Newcastle’s listlessness.Joe Lolley served notice inside the first minute, tearing through midfield before teeing up Dias for a shot from 20 yards that forced Karl Darlow into a ing save. Newcastle did not wake up and one minute later they were a goal down. Dias raced along the right wing before crossing for Murphy, who\u0026nbspheaded in at the near post.Forest continued to threaten, Lolley’s dribbling a particular delight. Newcastle struggled to cobble together moves and when they did so their workings were obvious. Forest were rarely stretched. Joselu nodded wide from close range from a corner in the 36th minute.Newcastle nearly conceded again within five minutes of the second half with Murphy foiled by a fine tackle by Federico Fernández after Darlow had spilled a shot by Dias. Michael Hefele gave Newcastle’s markers the slip from the corner but headed wide from close range.João Carvalho tried to deepen Newcastle’s woe just after the hour but his chip from a tight angle – more imaginative than anything produced by the Premier League team – bounced out off the crossbar.Rondón came to their rescue, the second-half substitute lashing in a low shot from 10 yards. Newcastle celebrated. Then they switched off.Darlow palmed a cross by Dias into the path of Cash, who drove into the net from 12 yards. Then, after Newcastle were denied a penalty for a foul on Ayoze Pérez by the Forest goalkeeper Luke Steele, Kenedy’s sloppy touch presented the ball to Dias, who looped it over Darlow from the edge of the box.It was no more than both teams deserved. Benítez disagreed. “The penalty was so obvious, we have the feeling we deserved more,” he said. “We did not manage the start well but then we had a lot of control. The positive thing is a lot of players did well in terms of effort. It was a question of managing better these final minutes.”Everton’s unbeaten start to the season continued with a 3-1 victory against Rotherham that puts them into the third round. After Gylfi Sigurdsson opened the scoring from close range, Dominic Calvert‑Lewin scored twice – either side of Will Vaulks’s late header for the visitors. The result gives Marco Silva his second win as Everton manager. Millwall fought back from 2-1 down to win 3-2, after initially going behind to Jamie Ness’s 41st-minute opener for Plymouth Argyle. After Shaun Williams equalised from the spot, Argyle once again took the lead through Freddie Ladapo before an 83rd-minute equaliser from Lee Gregory was followed by the 89th-minute winner from Aiden O’Brien. Watford ran out comfortable winners over Reading, with goals from Isaac Success and Domingos Quina sealing a 2-0 win.Benítez also claimed “the atmosphere is quite good” in the Newcastle camp despite reports of a training ground row between players last week. “You want players competing, players who care,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6805d7f5d95a2b76b18499837ba8505ec8239e3e/0_186_4327_2596/master/4327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=29e48c2fb4ca59d9c7ee5ef163f77965","title":"sam allardyce loses case against daily telegraph","story":"The former England manager Sam Allardyce has lost his complaint that the Daily  broke journalism’s rules by sending an undercover reporter to propose a business deal and discuss rules on the third-party ownership of footballers.Allardyce lost his job managing the national team in September 2016 as a result of the sting, in which one of the newspaper’s reporters posed as a representative of a fake sports management agency and secretly recorded their conversations. The press regulator Ipso concluded that the Daily ’s subterfuge was justified on the basis that it was a “productive and proportionate” way to investigate the types of commercial relationships Allardyce was willing to consider and the findings “could reasonably be considered to demonstrate sufficiently serious impropriety” to justify publication.The regulator concluded that while Allardyce, who was due to earn £3m a year as England manager, did not break Football Association rules he did “show a disregard for them” by discussing potential workarounds on rules regarding the third-party ownership of players– a practice banned in England and “widely regarded as ethically wrong” – and there was a clear public interest in reporting this.The England manager also entertained the idea of undertaking speaking engagements for the Daily ’s fake company for £400,000 a year, while making it clear that this would need the approval of his employers at the FA.“The newspaper had also gathered evidence that he was willing to negotiate speaker fees with a company that was explicitly interested in third-party ownership of players,” said the regulator. “During the second meeting, he had witnessed a conversation in which a football agent appeared to suggest that an unauthorised payment could be made to a player.”The 17,000-word ruling was delivered following an investigation into complaints by Allardyce, his agent Shane Moloney, and accountant Mark Curtis that they had been misrepresented and their quotes taken out of context.The manager has always insisted the sting was unfair because, as the regulator stressed, no rules were broken. He also complained that the coverage was unfair since it was linked to a wider investigation into “corruption”, suggesting serious wrongdoing.However, Ipso concluded that the matter was still in the public interest because of the high standards expected of such a prominent inidual and ruled it was fair comment for the  to say that Allardyce had “tried to make as much money as possible as England manager”.The regulator did rule that among the 15 articles published by the Daily  about Allardyce during September 2016 there were three significant inaccuracies that required correction.One related to a false suggestion the manager had implied third parties could benefit from transfer fees. The other two wrongly implied Allardyce had offered to brief the Daily ’s fake company on how to break ownership rules, rather than merely being willing to consider speaking at their events.The regulator’s verdict approving the subterfuge relied partly on the fact that the Daily  said it was acting on anonymous allegations against Allardyce dating back to early 2015 that he should be investigated, in addition to a tip-off from an anonymous “specific football agent”.The FA sacked Allardyce, who was last season also sacked as Everton manager, the day after the allegations were first published.In a statement issued last night Allardyce insisted that IPSO’s ruling was flawed, the  “had put words into my mouth” and called on the journalists involved to hand back awards they won for the coverage.He also criticised the leadership of the FA and how they handled their response to the story: “It was clear that those that I was dealing with were more concerned with their own image than getting to the truth of what had occurred.

Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.“We’re not cat haters,” John Collins, of the Omaui Landcare Trust told Newshub. “But we’d like to see responsible pet ownership and this really isn’t the place for cats.”Ali Meade, the council’s biosecurity operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the environment and bird life would be vast.Submissions on the pest management plan close at the end of October. However, not all members of the community are happy with the idea.Omaui resident Nico Jarvis told the Otago Daily Times that she was shocked and planned a petition against the plan. She said that her three cats were the only way to combat a massive rodent problem the area had. “If I cannot have a cat, it almost becomes unhealthy for me to live in my house,” she said.Jarvis likened the plan to living in a “police state … It’s not even regulating people’s ability to have a cat. It’s saying you can’t have a cat.”The move comes as New Zealand works on an ambitious goal to become predator-free by 2050. That plan is devoted to wiping out introduced species of rats, stoats and possums.The plan, announced in 2016, says that the government estimates the cost of introduced species to the New Zealand economy and primary sector to be NZ$3.3bn (£1.76bn) a year.Cats have also come under the spotlight for their tendency to target native birds.Kapiti Island’s Kotuku Parks subision has a no-cat rule and Auckland council is also looking at a plan to put down any cat caught in an “ecologically significant site” without a microchip.Economist turned parliamentary candidate Gareth Morgan has long proposed wiping out cats from the New Zealand as a way to protect native species from what he called “natural born killers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71e9960a3d377bae707d2e6360c49051016b2474/0_124_2924_1755/master/2924.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfabb202f8a6b8a8e73213f18f20e2f8","title":"how audiobooks turned me into a runner at 50","story":"Tired of having to interrupt your routine to change the song? You won’t have the same problem with an audiobook. You may even find yourself so enthralled that you run an extra mile without noticing Last year, when Peter Johnston turned 50, he had a life crisis. The Stockport native had a successful career as an IT consultant, a loving wife, two young daughters, and plenty of friends to go to the pub with most evenings. But on his 50th birthday, as he went into his bathroom to shave, he remembers not liking what he saw in the mirror.“I was evidently overweight, pale skin, bumps all over my face – you name it. I didn’t look good at all.” He admits that it’s probably a phase that most men his age tend to go through, a “realisation that you’re now definitely old, and that it’s going to be more difficult to keep up in the same way I used to be able to”. Which scared him, especially because he wanted to be healthy enough to play with his daughters and be a good dad for them as they grow up. He decided to take up jogging, with the aim of running his first half-marathon before his 51st birthday. He bought new running shoes and gym clothes, and his wife helped him set up a music playlist on his phone. He was all set to go, but he found his runs difficult.Not because he wasn’t able to endure them, but rather, that listening to music was not right for him. “After a while, I’d get bored – especially when you’re listening to the same tracks again. Don’t get me wrong, I love ACDC, but there are only so many times I can listen to Shoot to Thrill. Or, when you aren’t feeling a track but you can’t change it without interrupting your run,” he says. “Worse,” he adds, “when you’re in a busier area, like a high street, and you want to change the song, you have to keep jogging, while playing with your phone and making sure you don’t run into anyone. It’s a nightmare.” A work friend recommended that Johnston change his tune not to other forms of music, but, rather, to audiobooks – full-length books told through high-quality audio narrations, and presented in formats similar to podcasts. The medium has grown rapidly over the past five years, particularly on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones – and Audible now provides the world’s largest selection of audiobooks. According to the UK’s Publishers’ Association, around one in 10 Brits are now listening to audiobooks, while spending on the medium has more than doubled in the past five years to a total of £31m. Research commissioned by Audible from University College London earlier this year showed that audiobooks produced a stronger emotional and physiological response compared with visual storytelling mediums such as TV and video streaming, regardless of the genre of content being listened to. For Johnston, listening to audiobooks has multiple benefits. For starters, he says: “I’m actually reading a lot more.” He started off with Yuval Noah Hari’s Sapiens: A History of Humankind, which Johnston described as one of the “most thought provoking listens” of his life. “When you’re running, and listening to what’s basically the origin of human thought, why we do what we do, it’s pretty amazing,” he says. “I was listening to it while running through the countryside one weekend, and I was so engrossed in it, thinking about what was being said, and how that shaped the world around me I’d forgotten about my distance completely. I’d run a mile longer without even realising.” And it’s not just while running that he’s found audiobooks useful. Like millions around the world, he also listens to audiobooks when doing general day-to-day activities such as driving, doing household chores, and even when he’s relaxing in the bath. His favourites tend to be non-fiction titles, with one recently being Bill Bryson’s A Short History of Nearly Everything, which he stumbled on while browsing recommended titles on Audible. “It’s such a fascinating book,” says Johnston. “And it’s told in a really interesting and engaging way that’s humorous, but also really exciting. I wasn’t really that good at science in school, but I learned more about quantum physics from listening to that book while doing the laundry the other week than I did in four years of studying it at school.” Johnston will turn 51 in October. Since his birthday, he’s 12kg lighter, leaner, and says he feels “better than I’ve ever done in my life”. And that’s not just in his physical fitness, but, thanks to audiobooks, mentally too. “I’ve been able to discover all these things that I otherwise wouldn’t have the time to go out looking for,” he says. “I can browse through the library on my phone, or just type in a subject I find interesting one day and voila – I’ll find loads of books I can listen to at the tips of my fingers.”“Audiobooks aren’t just a way of keeping me entertained while I run miles,” says Johnston. “They’ve given me the opportunity to learn something new every day.”Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Virgin won’t let me do so unless I sign up to a new 12-month contract? That doesn’t seem right. Another reader tried to cancel her package after losing her favourite channels and was told that she couldn’t do so without incurring an early termination fee.The disappearance of UKTV was rooted in a row over money. It claimed Virgin had insisted on a multi-million pound cut in its fees Virgin argued that UKTV was restricting its customers access to its free-to-view channels.As a result, Virgin axed 10 channels, half available on free-to-view TV, in late July. It has since restored them after the companies resolved the impasse. The fact remains, though, that Virgin refused to release customers from their contracts despite the fact that they were no longer receiving the full service.Virgin has a history of such intransigence. It is being investigated by regulator Ofcom for levying hefty exit fees on broadband customers forced to cancel their contract after moving to an area not covered by its network (ie, half the country). Ofcom also says it “raised concerns” with Virgin over its refusal to waive early exit fees for those affected by the UKTV row. Virgin’s argument is that viewers are not paying specifically for UKTV, rather for a whole portfolio of services, including broadband, and that they can watch UKTV free on UKTVPlay.It claims to assess each request for early cancellation on a case-by-case basis.Ofcom’s rules state that contracts must be fair and that terms and conditions that allow a company to alter its services without allowing customers to cancel may well be deemed unfair.Customers who fail to resolve issues with a telecoms company can refer complaints to the regulator if a company fails to resolve them.Many subscribers of basic TV packages don’t realise that they could access many of the channels for free via Freeview, including UKTV, Plus 1 and music channels, and they can buy a box to pause and record shows.Disgruntled Virgin customers may therefore want to cost up the benefits of their service and seek cheaper options once their contracts have ended.If you need help email Anna Tims at your.problems@observer or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The couple reportedly wed on Saturday in Atascadero, after a ceremony on Young’s yacht near the San Juan islands.The guitarist Mark Miller appeared to confirm the news on Facebook when he congratulated the couple. He later clarified that he had not attended the ceremony. “I only knew about it because one of my friends attended the ceremony in Atascadero and announced it on his page,” Miller said.The administrator of Young’s blog also congratulated the pair, and referred to comments from attendees, who described the event as “a shindig”.Hannah posted a cryptic image to her Instagram account the following day. She captioned the picture of an owl: “Someone’s watching over us … love and only love.”Young and Hannah had reportedly been dating since 2014, when Young filed for orce from Pegi Young, his wife of 36 years. On the media scrutiny surrounding his relationship with Hannah, Young said: “We didn’t pay any attention to that. It doesn’t matter. We don’t give a shit. We don’t care, because they don’t know what they’re talking about. And if they do know what they’re talking about, we still don’t care, but we’re happy for them. It doesn’t matter. What matters is us, not the press.”This year, Young appeared in the Netflix film Paradox, a fantasy western musical directed by Hannah.At 72, it marks another chapter in Young’s life and work, as he continues to press on with new music. He has released six albums in the last four years, including two with a new backing band, Promise of the Real, who feature Willie Nelson’s son Lukas among their number. Long irritated by what he perceives as low quality digital music from Apple, Spotify and others, he has also recently created an ambitious online archive of his work in high-resolution audio. In December 2017, he sold off 418 lots of his possessions at auction, raising over $300,000 from his model train collection alone.Hannah continues to act – her most high profile recent role was Angelica Turing in the sci-fi Netflix series Sense8, a show whose cult popularity was so strong that fans successfully lobbied for a final “goodbye” episode after it was cancelled, which aired in June this year. But she is also a high-profile activist, having long campaigned against the Keystone oil pipeline system in Canada and the US. She has been arrested numerous times for her protests – including twice in front of the White House – and she and Young led a Washington-based march together in 2014."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a25441d9173f1b312aa729f595dd703b2042c3/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=31a3f54911f72e811995a08b4d7d3c6e","title":"how the us fracking boom almost fell apart","story":"The wild tale of America’s energy revolution, and the cowboy who made and lost billions on shale. By  Bethany McLeanThis remarkable transformation was brought about by American entrepreneurs who figured out how to literally force open rocks often more than a mile below the surface of the earth, to produce gas, and then oil. Those rocks – called shale, source rock or tight rock, and once thought to be impermeable – were opened by combining two technologies: horizontal drilling, in which the drill bit can travel more than two miles horizontally, and hydraulic fracturing, in which fluid is pumped into the earth at a high enough pressure to crack open hydrocarbon-bearing rocks, while a so-called proppant, usually sand, holds the rocks open a sliver of an inch so the hydrocarbons can flow. A fracking entrepreneur likens the process to creating hallways in an office building that has none – and then calling a fire drill.In November 2017, US production topped the 10m barrel-a-day record set in 1970, back in the last gasp of the legendary oil boom. This year, it is expected to reach almost 11m barrels a day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The Marcellus Shale, which stretches through northern Appalachia, could be the second-largest natural gas field in the world, according to geologists at Penn State. Shale gas now accounts for more than half of total US production, according to the EIA, up from almost nothing a decade ago.The apparent new era of American energy abundance has already had a profound impact around the world. Economies that were dependent on the high price of oil, from Russia to Saudi Arabia, have begun to struggle. The situation would have been unthinkable in the pre-2014 world of $100-a-barrel oil, and is playing out in strange and unpredictable ways.Since the 1970s, US presidents from Gerald Ford to both Bushes emphasised the importance of “energy independence”, although the country had in fact become more and more dependent, particularly on the Middle East. Under the Trump administration, the longstanding dream of America’s energy independence has taken a grander, more muscular turn. Secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke talks about opening more federal lands, including national parks, to drilling in order to ensure “energy dominance”.“We’ve got underneath us more oil than anybody, and nobody knew it until five years ago,” Trump told the press aboard Air Force One in the summer of 2017. “And I want to use it. And I don’t want that taken away by the Paris accord. I don’t want them to say all of that wealth that the United States has under its feet, but that China doesn’t have and that other countries don’t have, we can’t use.”But the shale success story nearly became a disaster. While to date, most of the complaints about fracking have focused on environmental concerns, there’s a bigger and far less well known reason to doubt the most breathless predictions about America’s future as an oil and gas giant. The fracking of oil, in particular, rests on a financial foundation that is far less secure than most people realise.Because so few fracking companies actually make money, the most vital ingredient in fracking isn’t chemicals, but capital, with companies relying on Wall Street’s willingness to fund them. If it weren’t for historically low interest rates, it’s not clear there would even have been a fracking boom at all.‘You can make an argument that the Federal Reserve is entirely responsible for the fracking boom,” one private-equity titan told me. That view is echoed by Amir Azar, a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The real catalyst of the shale revolution was the 2008 financial crisis and the era of unprecedentedly low interest rates it ushered in,” he wrote in a recent report. Another investor put it this way: “If companies were forced to live within the cash flow they produce, US oil would not be a factor in the rest of the world, and would have grown at a quarter to half the rate that it has.”Worries about the financial fragility of the fracking revolution have simmered for some time. John Hempton, who runs the Australia-based hedge fund Bronte Capital, recalls having debates with his partner as the boom was just getting going. “The oil and gas are real,” his partner would say. “Yes,” Hempton would respond, “but the economics don’t work.”Thus far, the fracking industry has been more resilient than anyone would have dreamed. But questions about the sustainability of the boom are no longer limited to a small set of skeptics. Those doubts now extend to the boardrooms of some big investors, as well as to the executive suites of at least a few of the fracking companies themselves. The fracking boom has been fuelled mostly by overheated investment capital, not by cash flow.If the story of the fracking boom has a central character, it’s Aubrey McClendon, the founder of Chesapeake Energy, a startup that grew into a colossus. For a brief moment in history, he most represented US fracking to the world. No one was more right and more wrong, no one bolder in his predictions or more spectacular in his failures, no one more willing to risk other people’s money and his own, than McClendon or, as one banker who knew McClendon well put it: “The world moves when people who like risk take action.”“He was the good face of the industry – the passion, the creativity, the daring,” another former investment banker told me. “But he was also the bad face.” And that duality makes him a perfect personification of the US fracking revolution.In the fall of 2008, Forbes had ranked McClendon No 134 on its list of the 400 richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of more than $3bn. But because he borrowed so much money and secured business loans with personal guarantees, lawyers were still wrangling over the remains of his estate two years after his death, trying to figure out which debts would be paid – from the $500,000 he owed the Boy Scouts of America to the $465m he owed a group of Wall Street creditors, including Goldman Sachs. Wall Street’s vultures – the hedge funds that invest in distressed debt – had descended, buying the debt for less than 50 cents on the dollar, essentially rendering a judgment that the claims wouldn’t be paid in full. If McClendon did die broke, it wouldn’t have been out of character. During his years as an oil and gas tycoon, he fed on risk, and was as fearless as he was reckless. He built an empire that at one point produced more gas than any American company except ExxonMobil. Once, when an investor asked on a conference call, “When is enough?”, McClendon answered bluntly: “I can’t get enough.”Many think that without McClendon’s salesmanship and his astonishing ability to woo investors, the world would be a far different place today. Stories abound about how, at industry conferences, executives from oil majors like Exxon would find themselves speaking to mostly empty seats, while people literally fought for space in the room where McClendon was holding forth. “In retrospect, it was kind of like Camelot,” said Henry Hood, Chesapeake’s former general counsel, who worked at the company, initially as a consultant, from 1993 until the spring of 2013. “There was a period of time that will never be duplicated, with a company that will never be duplicated.”“America’s Most Reckless Billionaire,” Forbes once called McClendon, and for many in the industry, that headline defined the man. But if it was a con, he was conning himself, too. Because he believed. He was, in many ways, the embodiment of a transformation that has changed the face of not just the oil and gas industries, but of geopolitics as well.In the darkest days of the collapse of oil prices in the mid-1980s, McClendon, as ever undeterred, saw an opportunity in assembling packages of drilling rights – for gas, not oil – either to be sold to bigger companies or to be drilled. In the mere existence of that opportunity, America is almost unique, because it is one of the few countries where private citizens, rather than governments, own the mineral rights under their properties. In order to drill, you just have to persuade someone to give you a lease. McClendon became what’s known in the oil and gas business as a “land man” – the person who negotiates the leases that allow for drilling. That, it turned out, would make him the perfect person for the new world of fracking, which is not so much about finding the single gusher as it is about assembling the rights to drill multiple wells. “Landmen were always the stepchild of the industry,” he later told Rolling Stone. “Geologists and engineers were the important guys – but it dawned on me pretty early that all their fancy ideas aren’t worth very much if we don’t have a lease. If you’ve got the lease and I don’t, you win.”In 1983, when McClendon was just 24 years old, he went into partnership with another Oklahoman named Tom Ward, “doing deals for scraps of land in Oklahoma, faxing each other in the middle of the night,” Ward said to Rolling Stone. Six years later, the two formed Chesapeake Energy, which was named after the beloved bay where McClendon’s family vacationed. They seeded it with a $50,000 investment.Neither Ward nor McClendon were technological pioneers. That distinction, most people agree, goes to a man named George Mitchell, who drew on research done by the government to experiment on the Barnett Shale, an area of tight rock in the Fort Worth basin of North Texas. Using a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, Mitchell’s team cracked the code for getting gas out of rock that was thought to be impermeable.“As oxygen is to life, capital is to the oil and gas business,” said Andrew Wilmot, a Dallas-based mergers and acquisitions adviser to the oil and gas industry at Purposed Ventures. “This industry needs capital to fire on all cylinders, and the founder and father of raising capital for shale in the US is Aubrey McClendon.”“To be able to borrow money for 10 years and ride out boom-and-bust cycles was almost as important an insight as horizontal drilling,” McClendon, with typical immodesty, said to Rolling Stone.On 12 February 1993 – a day McClendon would later describe as the best of his career – he and Ward took Chesapeake public. They did so despite the fact that their accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, had issued a “going concern” warning, meaning its bean-counters worried that Chesapeake might go out of business. So McClendon and Ward simply switched accounting firms. “Tom and I were 33-year-old landmen at the time, and most people didn’t think we had a clue what we were doing, and probably in hindsight they were at least partially right,” McClendon told an interviewer in 2006.In the decade before 2004, Chesapeake spent around $6bn acquiring properties, companies and leases. McClendon, who would later call these years the “the great North American land grab”, developed a reputation among his peers for overpaying. His aggressiveness didn’t endear him to the old-time oil men. “Everyone in Midland hated Chesapeake,” one said. “They came out here when land was leasing for $200-$300 an acre. All of a sudden, Chesapeake was paying $2,000-$3,000. They got in some good places because they shut everyone else out. Their attitude was: ‘We are Chesapeake, get out of our way.’”McClendon went on a corporate spending spree that would have put today’s Silicon Valley chieftains to shame. “Asking me what to do with extra cash is like asking a fraternity boy what to do with the beer,” McClendon told Natural Gas Intelligence in 2005. Nor was he frugal when it came to his personal life. He acquired multimillion-dollar mansions and resorts in Oklahoma, Bermuda, Maui, Vail, on Lake Michigan, and even in Minnesota. He had one of the best wine collections in the world.To Wall Street investors, McClendon was delivering on what they wanted most: consistency and growth. His pitch was that fracking had transformed the production of gas from a hit-or-miss proposition to one that operated with an on and off switch. It was manufacturing, not wildcatting. He became a flag-waver for natural gas – “Mr Gas”, as Fortune magazine once called him.“Aubrey was the first one to say, ‘Let’s create demand,’” Chesapeake’s Henry Hood said.Back in 2003, when McClendon was just getting started, the consensus view had been that the US was running out of natural gas. It became a fixation for Alan Green, the once-revered chair of the Federal Reserve, who warned Congress during a rare appearance that the shortage and rising cost of gas could hurt the American economy. Green recommended that the US build terminals to accept deliveries of liquefied natural gas from other countries. “We see a storm brewing on the horizon,” said Billy Tauzin, a Republican representative from Louisiana and the then-chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Such fears eventually helped push through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempted natural gas drillers from having to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, thus averting costly regulatory oversight.McClendon’s bullish view on prices became the conventional wisdom in energy markets. In 2007, the supposedly smartest investors in the world – among them Goldman Sachs and the takeover titan KKR – structured their massive $45bn buyout of a utility called TXU in a way that was essentially a bet that natural gas prices, then around $7, were set to rise significantly.At the same time, Vladimir Putin was making similar bets. In an attempt to set up a cartel for gas, the Russian premier hosted a group of gas-producing countries, including Algeria, Iran, and Venezuela, in Moscow. The US was not among them. “Costs of exploration, gas production and transportation are going up,” Putin said. “It means the industry’s development costs will skyrocket. The time of cheap energy resources, cheap gas, is surely coming to an end.”When the going got rough, McClendon had always survived by borrowing yet more money to acquire more properties. “Simply put, low prices cure low prices as consumers are motivated to consume more and producers are compelled to produce less,” he wrote in Chesapeake’s 1998 annual report. But he had forgotten the flipside of that industry truism. Time and again, in commodity markets, high prices encourage more producers to produce, creating a surplus, that then crushes prices – and producers. “He was right that shale changed the world,” said one longtime gas man. “He should have listened to himself.”The price of natural gas began to plunge in 2012, and in 2014, the price of oil followed suit. Falling prices quickly exposed the weak underbelly of US shale – its high costs and ravenous need for capital. Once-booming US production hit the skids. The so-called rig count – the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas at a given time – fell from 1,920 rigs in late 2014 to a low of 480 in early 2016. “We think it likely that to find a lower level of activity would require going back to the 1860s, the early part of the Pennsylvania oil boom,” Paul Hornsell, head of commodities research for Standard Chartered bank, wrote in a research note. By mid-2016, US oil production had declined by 1m barrels a day.One after another, debt-laden companies began to declare bankruptcy, with some 200 of them eventually going bust. In a report released in the fall of 2016, credit rating agency Moody’s called the corporate casualties “catastrophic”. “When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segment-wide bust of historic proportions,” said David Keisman, a Moody’s senior vice-president.Some of those who had bought assets from McClendon and others in the heyday also began to write down the value of what they had purchased. Statoil, the Norwegian energy giant, wrote down the value of its shale and Canadian oil sands assets by $4bn Royal Dutch Shell reported a write-down of more than $8bn. Most prominent was Australia’s BHP Billiton, which had spent $5bn investing with Chesapeake in the Fayetteville shale and ploughed another $15bn into the purchase of Houston-based Petrohawk. BHP put all the assets on the block in the fall of 2014, but found no buyers, and eventually wrote off more than $7bn – which begat the phrase “pulling a BHP”.As one investor put it: “All of the acquisitions of shale assets done by the majors and by international companies have been disasters. The wildcatters made a lot of money, but the companies haven’t.”The shale boom towns suddenly resembled their California counterparts after the gold rush. In the Cline shale east of Midland in Texas, Devon Energy decreased its rig activity and let its leases expire, citing “a lot of variability” in the formation. In the town of Sweetwater, “ambitions are fading fast as the plummeting price of oil causes investors to pull back, cutting off the projects that were supposed to pay for a bright new future,” wrote the Associated Press in early 2015. “Now the town of 11,000 awaits layoffs and budget cuts and defers its dreams.”Surveying the carnage in the spring of 2016, then ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told a gathering of analysts that due to the huge amount of debt most companies in the industry had accumulated, he couldn’t even find anything worth buying.When Aubrey McClendon died in his car, colliding with a concrete wall supporting an overpass at 90mph, it was hard not to see his death as the punctuation marking the end of an era. As the Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton asked: “Is Chesapeake the model for this business? It changes the world, but it ends in tears?”  This is an edited extract from Saudi America by Bethany McLean, which will be published by Columbia Global Reports on 12 September.

Of course I want people to join the Conservative party, but I want them to join because they support a broad swath of values.”Meanwhile, chairs of local Conservative associations are being reminded to check new members regularly and weed out those “whose declared opinions or conduct shall, in their judgement, be inconsistent with the objects or financial well-being of the association, or likely to bring the party into disrepute”.In a letter obtained by the Guido Fawkes website, the party’s head of membership, Natalie Crosby-Jones, reminds constituency chairs that they have an obligation to scrutinise members before confirming their membership on the party’s internal system. “Please check these iniduals carefully before you click ‘Approve’,” she wrote.With Theresa May facing an intensely challenging six months, and a growing number of her own MPs restless about the Chequers deal, the prospect of a leadership contest looks increasingly likely. Grassroots members would then have the final say, after MPs whittled the candidates down to two.When asked en route to South Africa earlier this week about whether she would step aside if she faced a vote of no confidence, May insisted she was “in it for the long term” but few in Westminster expect her to stay on much beyond March next year, when Britain is due to leave the EU.Campaign groups on both sides of the Brexit ide are readying themselves for the battle ahead, as negotiations in Brussels reach their final months.Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage emailed supporters of Leave Means Leave, the hardline Brexit group he recently joined, summoning them to a rally in Bolton in September.“We need to mobilise and do whatever it takes to get the Brexit we voted for. We need to pressure the government into chucking Chequers and supporting a world trade deal,” he said.“I want to see a bigger crowd than the remainers can produce. We’ve got to show them we mean business,” he said. Tickets to the rally are £5."},{"url":null,"title":"alize cornet penalty shirt removal us open tennis heat","story":"Like many people getting ready for work in a hurry, the French -tennis player Alizé Cornet mistakenly put her top on back-to-front.The 28-year-old quickly realised her error after returning from a 10-minute heat break during a match at the US Open in New York, where players have been -sizzling in temperatures of up to 35 degrees.What she didn’t expect was that by walking to the back of the court and swiftly switching the pink-striped top the right way round, briefly flashing a black and red sports bra, tennis would be plunged into a new sexism row.According to an interpretation of the rules, female players are not allowed to remove their shirts on court, despite the fact their male counterparts do so freely. The chair umpire presiding over the match wasted no time issuing the world No 31 with a code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct. Cornet’s facial expression suggested she was confused and angered by Christian Rask’s decision but he was unmoved.The whole episode lasted less than 10 seconds but is another heavy blow to the image of a sport that seems to tie itself in knots when it comes to the treatment of women players.The timing of the row is uncomfortable for the tennis authorities. It is not even the first time this week that the attire of women players has been in the spotlight. The French Open has just announced new “wardrobe rules” with an effective ban on the “black panther” catsuit Serena -Williams wore at this year’s tournament.The 36-year-old, who was making a comeback at Roland Garros after her daughter’s birth, wore a tutu on court in New York yesterday in an apparent comment on the French decision.Cornet went on to lose the first-round match against Johanna -Larsson of Sweden 6-4, 3-6, 2-6 but the debate around double standards it has prompted is likely to linger far longer in the collective memory of sport fans.The Women’s Tennis Association, which runs women’s tennis, eventually ruled the code violation was given in error while the US Tennis Association, in charge of the US Open, expressed “regret” at the decision.Prominent figures in tennis rushed to highlight an apparent gender ide in how the rules are applied.Rafael Nadal, the men’s world No 1, has a habit of removing his shirt at the end of every match because he sweated so much and felt that taking it off would prevent him from developing a cold. Novak Djokovic and other male players took their shirts off between games on Tuesday in New York to cool themselves with ice and towels in the sweltering conditions.The “heat rule” was in effect during Cornet’s match meaning players were allowed to take a break to cool off and rehydrate after the second set, while men could take a break after the third set. It was at this point that she put her shirt back on the wrong way round.Judy Murray, an outspoken advocate of women in tennis and a former captain of Great Britain’s female Fed Cup team, criticised the decision on Twitter. The US player Bethanie Mattek-Sands called the decision “weak”, while Australia’s Casey Dellacqua said it was “ridiculous”.The former British player Annabel Croft, covering the tournament for Amazon Prime, said she would have done exactly the same thing as Cornet.The USTA issued a statement saying it “regrets” that a code violation was given and Cornet would face no further punishment.Cornet welcomed the US Open’s apology last night – then criticised the president of the French Tennis Federation for banning Williams’ catsuit.She said she was shocked by how much attention the incident had received and accepted it as simply a mistake by the umpire.She said: “I was surprised when I just changed T-shirt really quick and he gave me the code violation, I didn’t expect it, and I told him it was pretty weird. I think it’s very fair from them to apologise to me. I really appreciate it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef7bccdf8f88d095828a62eee174d855b0e0bb2b/0_737_3648_2189/master/3648.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ffc8f6ea2ec9475559e687f2feaa6ebb","title":"andy murray us open defeat fernando verdasco","story":"Andy Murray went down in flames on the third and hottest day of the US\u0026nbspOpen, losing against Fernando Verdasco for only the second time in 15 matches. But he will leave New York encouraged to believe he may yet return to something like he was before injury threatened to end his career just over a year ago. If he does, it will be his greatest achievement.The Spanish left-hander served Murray off the court at times, and hit 52 clean winners to win 7-5, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 as the former world No\u0026nbsp1 struggled to compensate for 46 unforced errors. Verdasco said courtside: “With Andy it’s always tough. He’s an unbelievable fighter, even with the injury.”Midway through the third set of a match that was slipping from his weakening grasp, Murray heaved for breath on his chair and, bathed in ice from the towel wrapped around his reddening neck, looked more like a battered boxer on his stool between rounds than a father of two from Surrey earning his living at tennis.When asked to compare the physical demands of the sports two nights previously, he smiled quizzically and shook his head he was not smiling now.When they retreated to the cool of the locker room – in keeping with the 10-minute heat break that was introduced at Flushing Meadows on Tuesday, and four years after Murray called for it during an even more brutal New York heatwave – Verdasco had taken the set to lead 2-1. He had reason to believe he was one set away from a third-round match against the 2009 champion, Juan Martín del Potro, who\u0026nbspearlier saw off the American Denis\u0026nbspKudla in three sets.Murray had other ideas. He threw everything he had left at his adversary. Even when broken for 3-4, and limping, you could almost hear his heart beating through his sweat‑drenched shirt. That he fell short was no disgrace. That he finished full of fight in a lost cause was almost a victory.Hitting more with his arms now rather than through his hips and torso, he sprayed a worryingly high number of ground strokes, especially on the forehand. His serve did not click, either. In between, there was much magic and grit.Murray moved brightly in a confident start and a high point of the early exchanges was a 26-shot rally in the fourth game – the longest to date in the tournament – where his grinding instincts forced a long forehand out of an exasperated Verdasco, who had experienced many such moments in his 13 previous losses to the Scot. Murray broke for 4-2 and looked ready to rumble but, as has happened in the past, he handed it back straight away, passed at the net. It was not a day for wavering concentration.Verdasco, one of the most dangerous left-handed servers in the game, needed a line-painting ace on the edge of the deuce side to save set point. But Murray served a double fault to gift him another break, and he sealed the set with a crunching forehand into the ad corner after just over an hour.Disappointed with himself, Murray lifted his game noticeably to break for 3-1 in the second – and again he gave it back straight away. Verdasco caught the bug and a forehand wide cost him his own serve in the sixth game. He served a double fault for the sixth time to surrender the second set.There was a perceptible mood shift early in the third as Murray, tiring, was unable to fight his predilection to play long points, ending up in no-man’s land, tactically. Verdasco, serving out of his skin, broke twice in 20 minutes. From nowhere, Murray found inspiration to break and hold for 3-4, then 4-5, as his blows began to land more heavily. But he dipped once more and Verdasco was off the court in a flash to make the most of the heat break – while Murray was still sitting on his chair. He was not happy.A toxic mix of match rust and drained stamina had turned Murray’s features a weird pink after two and a half hours of gut-busting effort but his blood was raised also by the fact Verdasco had consulted with his team during the break, contravening the protocols.Murray’s bigger challenge was to win two sets in a row with lactic acid threatening to drown the oxygen gurgling through his wearied limbs. He had not won a five-setter since beating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in a Davis Cup match at Wimbledon in 2016. Indeed, he had lost four in a row since, the last one the cruellest, on one leg against Sam Querrey at the same place nearly 14 months.Up 2-1 with serve in the fourth, he shouted to his team: “I need all your support.” Nobody has ever doubted Murray’s fighting spirit. From there to the end, he chased and scraped like a dog in a doomed argument with a 10-ton truck. Even as Verdasco served for the match, his racket trembling, Murray grabbed five break points and forced six deuces in a dozen minutes of drama, before the Spaniard converted his third match point.On Court No\u0026nbsp10, Britain’s charge was shredded to zero when the Serb Dusan Lajovic outlasted Cameron Norrie 6-2, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4. The British player lost his serve and the plot when he returned late from his third-set heat break."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6594fc0d0ae222b243aa5caaf775d7b9c2787344/0_360_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebdc9bd7d1cf9da99c993b1534649b2b","title":"wayne barnes rugby referee retiring tmo","story":"The English referee begins his last full Premiership season at Exeter this weekend, wishing there was more TMO assistanceThe start of a new rugby union season is not just about players and coaches. Rarely have top-level referees been under more scrutiny, increasingly caught between a congested ruck and a hard place. Decisions in the modern game grow more hairline, the demands on its leading officials more intense. Without a capable whistle-blower to make sense of it all, the road to hell can be rapid.How blessed the sport has been to attract iniduals of the calibre of Wayne Barnes and Nigel Owens, experienced officials who can not only recite the lawbook but possess the all-important empathy to match. The better players visibly appreciate it, even when decisions go against them. Following New Zealand’s big win over Australia at Eden Park last Saturday, the first person to congratulate Barnes and ask after his family was David Pocock, the beaten Wallaby openside.Barnes was also deservedly praised by several Kiwi sages, more than a little ironic given the virulent criticism he endured in the aftermath of the All Blacks’ 2007 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Cardiff. These days the Englishman cuts a far more assured figure, which makes it even more bittersweet that he is preparing to hand in his sheriff’s badge and walk away at the height of his whistling powers.Over a coffee in Twickenham this week, barely 24 hours after flying back from Auckland, the 39-year‑old Barnes reveals several factors have prompted his decision. Next year, selection permitting, will be his fourth Rugby World Cup he has a growing young family and his wife, Polly, has just had a work promotion. He also wants to give more time to his “other” job, as a barrister specialising in bribery and corruption at a London chambers, a far cry from his teenage holiday job crushing berries in a Ribena factory – “It was a plum job!” – in his native Forest of Dean. After 200 Premiership games and 81 Test matches, the temptation to bow out at the top is understandable.As it stands that means this Saturday’s game between Exeter and Leicester will in effect mark the start of his last full Premiership campaign, with RWC 2019 in Japan earmarked as his international swansong. Given Owens is still going strong at 47, it represents a regrettably early bath for an influential figure who has steadily earned a global respect afforded to few English officials. The great Ed Morrison presided over the 1995 World Cup final should England fail to reach Yokohama next November, there must be a fair chance of Barnes doing likewise.Before that, though, looms a hugely significant season for the English game. Barnes, who refereed his first Premiership game in 2005, has had a ringside season ticket as concussion fears, tackle height anxiety and breakdown collisions have all intensified. “I wouldn’t say I’m concerned but it’s something we all need to be aware of. It’s ferocious and extremely physical. I think players are aware they’ve got to take a bit more responsibility. If it goes wrong you’re going to hit someone in the head and probably face a red card and a ban.”In Barnes’s view it would also be helpful to have more, rather than less, input from the television match official up in the stand. “I would expand it so we can check whatever we want without necessarily stopping the game. If, in a crucial moment, I can ask: ‘Is that a forward pass?’ and someone can tell me the answer in three seconds we don’t need to stop the game for 30-40 seconds. It’s like a scrum-half constantly talking to his No 10.” If such support had been on tap in 2007, it would certainly have saved him a world of angst.The latest RFU crackdown on players appealing to officials and waving imaginary cards also has Barnes’s firm support, even though it feels half a lifetime since he sent off Dylan Hartley, now England’s captain, for swearing in the 2013 Premiership final. “It’s not a subject we discuss a lot. It wouldn’t be our general chit chat. I just don’t think it would happen again. Dylan’s a superb leader … I think it was just a moment of frustration.“It was a massive shame it became the talking point. Pocock shouted at me at the weekend about something I’d got wrong but I had to remind him there are better ways of doing that. He said: ‘Of course, sorry, that wasn’t the right way.’”Yet when he does “hand over my rusty whistle”, Barnes will depart with far more happy memories than regrets. Last season’s European Champions’ Cup final, a horribly tough game between Leinster and Racing 92, was an unenviable assignment and Barnes returned to the sanctuary of his dressing room not anticipating much post-match bonhomie. Within seconds Racing’s Irish lock Donnacha Ryan had stuck his head around the door and invited him to share a beer or two. Barely had they blown the froth off the first when there was another loud knock. Enter Leinster’s Tadhg Furlong, bearing a further stack of beers for the Englishman and his assistants.There was another revealing snapshot following Saracens’ win over Exeter at Twickenham last May when Barnes sent Schalk Brits to the sin-bin on his farewell club appearance. Afterwards the hooker was given his yellow card to keep, inscribed with the message: “Dear Schalk, Sorry, Wayne.” English rugby should celebrate the unassuming Mr Barnes – Sir to you – while it still can."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/039ecb1a2954117ad18e980e21e39f1c1cd62038/67_0_2450_1470/master/2450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3a929c941eb54d040ccde092dfad0d2","title":"england batsmen nail places sri lanka india fourth test","story":"One up with two to play makes you the favourite to win. Yet on the eve of the fourth Test in Southampton the India team, though 2-1 down in the series, seem the more settled. For the first time in Virat Kohli’s reign as\u0026nbspcaptain he has indicated he intends to play the same side in consecutive Tests. Meanwhile England, despite their lead, remain a team in a state of flux.This may not be desirable but it is not necessarily a bad thing. The blunt truth is no one can be sure whether they have the right personnel in the England team, how long they should persist with batsmen, young and old, who are not producing the goods and then there is still scope to debate what\u0026nbspconstitutes their best bowling attack. There is no disgrace in being a team in flux. The situation would be worse if the selectors rigidly stuck to the same names come what may, instead of searching and experimenting. But some solutions soon would be handy.The instability of the team is illustrated by the realisation that for the Test tour to Sri Lanka in October the selectors can surely ink in only one specialist batsman, Joe Root. Consider the others. Alastair Cook and Keaton Jennings need runs to justify being certainties for the trip. Cook has one half-century in his past 14 Test innings Jennings has one half-century in his past 15 and a Test average of 23 after 10 matches. James Vince and Ollie Pope, both of whom were omitted from the final XI for the fourth Test, are easy on the eye until we peruse their records, though one should immediately add the caveat that Pope has played only three Test innings. Jonny Bairstow? He is a certainty for Sri Lanka but while he is playing at the Ageas Bowl as a batsman only he cannot really be regarded as a specialist, such is his determination to keep keeping\u0026nbspwicket.So it is Root plus four AN Others as the selectors contemplate their specialist batsmen for the winter. At Southampton there is at least the chance for two of them, the openers, to nail down a spot, which adds a spicy subplot to a Test that already has obvious importance since it could decide the\u0026nbspseries.Even the bankers in the top half of the order have something to prove. Bairstow has explained in forthright terms his eagerness to remain the wicketkeeper and he is entitled to do that, just as he is obliged to play as a specialist batsman if that is what the captain and coach want. How will he feel if he excels in his new role in this match, thereby providing evidence he can function so well as a specialist\u0026nbspbatsman?Then there is Ben Stokes in the middle order. He seems to be a different player now he no longer swashbuckles. Since his return to the side after the Ashes, Stokes has made two half-centuries in 10 innings, 66 in Auckland in April, 62 at Trent Bridge last week. In those innings his strike rate has been 35 and 33 respectively. In part this is a sign of increased responsibility on Stokes’s part given that in both those matches England were on the rack after dire first-innings performances with the bat.It may be Stokes has merely been restrained by the frailties of the top order, which have forced him to dig in but 12 months ago the great asset of Stokes the batsman was not as a dogged occupier of the crease. It would be reassuring to see him dominate an attack again and it would be helpful if the top order gave him the freedom to play that way – if he can.As usual all the pre-series talk of rotation among the bowlers has evaporated. Stuff happens: Stokes goes to court Woakes goes in the thigh so the team adjust accordingly and the old lags must keep going – at least until the series is decided. For this Test, the idea of playing Moeen Ali is a good one simply because he has been in such good form. He is a streaky cricketer, a dangerous opponent at his best, and England are right to try to cash in appropriately, even though that means omitting Pope.Meanwhile the India camp seems remarkably tranquil. The tourists possess the prize batsman of the series in Kohli and England’s priority has to be to find a way to get him out cheaply. In a bowlers’ series he has 440 runs at an average of 73.33 the\u0026nbspnext highest runscorer is Bairstow with 206.No wonder Kohli is relaxed and we learn he has had time to give his views to Wisden Cricket Monthly on The Hundred competition, which is proposed for 2020, and they fit the normal pattern: all those employed or beholden to the England and Wales Cricket Board profess to support the idea. Everyone else is distinctly unimpressed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf34e0c2fb2cdf50691ad55bbfb61372177a58f/0_68_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0473ff103b20b5206fdb636d89f161a","title":"us open tennis heatwave new york","story":"As temperatures soar in New York, we take a look at how the players and fans deal with the hot conditions at the US Open, where it was described as “dangerous” as five men had to retire from their first-round matches on Tuesday alone "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5dca9cd5a4115a53e52f5276e350b751e089309d/195_0_4666_2800/master/4666.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac6aede0f9bea9e73f114e1faf67f05c","title":"google home max review google assistant smart speaker","story":"Big new Google Assistant smart speaker finally launches in the UK with best-in-class voice control aiming to be the life and soul of the partyGoogle’s big, premium Apple HomePod rival the Home Max is finally being released in the UK today, bringing Google Assistant to the high-end smart speaker market.Announced in October 2017 and on sale in the US since November, the Home Max joins Google’s smaller Home and smallest Home Mini smart speakers as the big one. Google Assistant sorts voice commands, controls and questions exactly the same as Google’s smaller smart speaker offerings, but the way it sounds couldn’t be more different.The Home Max is relatively large box speaker, by smart speaker standards, with a white or black smooth plastic body and grey or charcoal coloured fabric front. In white and grey it’s simple fabric front and rounded corners make the Home Max look a bit bland up next to a Sonos Play:5 or an Apple HomePod, but it might be easier to blend in with soft home furnishings. It is about the size of a large bookcase speaker, but weighs over 5kg.White dots in the centre of the fabric front show when the Home Max is actively listening to you, when it’s working on a query or speaking to you, or shows the volume level when you adjust it.It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally with a little rubber foot that attaches to the bottom magnetically. When horizontal the hidden touch strip on top acts as a pause-play button and a volume slider, both of which work well.A mute switch on the back allows you to turn off the microphones if you would like a little privacy from Google Assistant’s listening out for its wake words, which are either “Hey Google” or the older “Okay, Google”. When the mute switch is flicked the dots light up red until you turn the mics back on.An analogue 3.5mm line-in socket and USB-C port round out the back, alongside the figure-of-eight power cable. There’s also Bluetooth for streaming your music directly from a phone, tablet or computer if you need to.Setting up the Home Max is super easy, but requires an Android or iOS device. Just plug it in, open the Google Home app on your smartphone or tablet, tap the button to set up a new device and follow the instructions. It took about five minutes to get the speaker out of the box and playing music.Google Assistant is the same on the Home Max as it is on any other Google Home smart speaker. Since the original Home launched in May 2017, Assistant has become smarter answering more and more questions, and is impressively able to not only recognise the words you’re saying but also what you’re trying to say – when you butcher a question, Assistant will still be able to work out what you want, more often than not.Assistant also has the ability to recognise inidual voices using Google’s Voice Match – a feature still not available for Amazon’s Alexa in the UK – so when you ask for an update on your calendar or music from your library you get your stuff, rather than stuff belonging to someone else who lives in your house.Google has also continually added to Assistants smart home device control, which now rivals Amazon’s Alexa in most categories.But it is Assistant’s ability to control a wider range of music services, including Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Deezer – combined with the best voice recognition – which has made it the one to beat.The Home Max certainly produces a big, aggressive sound and is loud enough as a single unit to fill even large rooms. It’s front-facing two 4.5in woofers and two tweeters produce fairly direct sound, making the Home Max a speaker to put at the end of a room rather than in the middle of it like Apple’s HomePod or the cheaper Amazon Echo. It doesn’t really have a sweet spot, however, sounding pretty uniform no matter where you sit in front of it.It has an intelligent audio tweaking system called Smart Sound, which uses the mics and AI to adjust the music as you play to a account for location, noise sources, track and even the time of day. Apple’s HomePod has a similar system built in, but Sonos’s Play:5 and others require an iPhone or iPad to tune the speakers each time you move them.The Home Max sounds punchy, producing music with lots of attack in the mids and deep bass. If you like big booming bass, you will love the Home Max, but I found the bass a bit loose in some tracks, missing some subtlety – turning the bass down in the equaliser helped a little.Rap tracks such as Dr Dre’s Still DRE, Forgot About Dre or The Next Episode sounded really aggressive and great. Jazz tracks such as Moanin’ by Art Blakey sounded warm and punchy, and it even did a fairly good job with Holst’s Jupiter performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.It seemed most at home with pop tracks such as In My Feelings by Drake or Anywhere by Rita Ora. But playing tracks such as Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys, where the intro drum beats lost a bit of their alternating rhythm, or a live version of Hotel California by the Eagles, which lost clarity and separation between inidual notes and vocals, showed the Home Max’s weakness.It has a big, powerful sound, but it lacks the sparkle and subtlety something like the Sonos Play:5 or Apple’s HomePod brings, which allows you to discover new parts of your favourite tracks you might not have been able to hear before.The Smart Sound tuning improves over time, and I found that the sound was a little more room dependent than others, sounding better in the longer, more open kitchen than the living room.Volume consistency between tracks on Spotify was also weak, with some tracks drastically louder than the previous. Dynamic range is great, but feeling like you have to jockey the volume between tracks isn’t. I also found thedirect, aggressive nature of the sound a little wearing over extended listening sessions compared to some more immersive rivals.The Home Max can also play in multi-room audio groups with other Google Home or Chromecast devices, which makes filling your whole house with the same music easy. Stereo pairing is also available, but I did not have two to test.The Google Home Max costs £399 and comes in two colours: chalk or charcoal.For comparison, the Google Home costs £99, the Home Mini costs £39. Apple’s HomePod costs £319, the Sonos One costs £199 and the Sonos Play:5 costs £499.The Google Home Max is one big sound upgrade for Google Assistant, producing powerful, room-filling sound and booming bass.While Google Assistant is the best voice assistant available right now, with the widest range of music services and most capable voice recognition and understanding, the Home Max doesn’t quite match the exquisite audio produced by the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos Play:5.If you want a speaker to blast out music at a party or in the kitchen, the Home Max is brilliant. If you want a top-end living room listening experience to replace a great hi-fi, then at £400 this isn’t quite there yet.Pros: Google Assistant is great, multi orientation, loud and punchy, can always hear you, Bluetooth and analogue in, native Spotify and multiple other music services, adaptive sound, granular volume control via percentage, good touch controlsCons: variable volume in playlists, not much good for a non-Google user, smart speaker privacy concerns, better for some music genres than others, expensive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a680c9ec13f20d34f85a464d86f942b0a11daea6/0_347_5200_3120/master/5200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6c17bffe82f59c89a56502cdc0b7f926","title":"julia salazar democratic socialist interview","story":"The 27-year-old Latina socialist speaks about the flurry of national interest in her run for New York senate and ‘extraordinary’ current political momentIt’s been two months since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez stunned the Democratic establishment by beating Joe Crowley in a Democratic primary for US congress. Now Julia Salazar, a fellow Democratic socialist, is hoping to recreate that victory, in what would be another boost for the progressive left.Salazar is challenging Martin Dilan, a 16-year Democratic incumbent, for a seat in the New York state senate. A member of the Democratic Socialists of America, her campaign was moving along relatively quietly until an endorsement from Ocasio-Cortez led to a surge in donations, and a flurry of national interest in Salazar’s run.We meet at Salazar’s campaign office, a former cafe in the midst of Bushwick, a once blue-collar neighborhood at the heart of New York’s gentrification debate. To the west of the office, bustling with enthusiastic young volunteers, lies the industrial warehouses that represent Bushwick’s past, to the east a slew of trendy e bars and restaurants that represent its rapidly changing present. District 18 also includes Williamsburg and Greenpoint, two neighborhoods which have seen huge population change over the last decade, as younger people have moved in and rents have increased.Sitting in the backyard beneath a pop-up canopy, the 27-year-old is a quiet, thoughtful presence, more at home discussing the affordable housing crisis in New York’s district 18 on a one-on-one basis than she she is on the campaign stump.“I’m naturally shy and soft spoken and introverted. So it’s very unnatural and counterintuitive for me to be doing something like this, to be a political candidate. And at the beginning of the campaign it was like, the most stressful thing,” she says.“But because I was thrown into the deep end, I had to swim.”Salazar was born in Miami to a cargo pilot father and flight attendant mother. Her father, who died when she was 18, was Colombian, and the family had moved there for a short time before Salazar returned to south Florida with her mother as a young child. She moved to New York in 2010 to attend Columbia University, and worked as an organizer for the non-profit organization Jews for Racial and Economic Justice before launching her campaign.Prior to that, Salazar says she “didn’t have any political ambitions” and had never planned to run for office. But early this year activist friends began pushing for her to challenge Dilan, a former member of the New York city council, and in March she agreed. Salazar launched her campaign in April, and has spent the past few months going door to door and holding events at homes around the district. She faces Dilan in the 13 September primary.Ocasio-Cortez’s victory over Crowley in June brought attention to Democratic socialists across the country, and Salazar is no exception. Both Salazar and Ocasio-Cortez are Latina women in their 20s, which has brought further comparisons between the two.“It had a huge impact on how much attention people were paying to this race: much, much more than your average state senate race,” says Salazar.“In that regard alone it was a big boost to me and to people who were suddenly paying attention and recognizing that this is actually extraordinary.”Salazar campaigned for Ocasio-Cortez during her run against Crowley, and has been endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez since then. In the 48 hours following Ocasio-Cortez’s victory, Salazar took in $20,000 in donations, “many of them for $27”, she says, which was the average amount that people donated to Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.When Salazar is out going door-to-door speaking to residents, which she has been doing six days a week, her political orientation rarely comes up. “I get more questions about it from the press,” she says – but does get asked about it and believes Democratic- Socialism is “becoming more normalized”.“I am really eager to talk about it if it comes up. But even when it does, I’ve heard from other canvassers who have mentioned it: ‘She’s Democratic socialist running,’ people don’t even blink. It doesn’t faze them.”Instead, Salazar focuses on increasing the amount of affordable housing. She has criticized Dilan, the incumbent, for being ineffective as rent has increased and forced families out of the neighborhood – claims Dilan has rebutted, saying he has an unimpeachable voting record on housing.Salazar’s run certainly seems to have the Dilan camp feeling threatened. The state senator has hired a lobbying firm and has issued a series of forceful attacks on Salazar’s past as a registered Republican, on her anti-abortion beliefs while in college she was president of the Columbia Right to Life organization at Columbia University, and on her residency in the district.“She claims to be fighting against gentrification when she herself is a gentrifier, living in an expensive market rate apartment, built with city subsidies with no provision or inclusion of affordable apartments,” said Bob Liff, a spokesman for Dilan.“She is trying to claim the mantle of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when she has not earned it and does not deserve it.”Salazar defends that history as a product of being raised in what she says was a “very politically conservative home”.“We weren’t by any means politically active. But Fox News was on this little TV in our kitchen all the time. I was raised by a single mom, who was very working class, no college degree. So I had a lot of mis-education about abortion and about a lot of issues.”Despite their different politics, Salazar’s mother is fully supportive of her campaign. As well as that Ocasio-Cortez endorsement, Salazar has also been backed by Cynthia Nixon, who is currently mounting a leftwing campaign against New York governor Andrew Cuomo, and Zephyr Teachout, a progressive who is running for New York attorney general.If Salazar can win in September it would be another victory for a young Democratic socialist over a more establishment figure in New York, and another boon for the Democratic Socialists of America. It might also be a further sign that, slowly, the Democratic party is being dragged to the left."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f268fc606e2e944084bf5d0f0601dc8bf146a26/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32bcff29194121956370c86d0127416d","title":"thursday briefing red card for energy drinks","story":"Children to be banned from caffeine-laced, sugary soft drinks … Dyson ramps up to make electric car … and Hillary Swank returns to the screenGood morning – it’s Warren Murray here to help you take it all in.The sale to children of high-caffeine, high-sugar drinks such as Red Bull and Monster Energy will be banned in England.

Photograph: Frank Miller The Government has said it is constitutionally bound to hold the Presidential inauguration on the centenary of the Armistice. On Tuesday, Minister for the Environment Eoghan Murphy announced the Presidential election will be held by October 26th and the inauguration on November 11th, 100 years to the day after the end of the first World War. A spokesman for Leo Varadkar said the Taoiseach is committed to marking the Armistice having becoming the first holder of the office to wear a poppy as he did in the Dáil last year. However, he said it was a constitutional imperative to inaugurate the president first. “To have the President at the commemoration, we need to have an inauguration first,” he said. “It is something the Taoiseach has been particularly mindful of in embracing all traditions on this island. Absolutely, the Armistice will be marked.” The spokesman pointed to the provision in the Constitution which states: “Every subsequent President shall enter upon his office on the day following the expiration of the term of office of his predecessor.” President Higgins’ term of office expires at midnight on November 10th.Labour Party leader Brendan Howlin has called for the date of inauguration to be put back. The Minister for Health Simon Harris on Wednesday said the Government will reflect on the timing of the inauguration and it wished to ensure that “Ireland continues to commemorate and recognise the participation of Irish iniduals in world wars”.“I think as a country we have shown a maturity in relation to this in recent years which is very welcome in commemorating a whole range of events in a sensitive manner.” More Irishmen fought and died in the first World War than in any other conflict. According to the historian Tom Burnell, 29,450 who died were from what is now the Republic of Ireland, suggesting a figure of 45,000 for the whole island. Some 270,000 Irishmen and women served in either the British armed force or those of the Commonwealth or American armies. A spokesman for Mr Murphy said the Government had no discretion in setting the date for the inauguration. “It is not a date at all. It is a constitutional matter. If we moved the inauguration, it would mean that we would have no President on Armistice Day,” he said.He pointed out that President Higgins was inaugurated on November 11th, 2011. His predecessor Mary McAleese was also inaugurated in both 1997 and 2004 on Armistice Day. Mr Murphy’s spokesman said the inauguration and the marking of the centenary of the Armistice were “not mutually exclusive” events and a morning inauguration will give the newly-elected President, whoever he or she might be, time to take part in the Armistice commemorations. NUIG law professor Tom O’Malley said he agreed with the Government.“I think the Government is probably right and if the inauguration was left until after November 11th then there would be a vacancy and I’m not sure that is provided for by the Constitution,” he said. He said while there was a line in the Constitution that says a new president has to be inaugurated on the day after a former president leaves office there is an additional clause which says “or as soon as may be thereafter”.He said that may give the Government “some wiggle room” but added that the “basic principle is there shouldn’t be any gap in the presidency if it is unnecessary so they are probably stuck with November 11th.” He said it could depend on how the word thereafter was interpreted but he expressed the view that “there should be continuity of the presidency”.DCU’s Dr Tom Hickey, who works in the fields of constitutional law and political theory, echoed the views of Mr O’Malley and while he said the language in the relevant clause of the Constitution might allow for a delay in an inauguration, such a move would be unlikely. The Armistice commemorations will be run by the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. A spokesman for Minister Josepha Madigan said: “The Department is aware of the coincidence of dates and is working with relevant departments to consider appropriate options to commemorate Armistice Day.“The Government is mindful that November 11th marks the 100th anniversary of the end of World War 1. The Taoiseach and other members of the Government have participated in Armistice Day commemorations in previous years and will give consideration as to how best to commemorate this significant anniversary.” The first World War ended at 11am on November 11th, 1918. Commemorations to mark the centenary will take place across the world on that date. Danny Boyle, the film director who choreographed the London Olympic opening ceremony, has been put in charge of marking the Armistice in Britain. It is expected that Queen Elizabeth II will mark the Armistice by inviting German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to the ceremonies in London as a mark of reconciliation between the two countries."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611547.1535560761!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how se%C3%A1n gallagher nearly became president of ireland in 2011","story":"Businessman Seán Gallagher has announced he is to seek a nomination to run in the presidential election in October. Video: Seán Gallagher\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeán Gallagher reacts as Martin McGuinness tackles him on the issue of a Fianna Fáil fundraiser. Photograph: RTÉSeán Gallagher almost became president in 2011 until his campaign imploded in the final days of the campaign. But what exactly happened?It had been, as everyone wearily attested, a bruising campaign. But the opinion polls on the final weekend all bore the same message: Gallagher was on course to be the next president of Ireland.The 49-year-old Cavan native, who described himself as an entrepreneur and community activist but was best known as a panellist on the TV programme Dragons’ Den, had come from nowhere to the brink of the country’s highest office.As the campaigns of better-known candidates like David Norris, Dana and Mary Davis had wilted under intense media scrutiny, or never really got going in the first place – as in the case of Gay Mitchell and Martin McGuinness – support for Gallagher had grown continuously.Now, with polling day just a few days away, his position appeared unassailable.The secret of Gallagher’s success was hard to fathom it is probably fair to say that he was nobody’s idea of a president before the campaign began.Someone more different than all the previous holders of the office, it would be hard to imagine. But in an Ireland that had been stunned by the economic crash and ravaged by the ensuing austerity, his blend of sunny optimism, plain speaking and relentless talk of recovery had struck a chord with people desperate for a signal towards a better future. He was, apparently, an outsider to the discredited political establishment.But he had the most indispensable quality of a successful politician – people liked him. He made them believe things could be better.How much of this was by design or accident is impossible to know now. But allied to a growing, if subterranean, realisation among Fianna Fáilers – until very recently the largest political organisation in the country, don’t forget – that he was essentially one of them, his rise in the polls had been relentless.With four days to go to polling, he was clear of the chasing pack – polls put him on 40 per cent, 38 per cent, 41 per cent and 40 per cent, will Michael D Higgins trailing in the mid to high 20s. Only a political earthquake could stop him now.“Seven people. One job. The final debate. What will happen here tonight will impact on voters’ decisions, so there’s clearly a lot at stake.”When the programme began a few minutes later, the candidates were offered an opening statement to set out their stalls for the presidency. Most of it had all been heard before.But McGuinness had prepared an attack on Gallagher which would change the course of the election.He went on to say that he had been contacted by a man who had attended a Fianna Fáil fundraiser in Dundalk in 2008 where he had paid €5,000 and had been given a photograph of himself with then taoiseach Brian Cowen.Gallagher had called round to his house to collect the cheque, he said. “The cronyism, the developers, the speculators and those who effectively destroyed the economy of this country, and Seán is up to his neck in all of that and he can’t deny it,” McGuinness said.Kenny turned to Gallagher.“You’re as thick as thieves with Fianna Fáil and you’re trying to deny it?”Haltingly, Gallagher explained his association with Fianna Fáil, painting a picture of largely peripheral involvement. He had been asked to invite “perhaps three or four” local businessmen to a fundraiser. He denied he had solicited or collected money.McGuinness repeated it. “I would caution you Seán, at this stage, that you are in very murky waters,” he warned.“I can tell you quite clearly,” Gallagher explained, “I invited perhaps two to three people to that event. At the event people were asked if they’d like a photograph, as is normal at these functions, and I personally delivered – if that’s the case I don’t remember it – delivering a photograph, but I can tell you . . . ”McGuinness interjected to say he had called to the man’s house to collect a cheque for €5,000.“That’s not correct,” Gallagher replied.McGuinness grinned broadly. “I have to say you’re in deep, deep trouble.”In fact, the story of the fund-raiser was not new. The previous week, the Irish Independent had reported that Gallagher has asked “business friends” to pay €5,000 to “dine with Cowen”. But now Gallagher was adding faces, names, photographs, cheques and envelopes to the story. And for the first time in the campaign, he looked rattled. Seriously rattled.Questions had also been circulated about some of Gallagher’s business dealings. Firms promised investment on Dragons’ Den did not receive the full amounts pledged on air. Gallagher had been paid huge amounts by companies which it turned out were struggling. Some of his companies had received significant State grants.Back on Frontline, an audience member raised specific questions about a cheque for €89,000 for one of these companies that had been misdirected to Gallagher’s personal account. It was a mistake, Gallagher said, and had later been rectified. But the hammer blow was yet to come.Returning after a commercial break, Kenny announced there had been “a development on the Martin McGuinness for President Twitter account. Sinn Féin are going to produce the man who gave you the cheque for five grand.”“You know who it is?” Kenny asked Gallagher.“Yes,” Gallagher said. He was a fuel-smuggler, a convicted criminal and someone with links to Sinn Féin. But he didn’t want to get involved in this. He was shouted down by the audience.Kenny asked, incredulously: “You went to a fuel-smuggler’s house and invited him to a Fianna Fáil do?”Gallagher was floundering now, trying to explain that he had been asked to invite local businessmen. “What I have done – I may well have delivered the photograph – if he gave me an envelope” – here the audience hooted again – “If he gave me the cheque , it was made out to Fianna Fáil headquarters, and it was delivered and that was that. It was nothing to do with me.”It was riveting television. Gallagher, the presidential frontrunner, was unravelling before the eyes of 900,000 viewers at a critical point in the campaign. But to RTÉ’s excruciating embarrassment, the tweet turned out to be from a fake account. But this was never acknowledged during the programme.In December 2017, after years of legal exchanges, RTÉ apologised in the High Court to Gallagher and paid him what he described as “substantial damages” for his treatment by the programme.A 2012 decision by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland upheld Gallagher’s complaints that he had been treated unfairly. RTÉ also conducted its own review of the programme, which found that while Gallagher had been subjected to tough questioning, Higgins had not.But it was not just the tweet, or the Frontline programme that derailed Gallagher’s bid. The following morning, in a bid to rescue his campaign, he appeared on Pat Kenny’s radio show.Asked to address the question about his business dealings put to him by the audience member who described herself as a businesswoman, Gallagher testily replied: “Who is the businesswoman, what’s her background, and where does she come from, and what party is she attached to? I’m tired of people being wheeled out with agendas. You put that person here in front of me and let them tell you and me and the nation their background.”Later he demanded: “You don’t know why she was there or her political background . . . Is she on somebody else’s campaign team? Is she a member of a political party?”A few moments later, Gallagher got his answer. The woman, Glenna Lynch, rang the show. They put her straight on air.“I’m so shocked. I was driving on my way to see someone, a client in work and I had to stop the car. It’s absolutely shocking,” she said.Gallagher was in free-fall now.The final phase of his spectacular fall would not come until that evening, when he was interviewed live on RTÉ’s Six One News by Bryan Dobson.In a relentless, forensic dissection of Gallagher and his campaign’s accounts of his fundraising activities, Dobson secured an admission by Gallagher that contrary to his spokesman’s previous denials to journalists, he had recruited donors and solicited money for Fianna Fáil.In 2011, with the economic crash still the central feature of Irish life, it was hard to construe a more damaging admission. It undermined the central appeal of Gallagher’s campaign – that he was untainted by the failed politics of the past.“The allegation is made that there is something corrupt,” Gallagher pleaded.“There is no allegation of corruption,” Dobson replied. “The allegation is that you haven’t been telling the truth.”“I always tell the truth,” Gallagher insisted.But his campaign was now a flameout.

Video: Alex Salmond\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer first minister of Scotland Alex Salmond. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA Wire Former Scottish National Party leader Alex Salmond has resigned from the party he headed for 20 years amid allegations of sexual harassment.Mr Salmond, who strongly denies the claims against him, said he was giving up his membership to avoid potential isions within the party.The former first minister of Scotland also announced a crowd-funding campaign to help with his costs in a legal action against the Scottish government.Opposition parties have attacked the fundraising move as “astonishing” and “unbelieveable”.Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister and SNP leader, voiced her “huge sadness” in the wake of his decision but said she understood why her mentor for three decades had chosen to relinquish his party membership.Mr Salmond made the revelation in a video message posted online on Wednesday evening.He stated: “I have been a member of the Scottish National Party for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as first minister of Scotland.“I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service . . .“I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. They have been the defining commitment of my life.“But today I have written to the national secretary of the party resigning my membership.”Two complaints, denied by Mr Salmond, were raised in January against him and he was informed of an investigation in March.Mr Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish government to contest the complaints process activated against him, with papers lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday.Ms Sturgeon had faced calls from opposition parties to suspend Mr Salmond from the SNP after the allegations emerged, but she insisted there was “no legal basis” to do so.However, in his latest statement, Mr Salmond indicated he wanted to avoid a potential internal split within the SNP.He said: “I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack.“Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal ision.”He added that it was his “absolute intention to reapply for SNP membership just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name”.In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said: “I feel a huge sadness about this whole situation. Alex has been my friend and mentor for almost 30 years and his contribution to the SNP and the independence movement speaks for itself.“While the decision to resign has been Alex’s alone, I understand why he has chosen to separate the current questions he is facing from the day-to-day business of the SNP and the ongoing campaign for independence.”She added that the complaints received by the government “could not be ignored or swept under the carpet”.The allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, emerged last week.Police Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints had been passed to the force.Mr Salmond reiterated his strong denial of the allegations in the video message, saying: “Let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.”Earlier this week, he wrote to Scotland’s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.“In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,” Mr Salmond said in the message.“It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.”He said his “entire focus” was now on preparing for the judicial review proceedings at Scotland’s highest civil court and he launched a crowd-funder to help with costs.The Scottish Government has said it will defend its position “vigorously” in court.Opposition parties have attacked the fundraising campaign.A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: “Scotland now faces the incredible and unprecedented situation of its most famous former first minister appealing to SNP supporters for cash to take legal action against the government he used to run.”Scottish Labour’s Rhoda Grant MSP accused Mr Salmond of “dragging Scotland into the gutter”. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611674.1535566439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says no deal brexit the only alternative to chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab at the parliamentary committee on Wednesday. “You have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said.  Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritain has warned the European Union that a no-deal Brexit is the only alternative to Theresa May’s proposal for partial membership of the single market. Cabinet secretary David Lidington, Ms May’s de facto deputy, told a French business conference that it was too late to come up with alternative proposals for a future economic relationship.“With exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission, or the risk of there being no deal,” he said.“The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered. So, we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.”Ms May’s proposal, agreed at Chequers last month, would keep Britain in the single market for goods and agricultural products but not for services. Britain would follow EU regulations for goods but would not offer free movement to EU citizens and would leave the customs union.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that the EU was prepared to offer Britain a partnership “such as has never been with any other third country”. But he stressed that Britain must respect the EU’s core structures, saying that “single market means single market”, before adding that “this is not negotiable”.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that Mr Barnier was not making himself available for negotiations and expressed confidence that a deal can be agreed. He acknowledged that the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard Border remained the biggest stumbling block in the negotiations.“The prime minister has been clear . . . that the EU’s proposals are unacceptable, mainly because of the effect they would have on the UK common market and the constitutional integrity of the UK,” he said.Mr Raab told the House of Lords EU committee that Britain continued to insist that the backstop must be time-limited and he suggested that EU law might also require it to be temporary.“As a matter of law under article 50 there are constraints on the period of time for which a backstop could last. Obviously, ultimately that has to be tested,” he said.The Brexit secretary said that votes in the House of Commons on amendments to Brexit-related legislation demonstrated that opposition parties shared the government’s determination to reject any backstop that could undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the UK.\u0026nbsp“It was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don’t just have a Conservative and unionist government, but we also have a unionist parliament. On all the amendments that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border in the Irish Sea, parliament clearly supported the government’s position. So you have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

British backpacker who died after taking their traditional hallucinogenic drugs, an inquest has heard. Henry Miller quickly fell ill after taking part in a ceremony with a local tribe in Colombia where he drank yage, also known as ayahuasca, which brings on vivid hallucinations and supposedly spiritual experiences.The inquest into his death heard that ritual leader Shaman Guillermo, his wife Mama Concha, their son and his friend, have since been put on trial by the local indigenous community following Mr Miller\u0027s death. In a letter to his family, they shared their remorse.

He said in a statement that nerves got the better of him, and that he waited nearby until he heard police arrived. Emily Brown, a Foreign Office official who attended their trial in Colombia, said in a statement: “They were touched by the contents of the letter and offered their condolences to the family.“They repeated it was never their intention to harm Henry with their medicine and the values of their community was to share with others.“They claimed this case was a first for their community and they have now realised about not sharing with foreigners without some thought about the process.”A yage ceremony in La Calera, Colombia. File pictureShe also reported that Mr Miller was given a single leaf of scopolamine before the ceremony began. In a statement read at his inquest his father, David Miller, said his son had told them he had already attended a ceremony at the Shaman\u0027s cabin two days previously and had drunk three cups of yage, but had felt nothing.Mr Miller had left the UK two months earlier to travel to South America and was due to begin his studies at the University of Brighton in September 2014.Christopher Deardon, who was also travelling in Colombia with his girlfriend Elena, met Mr Miller while the student was staying at a nearby hostel run by a retired Belgian police officer. He told the hearing that each ceremony cost 50,000 Colombian pesos and he took part in the first one with Mr Miller.Describing Henry as a curious young man, he noted that the Colombian ceremonies were clearly of interest to him. In a statement describing taking the drug, he added: I was the first one to throw up and have hallucinations. I looked at Elena and Henry but they felt nothing.Yage, a mixture of the Ayahuasca hallucinogenic liana and a psychoactive bush, attracts many people in ColombiaDescribing the second ritual, he Mr Deardon said Mama Concha invited Mr Miller to step up to drink a small cup with herbs, to facilitate his reaction to the yage.None of us knew what this was. Then we all drank our cups. I threw up after about 15 minutes, and when I came back, Henry seemed to be feeling the effects straight away.The following morning, the police showed up at the camp, asking why they were there and whether they had attended the previous night\u0027s ceremony, before informing Mr Deardon that a boy named Henry had been reported missing.Ignatius Hughes QC, representing the Miller family, said the family wanted other travellers to be aware of the dangers of taking part in these tribal ceremonies.“Any anxiety generally is that I should alert the court to their concern that other young travellers might benefit from being made aware of the small but real dangers inherent in this perfectly lawful practice,” he said.“We understand from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that consideration is being given to a standard message to travellers when they visit the FCO website for that part of the world.”Coroner Maria Voisin recorded a conclusion of accidental death and said she would be writing to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office highlighting the findings of the inquest.“We know there are a lot of students and young people travelling in that part of the world and I will be making such a report,” she said.“I will be phrasing it in such a way to encourage some standard message warning about this ceremony.”Please review our commenting policyFears of a far-Right mole in German police

immediate threat to the public’s health and will “severely impact” nurses’ and midwives’ ability to provide safe care, the\u0026nbspRoyal College of Nursing\u0026nbsp(RCN) said on Wednesday.More than 715,000 people have already\u0026nbspbacked The Independent’s Final Say campaign calling on Theresa May to accept a second vote to ensure key issues are solved before leaving, and avoid crashing out

British Medical Association, and leading politicians of all stripes.With more than 100,000 staff vacancies across the NHS, 40,000 of them nurses, the RCN has been vocal about the harms of a “botched Brexit” and the risk of making it more difficult to attract nurses.It says a second referendum will ensure the public has the chance to make an informed decision on the terms of the UK’s exit, two and a half years after it voted to leave.In the letter RCN chair of council Maria Trewern warns that as well as staff numbers Brexit has particular problems for the health service in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland if it leads to a hard border being reintroduced.Ms Trewern said: “As the debate across our membership has made clear, the implications of Brexit for the health and care system will be numerous.“There are risks that, if not credibly addressed, may damage population health, as well as severely impact on our members’ ability to provide safe and effective care for their

expert\u0026nbsppredicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent in the event of a disruptive exit from the EUClick to followThe IndependentUK asking prices fell by £7,000 in August, recent figures showedHouse prices in London are set to fall this year and next, and could crash if a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspoccurs, according to a Reuters poll of property experts and analysts. Respondents predicted prices in the capital will fall 1.6 per cent this year\u0026nbspand 0.1 per cent in 2019, although for the UK in general they are set to rise 2 per cent this year and next, and 2.3 per cent in 2020. The national average price for a property was £301,973 in August, and in London it rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019, the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest response 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates. However\u0026nbsprisks lie substantially to the downside,” said Andrew Brigden, at Fathom Consulting.“Were interest rates to return to pre-crisis levels, or higher – which may prove necessary if there were a sharp fall in sterling after a general election, for example – then house prices could fall by around 40 per cent.”UK house prices should be frozen for five years, think tank saysThis London area has seen the highest 20-year house price growth in UKThe Bank of England recently raised interest rates above 0.5 per cent for the first time since the financial crisis, and said the rate would continue to increase at a gradual pace over the next few years. Survey respondents also noted the weaker pound – sterling fell to a one year low against the euro this week – should be attracting foreign investors to the UK property market, but said uncertainty around Brexit was keeping them away. Recent data from\u0026nbspRightmove showed asking prices in the UK dropped by more than £7,000 in August, due to more sellers arriving on the market.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/26/12/walls.jpg","title":"deport families remove detain children home office inspectors report tinsley house gatwick","story":"Created with Sketch.Campaigners say detaining families with no likely chance of removing them feeds\u0026nbspinto\u0026nbsphostile environment\u0026nbspand amounts\u0026nbspto \u0027brutal and unnecessary\u0027\u0026nbsptactic\u0026nbspto drive down immigrationClick to followThe IndependentInspectors observed children being woken early in the morning by arrest teams and escorted on long journeys before being detained with their “often very distressed” parentsAttempts by the Home Office to deport families by detaining them in dawn raids are\u0026nbspharmful to children – as well as being\u0026nbsplargely ineffective, the prisons watchdog has warned.The chief inspector of prisons said he was “troubled” by a recent inspection into the practice, which observed children being woken early in the morning by arrest teams and escorted on long journeys before being detained with their “often very distressed” parents.Some were forced to go through the “traumatic process” of witnessing parents being restrained, contributing\u0026nbspto the “considerable human impact” the removal process had on children, inspectors found.Unaccompanied children detained for more than 10 hours at HeathrowRed Cross calls for overhaul of UK’s immigration detention systemHome Office separating scores of children from parentsThe report\u0026nbspby the HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, which looked at the care of families held at immigration facilities near Gatwick, found that as well as being harmful for children, detaining families was “costly” and “often ineffective”, with 80 per cent of detainees released back into the community within three days.Campaigners said the practice of detaining families with no likely chance of removing them fed into Theresa May’s hostile environment, and amounted to a “brutal and unnecessary” tactic\u0026nbspwith the aim of trying to drive down immigration.The report looked at two new family detention facilities which opened at Tinsley House in June 2017, replacing the Cedars pre departure accommodation which\u0026nbsphad been used for families arrested at the border and who needed\u0026nbspovernight accommodation before a return flight.In the 11 months since the new facility opened, 19 families have been detained in the pre departure accommodation, with\u0026nbsponly four of them eventually removed.Inspectors observed the arrest of two families, both of which\u0026nbspinvolved more than eight people in uniforms and wearing stab vests and heavy boots, entering a family’s home early in the morning.\u0026nbspDuring the first arrest – of a father, mother, eight-year old boy, five-year old girl and 15-month old baby boy – staff were unsuccessful in efforts to find\u0026nbspan interpreter and used telephone interpretation instead, which made communication difficult. \u0026nbspThe parents were arrested and asked to get themselves and their children dressed while a\u0026nbsplarge number of officers were in the flat, with one telling them: “We can do this the easy way or the hard way.”The family members\u0026nbspwere promised they would be able to speak to a legal representative when they arrived at the local immigration enforcement office only to be denied the opportunity.The family endured an 11 hour coach journey which ended at\u0026nbsp9.55pm, after being arrested at 7.15am. They were ultimately released back into the community.The second family consisted of a mother, father and two children – a boy aged 13 and a girl aged eight – and the detention was\u0026nbspparticularly traumatic because restraint was used on the father and, briefly, his eldest child. They too were ultimately not deported.Inspectors found, despite the arrests being a distressing and high risk process, where force was often used, Home Office immigration enforcement teams did not routinely use body worn video cameras to safeguard staff and detainees.Responding to the findings, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott told The Independent: “This feeds into Theresa May’s hostile environment.\u0026nbspNo child should be detained, and the traumatic nature of these detention tactics are brutal and unnecessary.“Britain’s current immigration detention system is inhumane, costly and not fit for purpose. The government needs to end the current, disastrous immigration detention system, and ... end the failed ‘hostile environment’ approach.”Celia Clarke, director of Bail for Immigration Detainees (BID), said the charity agreed with the inspector’s observations, adding:\u0026nbsp”The distress and trauma inflicted on families subjected to these processes cannot ever be justified in the name of immigration control.\u0026nbsp“The enduring harm inflicted on children during these attempted removals can never be undone.\u0026nbspThe forced detention and removal of families, which rarely achieves its stated purpose, must stop.”The latest study came\u0026nbspafter a\u0026nbspreport by the Independent Monitoring Board (IMB)\u0026nbspthat found more than a thousand children were detained at Heathrow airport last year, including babies and unaccompanied minors who spent more than 10 hours in holding rooms.The Home Office promotes “voluntary return” and offered families assistance to\u0026nbsphelp them avoid detention. Since April 2016, more than 1,300 families have been returned, having not been detained.\u0026nbspA Home Office spokesperson said: “Detention is an important part of the immigration system – but it must be fair, dignified and protect the most vulnerable.“This report makes many positive findings, including the good relationship between staff and detainees, however it rightly points out areas where we can do better, and we are committed to improving. \u0026nbspUK news in picturesBritain\u0027s shop prices have risen for the first time in more than five years as the UK\u0027s sweltering summer heatwave sent the cost of fruit and vegetables soaring.Prime Minister Theresa May meets students and staff at I.D.

And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.\u0026nbspSince 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in Discretionary Housing Payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.\u0026nbsp“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”Chartered Institute of HousingEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6030851  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt= Brexit campaign  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/25/12/brexit-so-far-1.jpg","title":"brexit latest barnier raab lidington no deal eu berlin pound sterling spike jump","story":"Created with Sketch.Pound rallies on apparent good news but fundamentals appear unchanged – so farClick to followIndy PoliticsEU says it will offer UK post-Brexit deal ‘unlike any it has given another country’The EU is prepared to offer Britain a trade deal unlike any it has ever offered another country, the bloc\u0027s chief Brexit negotiator has said.Michel Barnier however reiterated that the European Union\u0026nbspwould not ide or change the single market for Britain, warning: “We respect Britain\u0027s red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are.”Though Mr\u0026nbspBarnier has repeatedly said the bloc is ready to offer its “most ambitious” free trade agreement ever to Britain, markets appeared to interpret his latest comments as suggesting he was close to a deal – causing sterling to jump up by 1 per cent.\u0026nbsp“We are prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country,” the negotiator told reporters following a meeting with the German foreign minister in Berlin.But Theresa May’s unofficial Brexit minister David Lidington, who coordinates Cabinet activity around leaving the EU, said the UK would only accept the Chequers deal or a no-deal.“With exactly seven months until the end of the article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European commission, or no deal,” he told French business leaders in a speech on Wednesday.“I truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.”Still speaking in Berlin on the same day Mr Barnier said the Norway model was available to Britain if it wanted access to the single market he has previously said the only model which would cause no disruption was membership of the single market and a customs union with the EU.Theresa May’s Chequers proposal, which Mr Barnier has effectively ruled out, asks for frictionless trade based on access to the single market for goods through a “common rulebook”, as well as no customs checks through a bespoke customs system.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

He recently launched a campaign ad in which he urged\u0026nbsphis toddler daughter to build that wall with toy blocks, referring to the president\u0027s plan to build a wall with Mexico.But Mr Putnam, state agriculture commissioner, has used the presidential nod to his advantage, portraying his opponent as little more than a Trump stooge as part of his appeal to the party\u0027s establishment.A late poll conducted by Florida Politics\u0026nbspputs Mr DeSantis\u0026nbspin the lead with 57 per cent to Mr Putnam\u0027s 33 per cent, with 10 per cent refusing to commit.Among the Democrats, Gwen Graham, a former member of Congress and daughter of governor and senator Bob Graham, leads the field and is expected to win.Her rivals for the nomination include Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum, a left-leaning favourite of Bernie Sanders, could make a late surge, while former Miami Beach mayor Philip Levine and Palm Beach businessman Jeff Greene have their fans and have significant financial backing. Orlando entrepreneur Chris King is also in contention.Florida Politics polling\u0026nbspputs Ms Graham ahead with 32 per cent of the vote, Mr Gillum on 25 per cent, Mr Levine on 22 per cent, Mr Greene on 10 per cent and Mr King on 2 per cent. Nine per cent were undecided.The anticipated winners will be Mr DeSantis and Ms Graham and the subsequent race is expected to be extremely close.The vote\u0026nbspcomes\u0026nbspjust days after the latest mass shooting, at a video game tournament\u0026nbspin Jacksonville, which could potentially impact upon voters at the ballot box, with Democratic candidates speaking out passionately against gun ownership laws.In Arizona, a Senate primary will see three senior Republicans bid to replace Jeff Flake, not seeking re-election: America\u0027s first female combat pilot Martha McSally, Dr Kelli Ward\u0026nbspand controversial former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, pardoned by President Trump over a contempt of court conviction.The contest has been overshadowed in recent days by the death on Saturday of John McCain,\u0026nbspArizona\u0027s longtime Republican senator.\u0026nbspAll three Republicans had distanced themselves from Mr McCain, who frequently feuded with Trump, and Ward suggested that his announcement before his death that he was stopping medical treatment was timed to hurt her campaign.Mr Trump has not endorsed a candidate and Ms McSally, the favourite,\u0026nbsphas faced questions over her loyalty to his cause.The Democratic candidates are former Green Party activist Kysten\u0026nbspSinema and attorney Deedra\u0026nbspAbboud, the former far better known, widely expected to win and expected to provide tough competition for the eventual Republican winner.Meanwhile, in the competition for state governor, the Republican incumbent Doug Ducey\u0026nbspis facing a challenge from his own side in Arizona\u0027s former secretary of state, Ken Bennett.Their Democratic rivals are David Garcia, a former Department of Education official, state senator Steve Farley and YMCA CEO Kelly Fryer.Mr Ducey is expected to see off his Republican challenger while Mr Garcia is broadly expected to win out among the Democrats and would represent a progressive choice, backing universal healthcare and campaign finance reform.Oklahoma will see Republicans Mick Cornett and Kevin Stitt\u0026nbspenter a run-off for the nomination to challenge Democrat Drew Edmondson\u0026nbspfor state governor, the latter securing his place in June, having previously run unsuccessfully in 2010.Mr Cornett is Oklahoma City mayor while Mr Stitt\u0026nbspis a Tulsa businessman offering himself as an outsider to the party establishment.The two have already been chosen among 10 candidates to replace Mary Fallin, whose term of office has expired and who was widely unpopular after mishandling the state budget, resulting in cuts to public school funding and a round of teacher\u0027s strikes.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social

to 15 years in prison, died in June 2017, days after he was repatriated to the US with severe brain damage.Their arrests were widely seen as politically motivated and had compounded the dire state of

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its GDP is growing rapidly. Similar to India, its middle classes are rocketing. And its workforce is estimated to be larger than China’s by 2035.Over 17 millions Brits voted for a Brexit that would make us a freer, richer country.This is exactly the type of buccaneering move that will make that vision a reality.THE EU’s threats regarding a No Deal Brexit are total bluster.The bloc claims there will be chaos if we leave without a deal, that the impact on trade and travel will be so severe we will crawl back to the negotiating table.But behind closed doors, the EU admits this is codswallop.The EU Commission has drawn up secret No Deal plans that are “very similar” to Britain’s Brexit preparation.In other words, in the event of a No Deal they will keep things almost exactly the same because they don’t want to be hit.What a surprise.WHEN will Labour moderates realise their party is beyond repair?Jewish Labour MPs need bodyguards for the party conference next month. There is a backlog of anti-Semitism complaints that could take YEARS to probe. And their leader is an ­anti-Semitic IRA-apologist, who counts the former BNP leader and the KKK among his cheerleaders.By staying in the party, Labour MPs signal that they want Corbyn to be PM.No amount of tribal loyalty can make them think that is a good idea.IT is shocking that deadly diet pills are being brazenly flogged on Instagram.The Facebook-owned company must better protect youngsters.It should hire a proper workforce to establish oversight of what is put online.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont enjoy the smell of vomit or stool, but the two mixed together was one of the worst things Ive ever smelled.One doctor on chat site Quora said one of the worst things he had witnessed was a patient battling a flesh-eating disease in his arm and leg that had maggots crawling around in it.And of course, theres US-based doctor Sandra Lee - aka Doctor Pimple Popper who has become a breakout star, with her videos of lancing giant boils  - some as big as bowling balls - as well as spots and cysts gaining a staggering five million views on YouTube.Earlier this year, Dr Lee even removed a unicorn horn worth of pus from a lump that had been growing on a mans head for six years.It took 20 minutes for the doctor to remove all of the pus - which poured out in a manner resembling cottage cheese - before stitching the resulting wound back together.But despite performing essential medical procedures in the surgery, Khan admits hes concerned that these services may not be available in the future.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Contact your energy firm as soon as you can and discuss your situation.It has to help you reach a solution, likely through a payment plan.This is where you pay a fixed-amount which you can afford over a set period of time.The plan will cover the debt you owe and the energy you are using now.If you cant reach an agreement, your supplier might insist on installing a pre-payment meter but this is only as a last resort.A government spokesperson said: “We spend £24bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000428041155.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"eus chief negotiator accused of avoiding brexit talks with dominic raab while posting pics from his holiday","story":"The pound soared after Michel Barnier’s comments that Britain could end up with an unprecedentedly close relationship with Brussels after it exits the bloc in March next year.Speaking in Berlin he appeared to break months of stalemate by saying: “We are prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country.”After holding meetings with German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, he added that the agreement could include economic as well as foreign and security policy ties.Mr Barnier has repeatedly said the UK will not be able to cherry pick its own bespoke agreement.He has stuck to the line that we will have to follow an existing model such as the relationship Norway or Canada currently enjoy with Brussels.But todays comments mark the most significant shift in rhetoric by the EUs top brass in months, and raises hopes of a deal being hammered out this autumn.And it is a significant boost for Theresa May, who has spent the summer trying to convince leaders across the continent to accept her White Paper proposals.However he also warned: “We respect Britains red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are.Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte.In response to Mr Barnier’s change in stance, sterling rallied sharply against both the dollar and the euro this afternoon as the markets reacted to the decreasing chance of there being a “no deal” Brexit.His comments came just as the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was appearing in front of Lords Committee to answer questions about how the EU negotiations were going.He rejected suggestions from a Labour peer that Theresa May’s Chequers agreement amounted to “begging for a deal, saying: “I don’t beg.”And he said he was prepared to play hardball with Brussels over our £39billion “divorce payment”, suggesting the UK could choose to withhold some of it if a long-term agreement cannot be agreed.The Cabinet minister added: Im confident that a deal is within our sights. Were bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.There was a light-hearted moment when Lord Liddle’s mobile phone went off in the committee room and Mr Raab joked: Its probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.He had been speaking about the UK’s plans for providing the EU with a the financial settlement, saying a “no-deal” scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU.Mr Raab said: The financial settlement, as its calibrated in the withdrawal agreement, reflects a whole range of considerations not just the strict legal obligations.“And if we left with no deal then not only would there be a question around quite what the shape of those financial obligations were as a matter of strict law, but secondly on the timing.Remember that the timing of payments is actually - we overlook it on our side - rather important on the EU side because of the way money is distributed.“But I dont think it could be safely assumed on anyones side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.It comes as Mr Barnier was accused of avoiding having more Brexit talks with Mr Raab because of diary issues - while also posting pictures from his holidayHe previously said he is available 24-7 for discussions with the Brexit Secretary – but the minister has complained his requests for discussions have been knocked back by Brussels.Earlier this month the pair vowed to speed up the drawn-out process of debating Theresa May’s Chequers plan with the autumn deadline for a deal looming.They said they would have “continuous talks” from then on, but today there are reports UK officials are “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to this promise.The two sides were due to spend this week locked in negotiations, but Mr Barnier only offered Mr Raab a three-hour slot this Friday because of his schedule commitments.It came after he tweeted an image of himself in the sunshine in eastern France on Sunday.The  reported that after complaints from the British side that has been extended to five hours, but it says diplomats have raised this issue several times.The newspaper reports that the EU commission’s claim, repeated by a spokesman on Tuesday, that Mr Barnier was available day or night has been proved to be false.Mr Raab hinted at his frustration when at a press conference last week he expressed hope for a longer meeting this week.And he also suggested a deal would require “energy on both sides”, as they admitted the October deadline for hammering out a deal had slipped to the end of the year.In response an EU official said: “The commission is working for a deal. Negotiation agendas, including meetings between principals, are decided jointly.“The aim of the meetings between the principals is to take stock of progress made at technical and coordinator level.”The Department for Exiting the European Union said: “Both the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are committed to weekly discussions to ensure that both sides get a good deal.”Responding to todays story Mr Raab said: I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday, I hope that gives you the facts directly with Michel Barnier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He was offered free legal services.In a tense Twitter exchange with a journalist he added: Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no.

Its more than double that Ive ever swum in my whole life.So there were concerns before I started about whether I would even finish this.”Mr Pugh aimed to highlight inadequate protection of UK waters through his ‘Speedo Diplomacy’, and has had conversations with Environmental Secretary Michael Gove – who was also on the beach to welcome him home – about the need for more Marine Protected Areas.Before setting off, he warned of a shocking figure that just seven square kilometres  out of 750,000 square kilometres of coastal waters are fully protected.He said: “This is a crisis - be under no illusion that the combination of climate change, over-fishing and pollution altogether now are devastating the oceans.The seven-week challenge also saw the environmental activist accompany marine conservation campaigners Surfers Against Sewage on beach cleans along the south coast.Members of the group joined him on the beach after taking part in a litter-picking exercise in anticipation of his arrival.After completing the “once-in-a-lifetime” swim, Mr Pugh said there were plans for swims in other countries, as other countries needed to protect their coastlines."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004225921841.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm bans sale of energy drinks kids","story":"The sweeping ban will also cover higher caffeine drinks like Monster that have been blamed for suicides and will apply to all retailers.The crackdown comes after supermarket regulations prohibiting under-16s from consuming the dangerous cans was branded a failure by health chiefs.Almost a third of teens have consumed the drinks - with a quarter of 6 to 9-year-olds admitting to buying the high-sugar beverages.The government is to launch at 12-week consultation on whether to set the ban at 16 or 18.Speaking during her Africa tour, the Prime Minister Theresa May said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children.“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”A Downing Street source added that on the ban that “it is a question of how, not whether we do it.”Existing industry labelling guidelines require any high caffeine drinks to carry a warning and state it is not recommended for children.But now the sale of any drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre is to be put under similar restrictions used to protect kids from fireworks and cigarettes in shops.Red Bull has more than 80mg of caffeine in a single 250ml can - putting it well within in the scope of the ban.Monster Energy which comes in 440ml cans has 140mg caffeine per serving.Ministers claim that excessive consumption of these drinks has already been linked to health issues in children like headaches, sleep problems, stomach aches and hyperactivity.And teachers claim the drinks lead to bad behaviour in the classrooms - with British adolescents consuming 50 per cent more cans than European school kids.Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: “We all have a responsibility to protect children from products that are damaging to their health and education, and we know that drinks packed to the brim with caffeine, and often sugar, are becoming a common fixture of their diet.Chief Executive of Public Health England Duncan Selbie added: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar“Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.”The measure comes in the next wave of the Childhood Obesity Strategy, but last night sparked an angry backlash from some in Government.One senior Minister hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day” after electric shock dog collars and clampdowns on single use plastic.They fumed: Every day, something else banned. Its just so depressing.However the move was welcomed by Jamie Oliver who said: “We have a massive problem with kids and energy drinks.The campaigning TV chef added: “Too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast.“Teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted in classrooms because of these drinks, packed with stimulants.He added: “It’s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids.“I’m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the Government this is the right thing to do.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to cut through the confusion and ease anxieties around allergies and make catering for affected people easier.Jo Johnson, from Asda, said: “We’re dedicated to helping make sure allergies and intolerances aren’t seen as a burden, or too difficult to cater for.Armed with the right help and advice, all households can become an inclusive environment.We really hope our guide will be a positive starting point for this and the beginning of the end to social exclusion of kids with specific food requirements” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Scottish Conservatives said he has \"some brass neck\" for \"an independently wealthy man\" to ask for cash while \"plunging the government he used to lead into chaos\".The two harassment complaints are reported to date from Mr Salmond\u0027s time as first minister, a position he held from 2007 to 2014, when Ms Sturgeon took over. Announcing his resignation on Twitter, Mr Salmond said, while he believed harassment claims should be treated seriously, he had concerns with the way information had come out.\"Confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,\" he said.\"It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.\"He said it is \"obvious\" that Ms Sturgeon is \"under pressure\" from other political parties to suspend him, \"given recent party precedents\".Mr Salmond added that he has \"always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations\" as the UK abides by the concept of innocent until proven guilty. Former deputy SNP leader Jim Sillars told Sky News he thought Mr Salmond had done the right thing by resigning as he has \"taken Nicola Sturgeon off the hook\" as calls for his suspension by opposition parties would otherwise dominate the Scottish Parliament on its return.\"It\u0027s very sad that it\u0027s happened,\" he told Sky News.\"I\u0027ve had my differences with Alex over many years but he\u0027s made a significant contribution to the SNP and the independence movement.,targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"Mr Salmond said that \"apart from a political spat back in the 1980s\" he has been a member of the SNP continuously for 45 years, 20 of them as leader and seven as first minister of Scotland.The politician was suspended from the SNP when the 79 Group, a socialist republican organisation within the SNP, was banned from the larger party in 1982.\"I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service,\" he said.\"I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. They have been the defining commitment of my life.\" But, he said it is his \"absolute intention\" to reapply for SNP membership when he has had \"the opportunity\" to clear his name - which he hopes to do by the end of the year.\"In the meantime I would urge no one else to relinquish their SNP membership,\" he added.The judicial review he is asking the public to fund relates to a new complaints procedure introduced by the Scottish government in December.The government has said it will \"defend our position vigorously\". The complaints about Mr Salmond were made in January, just weeks after the new harassment complaints procedure was introduced - with Ms Sturgeon\u0027s stamp of approval.Ms Sturgeon has admitted her relationship with Mr Salmond has left her in an \"extremely difficult situation\" and the case would be \"upsetting\" for the SNP.But, she added the complaints \"could not be ignored or swept under the carpet\"."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/08/2048x1152/skynews-languages-brexit_4405253.jpg?20180830034622 ","title":"brexit prompts surge in brits signing up to learn languages online","story":"Another poster, using the name Motodraconis, wrote: \"Though I am a British national  I am anticipating that I will lose my job because of Brexit\u0026#8230 I signed up to Duolingo a month after the vote, as my best hope of completing my research will be to go to Europe, most likely Germany or Austria  I really threw myself into German on Duolingo, reaching level 25 in 5 months.\"As this increase in sign-ups in March 2017 was limited to the UK, the company said it believes this made it \"it much more likely that Brexit was the cause\".\"It\u0027s interesting that some people actually did [try a new language],\" Mr von Ahn said, reflecting that many often say they will take action but don\u0027t.\"There is Google Translate and all that stuff but it\u0027s a completely different thing to speak the language yourself,\" he said.\"I don\u0027t think it\u0027ll ever get to the point where you can have a meaningful conversation with somebody through [tech, like] an ear bud,\" he said, adding, \"It works but it\u0027s not very comfortable.\"Duolingo say they have seen a similar effect in America with users on their forum saying they want to learn Russian in light of the investigation into whether Russia meddled in the US election.Although some of these posters may be joking, Mr von Ahn says: \"We also did see a pick up of Russian in the US.\",targeting:\" data-targeting-strnativekey=\"\" data-targeting-platform=\"\" data-tag=\"\" data-component-name=\"sdc-site-mpu\" aria-label=\"Advertisement\" id=\"mpu-inline-mobile\" data-tolerance=\"2\"Duolingo report they had over 865,000 active learners over the past year for Russian in the US.He added: \"My guess is a lot of these are initial [increases] and then dropped off.\"Mr von Ahn says the UK and US have similar trends, and that in both countries about half of Duolingo\u0027s users there are \"productive procrastinators\".\"A significant number of our users don\u0027t want to waste their time and so maybe do Duolingo rather than scrolling through Instagram or playing Candy Crush,\" he said.The most common language learnt in the UK changes.In the summer, studying Spanish increases from 28% in the winter to 51% in the summer.Users then move to study French more in the winter.Duolingo also offers smaller languages, including Welsh.They report than more than a million people have signed up for the Welsh course and there have been 340,000 active learners in the past year.Some 866,700 people who live in Wales say they can speak Welsh.Scottish politician Alasdair Allan, an SNP MSP, has been lobbying Duolingo to add Scottish Gaelic to the available languages.Before co-founding Duolingo, Mr von Ahn, 40, from Guatemala, sold reCaptcha, a security system used on forms to ensure that a computer user is human not a bot, and an image description game to Google in 2009.He speaks Spanish, English, Portuguese and is currently learning French."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/17/09/2048x1152/e670c6d12351c43edc6afa9e6685b6a20d5f5e9c767da8a1ea8266cfdc34b7e0_4104533.jpg?20170919055957 ","title":"france prepared to help forge eu deal with uk after brexit","story":"His words helped trigger a sharp rise for sterling, seeing the pound rise to its highest level for weeks.\"We respect Britain\u0027s red lines scrupulously,\" Mr Barnier said during a news conference in Berlin.\"In return, they must respect what we are.

These are just three of the many angels who have helped us along the way. There have been beacons of inspiration, too.Like the community in Lyme Bay that teamed up with an NGO to protect their marine environment or the efforts by scientists in Portsmouth to save the last remnants of what used to be the biggest oyster bed in Britain or the Plymouth family that galvanised their community to stand up to dumping in Whitsand Bay.They are all heroes. Despite these valiant efforts, the situation for our seas and oceans is dire. I have been deeply shocked by how little wildlife I have seen over the last 50 days, besides far too many jellyfish - and not just for my comfort level, but for the oceans, since these are an indicator species for the effects of climate change.The only other marine animals we\u0027ve seen over the 330 miles have been a few dolphins, one turtle which dived when I saw it, and a lone shark.

A UK-funded centre in the capital Nairobi will boost local police\u0027s battle to stop vile child porn images being distributed online, and help protect kids from suffering. Kenyan authorities currently miss out on vital reporting of child sexual abuse material from US-based global tech companies. Secure channels needed to share information do not exist in Kenya. But, fuelled by UK taxpayers\u0027 cash, the new specialist cyber centre will enable local crimefighters to access data, helping to snare web perverts.    Speaking as she prepared for the final day of her three-day trip to Africa, the Prime Minister said: “Online child exploitation is an abhorrent crime and we are determined to ensure there is no place to hide for predators who use the internet to share images of abuse across borders, too often with impunity. “This builds on our ongoing work with Kenya on security and criminal justice – a partnership which has already helped to convict and imprison terrorists in the UK.” The new centre – the first of its kind in Africa – will be based within Kenya’s anti-human trafficking and child protection unit, which is currently probing more than 100 cases of suspected abuse. Since March 2016 it has protected about 400 children and helped arrest around 40 suspects.

On Monday, 6,000 far-right protesters were involved in clashes in Chemnitz in Saxony, Germany. In Italy, the right-wing League is in government with the populist Five Star movement. The far-right Sweden Democrats could hold the balance of power after elections this autumn. It is a similar story in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Some fear the “great peace” – the 70-plus years of co-operation and security in Western Europe – is now under threat. The rise of the far-right has co\u0026shyincided with a decline of the centre-left. Of the 28 EU states, only six – Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia – have left-wing governments. The right’s tough line on migration has played well with some of the left’s traditional supporters. Prof Matthew Goodwin, of Kent University, says: “We have centre- left parties struggling with a new agenda of terrorism, immigration and the refugee crisis.” There are fears for the future of the EU. A poll for Reuters suggests far-right parties could increase their seats in the European Parliament from 80 to 122 next year. Prof Goodwin says: “The issue of the refugee crisis is massive for the EU. If they cannot be seen to respond effectively to that issue and they cannot come up with a unified plan, that is going to cause the EU major, major problems.” So what is the current situation? HUNGARY At the vanguard of the populist surge is PM Viktor Orban. In power since 2010, he has exploited unease over immigration to whip up nationalist sentiment. He casts himself as the defender of Europe against Muslim migrants, saying “a Europe with a mixed population” has “no sense of identity”.  Hungary is now described as an “illiberal democracy” due to its suppression of free speech and political cronyism. Allies of Orban, 55, have been appointed to key positions in the courts, media and civil service. In June, a law was introduced so that anyone “facilitating illegal immigration” could face prison. Another crackdown, a swipe at billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a fierce critic of Orban, aims to curtail the activities of charities and civil rights groups. Hungary has been referred to the European Court of Justice for “non-compliance” with EU law but Brussels has done little to tackle corruption in the country and allegations that billions of euros in EU funding goes to Orban’s cronies. GERMANY The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party entered parliament for the first time in last October’s elections, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. Preying on fears about immigration and Islam, one of its leading figures, Alexander Gauland, 77, has talked of fighting an “invasion of foreigners”. The party has also been accused of anti-Semitism.  Traditional Conservative parties have shifted to the right to head off the threat. Angela Merkel’s government almost collapsed this year when her coalition partners the Baian-based Christian Social Union demanded a tougher line on immigration. SWEDEN The Sweden Democrats, who are anti-immigration, are now polling a record high of 20 per cent. The party, which has roots in neo-Nazi organisations, is pushing an agenda of “Swexit”, halting migration and outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to beyond Europe’s borders. Its focus on crime and immigration has found appeal among voters who previously supported the centre-left Social Democrats. It could hold the balance of power after next month’s election. POLAND The right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015 and promotes a hardline nationalist and religious agenda. The Government has alarmed the EU by taking control of state media and granting itself powers to hire and fire the previously independent judiciary.  Exploiting unease about immigration, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 69, claimed that migrants could  cause “epidemics”.    The Government made it illegal to accuse the Polish state of complicity in the Holocaust, leading to accusations  that it is trying to cover  up collaboration with  the Nazis.  AUSTRIA The anti-immigration Freedom Party was given several key cabinet posts as part of a coalition deal with the majority People’s Party. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party wants a tough line on asylum seekers and immigrants. Legislation before the Austrian parliament would force asylum seekers to hand over their mobile phones and surrender cash to pay for their upkeep. Other proposals include a ban on girls aged 10 and under from wearing headscarves at school. A leading party member caused controversy by demanding a law requiring permits for kosher meat. The Government had to reassure the Jewish community the suggestion was not official policy. BRITAIN There are fears that a failure to deliver the Brexit promised by the Leave campaign could fuel far-right tensions here. UKIP has made a mini-recovery in the polls off the back of its claim that PM Theresa May is “betraying” voters with her soft Brexit. Leader Gerard Batten has taken the party further to the right with anti-Muslim \u0026shyrhetoric, calling Islam a “death cult” and talking of an “explosion” of mosques in Europe.

They have written to Labour\u0027s general secretary outlining steps for the party to move forward in the anti-Semitism row. The Board of Deputies of British Jews  said the Labour leader had to acknowledge his own failings and offer a heartfelt apology for some of his past actions. The group also called for the party to finally adopt the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance  working definition of anti-Semitism in full and resolve outstanding disciplinary cases of anti-Semitism. The BDBJ\u0027s chief executive, Gillian Merron, wrote to Labour general secretary Jennie Formby on Wednesday. In the letter she referred to a number of recent reports which detailed past events where Mr Corbyn had shared a platform with individuals who had expressed anti-Semitic views.  She also cited comments he made in 2013 where he had criticised Zionists for having no sense of English irony. This is a classic racist trope, Ms Merron said. To move forward, Mr Corbyn must acknowledge his own failings and offer a heartfelt apology to British Jews and to the Israeli victims of the terrorists with whom he has shown solidarity. The BDBJ\u0027s intervention comes after Mr Corbyn\u0027s comments on Zionists were condemned by a former chief rabbi. Lord Sacks said the comments gave support to racists, terrorists, and dealers of hate. The crossbench peer compared the comments to Enoch Powell\u0027s inflammatory rivers of blood speech, although Labour hit back at the criticism, branding it absurd and offensive. On Wednesday, the Prime Minister called on Mr Corbyn to address Lord Sacks\u0027 criticism.  During a tour of Africa, Theresa May said: Anti-Semitism is racism. We should all condemn racism in all its forms.  Lord Sacks was a long-standing chief rabbi, he raised significant concerns but it\u0027s not just him - members of the Labour Party have raised concerns as well.   I think the leader of the Labour Party needs to respond to those concerns. In the footage from 2013, Mr Corbyn said of the Zionists: They clearly have two problems. One is they don\u0027t want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all of their lives, they don\u0027t understand English irony either.  A Labour Party spokesperson said:  Jeremy Corbyn described a particular group of pro-Israel activists as Zionists, in the accurate political sense, not as a synonym or code for Jewish people.  Jeremy Corbyn is determined to tackle anti-Semitism both within the Labour Party and in wider society and the Labour Party is committed to rebuilding trust with the Jewish community.  Labour\u0027s National Executive Committee is expected to consider its code of conduct on anti-Semitism when the ruling body meets next week.

Housing bosses say at least 55,775 new homes need to be built a year in the north to meet demand. But the Government is planning to build only 42,435 houses a year in the region, an analysis has found. Homes for the North, a consortium of 18 housing associations, says this is 13,000 fewer homes than needed and will mean 16,000 fewer construction jobs and a \u0026pound2.37billion loss in economic output. The organisation says 500,000 new homes need to be built in the north over the next ten years. An analysis for Homes for the North by planning consultants Lichfield found the Government’s formula for calculating the number of homes needed in 72 councils in the north was based on “flawed” statistics. It says the figures were drawn up during “a period of sluggish economic growth” and do not accurately reflect the true demand.  Critics said the government’s target also undermined its pledge to build a Northern Powerhouse. Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey MP said: “Ministers’ flawed housing targets are a cap on northern aspiration. “Ambitious northern areas want to build for the future, but changes set to be made by ministers will make it harder for them to do that. “The housing crisis is a national crisis. Home-ownership has fallen in every region since 2010, and there is visibly rising homelessness in almost every town and city in the country. “The Chancellor should use the next Budget to reverse the deep cuts in housing investment made since 2010 and back northern areas to build.” "},{"url":null,"title":"safety motorway bridges england reviewed","story":"NewsSafety of motorway bridges in England reviewed in wake of Genoa tragedy which killed 43 peopleJim O’Sullivan said the review would take a number of months, but he was confident that a bridge collapse could never happen in EnglandShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent18:12, 29 AUG 2018NewsForty-three people were killed when a 200 metre section of the Morandi motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city earlier in August \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMotorway bridges in England are reviewed in wake of the collapse of a bridge in Genoa which killed 43 people, the head of Highways England has revealed. Jim O’Sullivan said the review would take a number of months, but he was confident that a bridge collapse could never happen in England.  Forty-three people were killed when a 200 metre section of the Morandi motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city earlier in August.    He told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Anna Foster, that there were no bridges with the same design on our motorways and that the Mr O\u0027Sullivan explained how the review would be carried out.  He said: “If we were complacent we might not, but we are doing a review, so we’re looking at some of our structures but only as a precautionary measure –we have nothing that tells us that we might have a bridge that’s in anyway in trouble like that.  For the biggest structures we’re looking at them one by one, but we have many bridges, we have over twenty thousand structures in one way shape or form on this road network and many of them are all to the same design, so we’re looking at the design and we’re looking across them as groups as well. Asked how long the full review would take, Mr O’Sullivan said: “we’re probably going to spend about three months on it and then thereafter if there are lessons to learn, typically in an engineering environment you might spend twelve to eighteen months changing your programmes.  Asked if Genoa could ever happen here, Mr O’Sullivan said: “No, straightforward answer. The first thing is we don’t have any bridges of a similar design.  He added: Our maintenance regime here in the UK is very, very good and many of the people who work in Highways England in our supply chain are seen as world leaders in the maintenance of bridges so we’re very confident of what we do.

Judith Kilshaw and her ex-husband Alan tried to adopt the children from their American mum after handing over \u0026pound8,200. But after British social services stepped in, the babies were returned to the US, where they have since been brought up by a loving church-going family. On Wednesday the Mirror told how Kiara and Keyara Wecker, now 18, are now starting their adult lives and studying social sciences. It was the first time Judith, 64, had heard anything about the life of the babies she had cradled all those years ago.  And in her terraced home in north Wales, she said:“I’m pleased they are doing well. That is all I have ever really wanted, for them to have a stable life, to have a good life.” But she insisted she should have been allowed to bring the girls up as her own. “I think they should have stayed with me and Alan” she said. Judith still has faded photographs of the girls from their brief time in the UK. And she admits she looks at them every now and then and wonders what might have been. “They are 18? That has gone quick. I wonder what they look like?” she said. “I wonder how they feel, the girls, I wonder if they have been told the truth of what happened. I do wonder if they know about me and Alan.  “I’m glad they have gone to university. I’m glad they are going to prosper and haven’t got pregnant at 16 or gone off the rails. “I hope they do very well, I wish them all the best.” Judith and Alan split in 2006 and three years later she married Stephen Sillett, now 51. But she remains on good terms with her ex and he even walked her down the aisle at her wedding. Alan, 63, a former a solicitor, suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and has been in hospital for the past seven months. Judith plans to care for him when he is allowed to return to his home in Shotton, north Wales. She and Stephen still live together in Rhosllanerchrugog, but when asked if they are a couple she said: “Not really, in a sense yes and in a sense no. It is a bit of a muddle.” Judith says she and Alan, who have two sons, James, 25 and Rupert, 22, often speak about the twin girls they had hoped to raise.  “It’s a shame that they aren’t going to university around here, I wished they had stayed in Britain, we have very good universities in Britain. “I would have wanted them to have made something of their life - be professional, get a good education, make good life choices.” The mum of four, who has five cats and a dog and also looks after her ex’s five cats, said: “I wanted them to go into law or the medical field, or even the veterinary field. That would have been handy, with having all these animals. “Sometimes I think about them, wonder where they are, how their life is going because it could’ve gone very wrong, they could have ended up getting involved in the gang and gun culture, I would have blamed social services if that had happened.” Judith has two daughters from an earlier relationship, Louisa, 37 and Caley, 35, but has no contact with either of them. “Caley is in Seattle, we don’t speak, we have no spoken for a long long time. And Louisa is in Edinburgh, and I don’t speak to her either.”  But she said she would love to speak to the twins Kiara and Keyara. Asked what she would say to them she said: “Look at you now, haven’t you done well. I wish you could’ve stayed but I’m glad you’ve made something of your lives.” She added: “I would like to see them again, would like to talk to them on video chat, to see how they are and how they’ve turned out. It would be nice to hear from them and explain who I am and let them know they were wanted. “Sometimes Alan and I talk about them, at times like Christmas especially, we’ve often wondered what they are doing now.” The twins were just six months old when they were caught in the centre of a transatlantic custody battle. Judith and Alan, unable to have more children of their own, had explored international adoption opportunties on the internet and travelled to the US to meet the young babies they hoped to raise as their own. It later emerged another couple in America couple had previously adopted the sisters, who were then snatched back by their birth mother Tranda Wecker, 28, and sold on to the Kilshaws for \u0026pound8,200.

For the last seven years, Kate has stuck to her iconic classy and sophisticated look, while Meghan has definitely brought a bit of Hollywood glamour into the royal family. But despite their differences, both women love colour and have been photographed wearing pretty much every colour when out and about at official events. Well, every colour except one.   According to the Express , there is one colour they both avoid - orange.  But don\u0027t worry, they\u0027re not banned from wearing orange because of some weird historical royal protocol - and the reason they don\u0027t wear it is far more practical. It simply doesn\u0027t photograph well.  Meghan avoided the colour when she was on the red carpet in her former life as a successful actress, which suggests she was well aware of this rule in the celebrity world.

Nicola Urquhart says a lack of CCTV in the hours after her son vanished means he could have walked or been driven out of the area he was last seen in. She claims new information has come to light in the case of the 23-year-old, who vanished after a night out with pals in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk.  Detectives investigating Corrie\u0027s disappearance in September 2016 believe he climbed into a bin and was transported to a waste site around 30 miles away.   Specialist search teams spent 27 weeks scouring the landfill near Cambridge last year, but found no trace of the airman\u0027s remains. Last night, Nicola, 49, posted a lengthy and emotional statement on the \u0027Find Corrie\u0027 Facebook group, saying she was simply a mum looking for her son. She listed a series of facts, as we understand them and claimed they show without reasonable doubt that Corrie was never in a bin or in landfill. She also alleged her son could have left the \u0027Horseshoe\u0027 area without being captured on CCTV - something she initially thought wasn\u0027t possible.  She claimed: Initially I was told by the RAF that no one would have been able to leave this area [Horseshoe] without being captured on this CCTV. The senior investigating officer  then confirmed this fact.  We have now been told that this is not accurate. Corrie could have left in a vehicle after 7am and could have walked out in any direction after midday. The reason for this is the CCTV was only collected in the immediate area up to midday. After 7am not one of the huge number of vehicles in the area have been identified or traced, this is why he could leave in any of these vehicles and there was no CCTV collected in this area after noon – this is why Corrie could have walked out. Following Corrie\u0027s disappearance, it was initially thought the airman, who was based at RAF Honington, may have tried to go home. A search from Bury St Edmunds to RAF Honington was carried out, but Nicola said she believes other areas need searching.  She said: “We know that when Corrie went missing there was a massive search carried out from Bury to Honington this search covered the area that if a person was to walk the police have guessed – slightly more to it than a simple guess, I am using simple terms – which would be most likely. “Suffolk MIT have drawn a line of the most direct way to walk “as the crow flies”. This area has been searched. “However, when I have been with Corrie, including the week before he disappeared he drove from Honington to Bury on each occasion by driving along the A134 and along Green Ln. “April [his partner] has also confirmed this is the way Corrie would usually drive. “The search for Corrie walking back to Honington only covers the right-hand side fields of this road with only the verge on the other side being searched. She claimed: There have been a couple of other areas searched on this side but the majority has not been searched passed the standard search when searching a road.”  The \u0026pound2million hunt for Corrie was shelved earlier this year after police said there were no realistic lines of enquiry left to pursue.  Officers from Suffolk Constabulary said the young man\u0027s case would remain open and be moved to the Major Investigation Cold Case Team.  Any credible new information will continue to be followed up by cops - however it may never be known what happened to Corrie. In her post, Nicola added: The entire area that had rubbish dumped on it from September 19 when Cell 22 was opened to September 30 when it was closed was searched and rubbish from Bury on the dates that Corrie went missing was found but not one single trace of Corrie or his clothes was found. “Rubbish was found in Cell 22 from the exact date Corrie went missing and could be confirmed it was from Bury. I believe this all shows without reasonable doubt that Corrie was never in this bin or landfill.” The mum also said she would be looking to have areas searched but this will take time, should I need help again with searching I will ask.

Despite her protestations he bombarded her with calls and texts, left balloons and flowers on her car, and waited for her to finish work at a hairdresser’s in Russell Road, Rhyl . Mr Neary said that to escape from him she went to stray with her sister in Kinmel Bay, but Edwards-Hughes was spotted driving up and down outside the house. On July 9 the defendant’s mother contacted Miss Cox to apologise for his behaviour and said he had never been happier than when he was with her – but Mr Neary told the court that she had done the same thing in relation to his previous victims. In one call Edwards-Hughes, an HGV driver, of Liddell Drive, Llandudno, suggested he would kill himself, and told Miss Cox: “Tell Mum and Dad I love them” – just as he had told previous victims. In an impact statement Miss Cox, who had met him secretly on occasions because she knew that her family hated him, said: “His behaviour has become unbearable.” "},{"url":null,"title":"hero doctor saves deliveroo cyclists","story":"NewsHero doctor saves Deliveroo cyclist\u0027s life by getting crowd to push van wheel off neckSouthmead anesthetist Vinay Pandya sprang into action to save the man\u0027s life outside the Wills Memorial BuildingShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByTristan Cork05:53, 30 AUG 2018Newsthis.style.display=\u0027none\u0027\"/Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror/news/uk-news/video/footage-shows-scene-hero-doctor-13161523,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-M3TH25P,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:false,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx/rhs,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA doctor has told how he saved a cyclist’s life after finding him trapped under a van with the back wheel crushing his neck and within seconds of death. Vinay Pandya shouted at a gathering crowd to gently push the van backwards, up the hill and off the man’s neck - and said if they had not, he would have died within a minute.  The cyclist, a Deliveroo rider, had ended up completely trapped underneath the rental van in a collision described by eye-witnesses as ‘horrific’, Bristol Live reports.  And Mr Pandya, who worked for years as a top anesthetist at Southmead, the BRI and Weston General Hospital, said he was ‘lucky to be alive’ after the crash in the centre of Bristol on Wednesday afternoon.  Mr Pandya’s told Bristol Live he had to shout and swear at the passers-by who came to help - as there was no time to lose. He said he was getting a coffee in the Clifton Triangle branch of Pret a Manger when he heard ‘terrible screaming’. “I thought instantly that this was not right, it wasn’t like the screaming you might hear with a hen party or something, my first thought was that this was some kind of terrorist attack,” he said. Mr Pandya rushed from the shop and saw a van coming to a stop outside the Wills Memorial Building, with people rushing to it. “I ran around the van and all I could see was a head sticking out from underneath,” he said.  “The van was completely covering him, and his body was diagonally underneath with the back wheel next to his head. He neck was right in front of the back wheel. “I told the crowd to let me through as I am a doctor, and got to him. I checked for a pulse and he did have one, but he was unconscious and not breathing with eyes half open and rolled back. “I instantly realised that the tyre was squeezing down on his neck, that this was what was crushing his neck and stopping him from breathing. I knew that the wheel had to come off his neck right away,” he added. Mr Pandya shouted to the crowd to push the van off him, but another man urged caution.  “A well-meaning crowd member shouted that we shouldn’t do anything until an ambulance arrived,” said Mr Pandya. “I shouted ‘I’m a doctor and I’m telling you to f***ing move the van back!’ Another man in the crowd got everyone organised really quickly, and I think someone must’ve gone in and released the handbrake. “It was no mean feat, because they pushed it gently uphill just seven or eight inches, and it was enough to get the wheel away from his neck,” he said. “I didn’t know too much about how many people did that, or how, because I was down there with him, holding his head, but it worked. “As soon as the pressure on his neck was eased, he began to breathe and I breathed a huge sigh of relief. Then he regained consciousness. He was able to tell me his name, and he had lots of injuries to his head and face. “Then the paramedics arrived and I was able to hand over to them. He was still stuck fast - I think the saddle of his bike was wedged under him and the van was completely on top of him,” he added.

Ministers today launched a 12-week consultation on scrapping sales of the controversial beverages to most teenagers in a bid to tackle the childhood obesity crisis. The move paves the way for an age restriction similar to that on cigarettes and alcohol, and the study will investigate support for outlawing sales to under-16s and under-18s. It comes after the Can It! campaign waged by TV chef Jamie Oliver and backed by this newspaper. Welcoming the plan, Jamie said last night: “We have a massive problem with kids and energy drinks. “Too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast. Teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted in classrooms because of these drinks, packed with stimulants. “The energy drinks industry has never thought these products were suitable for children.  They even say ‘not for children’ on the labels! The sale to kids should be stopped as soon as possible. “It’s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids. “I’m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the government this is the right thing to do.”  Announcing the plan during her three-day trip to Africa, Theresa May said in Nigeria: “Childhood obesity is one of the greatest health challenges this country faces, and that’s why we are taking significant action to reduce the amounts of sugar consumed by young people and to help families make healthier choices. “Our plans to tackle obesity are already world-leading, but we recognise much more needs to be done and as part of our long-term plan for the NHS, we are putting a renewed focus on the prevention of ill-health. “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children. “It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”  The consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. It would cover popular products like Red Bull and Monster, which are packed with caffeine. One 250ml can of energy drink typically contains around 80mg of caffeine – the equivalent of nearly three cans of cola. Some energy drinks also contain exceptionally high levels of sugar. On average, they have 60% more calories and 65% more sugar than other regular soft drinks. Experts blame them for fuelling obesity and tooth decay among kids, with more than two thirds of 10-17-year-olds and a quarter of six-to-nine-year-olds guzzling energy drinks. Potential punishments for shops which sell them to underage youngsters would be thrashed out later. But officials expect local Trading Standards inspectors would enforce the restrictions, possibly using sting operations. Sources pointed out businesses already operate age restriction policies for other products, such as alcohol, cigarettes, fireworks and scratch cards.  They believed age restrictions on sales of energy drinks should not cause “practical problems” for retailers. Health officials welcomed the consultation on a ban, which would apply to England. Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie said: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar. “Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.” Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health President, Professor Russell Viner, said: “There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people.  “It’s therefore worrying that so many young people are buying these drinks at low prices and consuming them on a regular basis. “The growing market for energy drinks and potential for harm to children and young people clearly warrants further scrutiny. “That’s why we’re pleased to see Government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children’s health.” Under the Government\u0027s Childhood Obesity Plan, ministers will also consult on introducing calorie labelling on menus in restaurants, caf\u0026eacutes and takeaways curbing TV and online advertising restrictions on foods high in fat, salt and sugar and restricting in-store promotions on unhealthy products.

Dolly Vemon claims she found faeces - that she believes to be human - a dead seagull and rubbish littering the appalling\u0027 resort. The 28-year-old had visited the Camber Sands holiday resort in East Sussex for a bank holiday break with her husband, five-year-old daughter and two friends with newborn babies. But the horrified mum said she feared for the safety of the children after claiming they were met with atrocious and filthy conditions and rude staff.  The cosmetics tattooing business owner told : The photos do not even really show how filthy it was. When we got there I was bleaching everything in our room. There was faeces everywhere which I now now think is human as I\u0027ve been told there no dogs allowed there. I spent most of the time crying. I could not believe it. It just got worse and worse. The staff didn\u0027t care. They were getting a backlash from everyone, everyone was complaining. Dolly said they paid over \u0026pound200 for the three day trip but were forced to leave early thanks to the horrendous state of the resort. Dolly\u0027s claims include:  A swimming pool so dirty you couldn\u0027t see the bottom Stacks of rotting food piled up over hours in the breakfast area Staff without hairnets and one staff member working in a kitchen with his hairy belly exposed A dead seagull left on a pathway Broken glass and rubbish across the site Dirty plates and piles of sand left in their hotel room Faeces in common areas Neglectful and rude staff, including one who swore in front of children Witnessing a fight between two families at a children\u0027s disco   The series of shocking events meant the group stayed for just two days but spent the whole time fearing for the health and safety of their kids. Dolly, who comes from Bognor Regis, said: We didn\u0027t leave our accommodation on the Friday evening because it was just attrocious. Saturday we took our daughter who is five to the bouncy castle. After we arrived a poo came out of a baby\u0027s nappy. The parent of the baby didn\u0027t even had a chance to offer to clean it up before a staff member came over, handed her a bottle of water and said \u0027you are used to cleaning up its s***\u0027. I was appalled at the language and appalled she was expected to clean it up with just water. Dolly said her husband is a Royal Marine who is only home six days a month due to work, meaning the break was even more important to them. But the incidents kept piling up.

It might have only been two words but Harry was applauded wildly by the cast as he began a speech with a joke after a special charity performance of the show. During the hit hip-hop musical, currently showing in Victoria, London, character King George III sings \u0027You\u0027ll be Back\u0027. And Harry, who had just watched the performance, sang the opening two words to the song \u0027You say\u0027 to huge applause.

Ahead of the show, Miranda said it would be fun and surreal to see Harry and Meghan watch the extravagant, pompous king character during the biography of US founding father Alexander Hamilton. Miranda said: Smash cut to 2018 I\u0027m sitting next to his sixth-great grandson. Ladies and gentlemen, the Duke of Sussex. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex attended the gala performance put on in support of Harry’s charity Sentebale.  They were welcomed by the Lin-Manuel Miranda and his wife Vanessa before the group took their seats in the theatre\u0027s Royal Circle. But after the public had left they went onstage to share their appreciation for the performance with the cast, including the man who played the king.  Meghan told actors the energy on the night was palpable, adding: It was so engaging, every moment of it. Harry said: That was absolutely incredible.

The respected Russian photographer came from a well-to-do family who were members of the Russian nobility in the nineteenth century. He grew up in the latter half of the 1800s and enjoyed a comfortable upbringing and enviable education as a chemist and musician. But it was his ground-breaking and pioneering work in colour photography in the early part of twentieth century Russia that made his name.  He went on to make 2,607 distinct images of Russia making him one of the most prolific photographers of his time. Here is what you need to know about the prolific photographer. Who was Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky? Prokudin-Gorsky was born in Funikova Gora, a state in the west of nineteenth-century Russia, to noble parents on August 30, 1863. The family moved to Saint Petersburg where Prokudin-Gorsky went to Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology to study chemistry and the Imperial Academy of Arts to study music and painting. By 1901 he had opened his own photography studio and laboratory in Saint Petersburg. From there began an obsession with photographic techniques and the chemistry behind developing photos. He travelled to Berlin and studied photochemistry with professor Adolf Miethe - the most advanced practitioner in Germany at that time. His work began in earnest around this time and between 1905 and 1915 he traveled the length and breadth of pre-revolution Russia which at that time took up one-sixth of the planet\u0027s land mass. He documented all the life he found there creating thousands of images and his work won him applause from the toast of Russian society, and later fame across the world. The photos show the lives of the ordinary people who lived in Russia as well as architecture, cities, agriculture infrastructure and public works of the time - all in brilliant colour thanks to his skill in chemistry.  What was Sergey Prokudin-Gorsky famous for? His best-known work during his lifetime was a colour portrait of War and Peace author Leo Tolstoy which was reproduced in magazines and on postcards due to its popularity. His incredible effort to document this revolutionary time had only started a few years before when he was invited to show his work to the Russian Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich and Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna in 1908, and to Tsar Nicholas II and his family in 1909. He impressed the Tsar so much he got the Tsar\u0027s patronage and financial blessing to continue his work. But his greatest contributions to photography were in his work with photochemistry and colour techniques. His research resulted in the creation of patents for colour film slides and projecting colour motion images. He used this specially honed techniques in his work, traveling around Russia in a specially equipped train carriage turned darkroom given to him by the Tsar .

Anesthesiologist Andi Traynor, 45, was on her first official date with Max Montgomery, 56, when he collapsed on the beach after a morning of surfing. Max, a tech content creator, had felt a burning sensation in his chest while paddling but didn\u0027t realise anything was wrong until he began to feel exhausted after he left the water. Andi, of Palo Alto, California, was shocked as she watched Max collapse on Capitola Beach, Santa Cruz, and couldn’t find her new flame’s pulse when she turned him over.  The mum-of-two immediately began to perform CPR on Max, of Santa Cruz, California, with the help of passersby. Within seven minutes, an ambulance had arrived and stretchered Max off the beach before reviving him using a defibrillator on route to Dominican Hospital.

Andi said: Two days before our first date, Max told me he had a crush on me and I was really interested. We had been friends for a little while and I was really interested in spending some more time together. “He suggested we get up really early that Saturday and go surfing. We had such a wonderful time. “We got out of the water and he was carrying the boards and all of a sudden he fell. It was so weird. I immediately ran over to him and turned him over.  He wasn’t responding and he didn’t have a pulse. “I started CPR and I called for help. We were very lucky that one of the people who stopped was a nurse. The ambulance got there so quick and those guys are amazing. “We hadn’t revived him and they gave him three shocks on the beach which didn’t work and medicine that didn’t work. “When they took him away in the ambulance, I didn’t know if he was going to live.” Max added: “It was surreal.

Instructor Christina Spirig, 31, from Luzern, Switzerland, has been training in pole dance for eight years and she wasn\u0027t going to give up when she fell pregnant. Christina had been warned by her family about carrying on with her routines while pregnant - and she even admits she knows it\u0027s dangerous if you fall from the pole or if you crash into it with your belly. However, Christina explained that going into labour so close to her contractions was safe because the motion of her pole dancing would always send her baby to sleep. Christina, owner of Poledance Luzern, welcomed her second child in June 2018, after she already had an eight-year-old son.  It was only after welcoming her first son that Christina found her love for pole dance when she wanted to find a sport that she had a real passion for. After having done gymnastics for years when she was young, Christina saw a picture of a friend on a pole and decided she wanted to give it a go. “I have been doing pole dancing since 2010, after the birth of my son when I wanted to find a sport like gymnastics that I could be really passionate about,” said Christina. “When I saw a picture of a friend on a pole that’s where the journey began.  “Pole dance can give you so many physical and mental benefits. “You can get fit, muscular, flexible and balanced while doing it. It’s the combination of strength, flexibility, art and dance that make it such a forever passion. “Pole dancing has so many tricks, combinations and shapes you can do so that gives you constant motivation to continue with training. “You can also achieve a lot of things already in the first weeks which makes you happy, confident and motivated to carry on. “From the beginning of my fifth month of pregnancy, when my belly really started to grow, I eliminated every trick that touched the pole with the belly and all the drops and flips.  It’s important to make a smooth landing and to avoid hitting anything. “It can be dangerous if you fall from the pole or if you crash into it with your belly. I also was inverting with more speed than just the strength it takes so that my abs could separate healthily – to give the uterus enough space. “It’s important to have a good body balance and to know what your body is capable of. The longer you’ve already done pole dancing for before you get pregnant, the better. “I think pole dancing made my recovery from birth much easier because I practiced deep core activations which helped me to recover from my difficult labour.”  Christina trained between three to five times a week until she reached six months of her pregnancy, although she adapted her routines for the safety of herself and the baby throughout her full pregnancy. For the final two months of her pregnancy Christina trained just once a week for 45 minutes. “At times it was hard to mentally accept that my body was changing and to be happy with everything that works and what doesn’t work while being heavily pregnant,” Christina said. “I listened to my body, and if it felt bad, weird or insecure then I wouldn’t do something. In my own opinion, it’s good to stay in the same level throughout your pregnancy or even to take a lower level class rather than try new things. “It’s important to have the know-how of a professional dancer at hand and the level of practice involved to carry on while pregnant.

The incident took place on the beach of Fontanilla, in Conil de la Frontera, in the southern Spanish province of Cadiz in the region of Andalusia. The footage shows the boat approaching the shore of a beach, where people can be seen lying on their towels and sunbathing. As soon as the nose of the boat wedges into the sand everybody inside quickly jumps off into the water and runs across the sand. The migrants, seemingly mostly young men, try to make it off the sands before they can be caught by authorities.  But still some of them even wave to the beach-goers, who wish them luck and offer them water. According to local media, Spanish authorities detained the immigrants soon afterwards near the beach and in surrounding areas. Roughly 13 of those caught are said to be minors. This incident comes just one day after another boat carrying 44 immigrants got stuck near the coast in the same municipality and were unable to reach land.  The boat was rescued by Spanish authorities, who escorted them to a safe place. The video of the rescue shows the black boat being accompanied by the Spanish Civil Guard only few metres from the shore. Local media report that at least 500 migrants have landed on the Andalusian coast on 18 different boats since Friday. In July about 50 migrants were filmed landing on a packed beach and sprinting up the sand at a beach in Zahora, a 20 minute drive from Fontanilla.

Instead, residents would have special permits allowing them to drive through.Police have already said it would be unlikely the required number of officers would be available to enforce permits each day.Ron Neave, chairman of Fintry Community Council, met council officer John Berry this week to discuss the issue.Mr Neave believes that a one-way system would be effective in defusing the ongoing traffic issues.“A one-way system is still worth a trial – the road is effectively already a one-way street because it is lined with parked cars,” he said.“I was told that making a street one-way would encourage speeding – but if we put in a 20mph limit and police carried out unplanned, ad hoc enforcement it might be enough to deter people.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b852201f1ad5.jpg ","title":"csaba believes his new dundee united players now know they have best fans in championship","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes his new Dundee United players now know they have the best fans in the Championship – if they give them something to shout about.Having been booed after earlier poor results at home, Saturday saw the Tangerines given a standing ovation at the end of their 3-1 win over Partick Thistle.And Csaba feels that’s sent a clear message to his team.“We have had a lot of criticism until now but the team needed a little time because we changed a lot of players, with 19 out and 15 new coming in,” he said.“There was a lot of disappointment in the summer and against Dunfermline in the first league game we were OK first half, but not in the second.“Queen of the South was OK and I think this performance, we looked like a team and I am pleased with this.“The players who come in now feel the Dundee United fans are very critical but on the other side are very thankful if you fight for them, fight for the club and show commitment.“Do that and they are really thankful. Of course, it is not so you can win every game but if you play like we did on Saturday, with this will and commitment to the club, the fans will show they are happy.“It must always be the same as it was against Partick Thistle and now we have to develop this.”Csaba’s also of the opinion his players are now beginning to reap the benefits of the graft they’ve been doing since pre-season kicked off near the end of June.“We have worked hard on set-pieces and also in the counter-attack. It’s clear, too, we have some fast players, attacking players like Craig Curran, Pavol Safranko and Yannick Loemba, who are direct.“This can give us chances in the front.“In the future I want a little bit more movement without the ball than we had in the game against Partick.“If you don’t have that movement you can make the game more difficult but if you have players like Curran and Safranko up front you can create problems for the opponents.”Meanwhile, winger Billy King has stepped up his training after being out since the start of pre-season with a thigh problem.It’s likely to be a few more week before he returns.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csabas ability to stay clam bodes well for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLet’s be honest, most football people are not known for their extensive reading.Other than a glance at the back pages to see what’s been written about them, those in the game don’t tend to stray too far into the world of books.And even if Csaba Laszlo does, as an ethnic Hungarian born and brought up in Romania, it’s unlikely a book of Rudyard Kipling’s poetry is the first thing he reaches for when he fancies a good read.But if he ever did glance over the first few lines of Kipling’s “If”, he might feel it could have been written with him in mind.It’s the one that starts – “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. . .”We’ll stop there because, to be honest, classic work that it is, it does drone on for a bit.And those opening lines do, pretty much, show the ability demonstrated by the Dundee United gaffer over the opening weeks of the season.As his new team struggled to get going during a difficult Betfred Cup group campaign, Csaba was as disappointed as anyone.But he remained calm, didn’t panic and showed an understanding of the criticism that came his way from a support he knows is as desperate as he is to see the Tangerines back where they feel they belong.Most important of all, he stayed firm in his belief the changes he’s been at the centre of over the last few months were both necessary and the right ones.And while that process still has a long way to go before it’s been successfully completed, after two big Championship wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle, now there are at least concrete signs United are heading in the right direction.The success in Dumfries just over a fortnight ago brought a first three vital league points and with them a needed boost to morale.After the toils in the Betfred Cup were followed by a hugely- disappointing home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline, that something was done to lift spirits was vitally important.Having done that, last Saturday saw United seize the opportunity to send a message to the rest of their division that they can live up to their pre-season billing as one of the promotion favourites.The 3-1 win over Partick Thistle, another side expected to challenge near the top, was as convincing as could be hoped for from a side that remains in the middle of the rebuilding process.From the moment defender Paul Watson headed the first of his two goals inside the first 10 minutes, they were in control.It did take them longer than they would have liked to seal the win via Watson’s second fine header in the 78th minute but by the end Craig Curran had added a third.Over the 90 minutes they bossed the proceedings and looked every inch serious promotion contenders.As well as having some exciting attacking talent like Fraser Aird, Yannick Loemba, Craig Curran and Pavol Safranko, the team as a whole turned in a strong display.Almost as importantly, and whether conscious or not of those words written over a century before, the manager kept his head. As was the case when he didn’t panic when things were not going so well a few weeks earlier, he was not going to get carried away by this performance.He knows there is a long way to go in this most difficult of leagues and as he poetically puts it himself, there will be more stones along this rocky road.But he will stay calm and focused and, for United fans, that has to be encouraging.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b86638d2685b-376x564.jpg ","title":"dundee council to build social let homes in place of eyesore

new homes will be built at Murrayfield Drive and Murrayfield Terrace, close to the former Longhaugh Quarry.They will be constructed on the site of former blocks of flats, which are being demolished and were previously deemed “eyesores” by locals.Mr Low said a planning application for the “high-quality” houses and flats is likely to be submitted sometime next month.He added: “We’re looking at building 35 or 36 new houses in those two streets and we’re hoping we will be on site in the spring.“It’ll be high-quality materials for a high-quality development in Whitfield.”He promised a iety of homes to suit all sizes of household – and, as with several new developments in the city, there will be some supported accommodation run in association with Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership.The homes will be constructed to modern energy efficiency standards so they are cheap to heat and keep warm – ideal for social tenants.Mr Low added: “We will have a whole range of sizes, starting from one-bedroom flats and two, three and four-bedroom houses.“We’re also looking at supported accommodation, working with the health and social care partnership.“They will be the first in-house developed homes in Dundee for quite some time – until now we’ve always been in partnership with a housing association, such as Hillcrest.”A site investigation to assess the land is still ongoing and must be completed before the planning application can be submitted.North East Labour councillor Brian Gordon said it was “pretty exciting”that new social housing was to be built in Whitfield.He asked about the possibility of existing social tenants in the area being prioritised for the new homes as many have lived in their council properties for years.However, Mr Low said that it was unlikely as residents had not been displaced as a result of the new flats.Mr Gordon added: “These people feel they will never get out of there, and they’ve seen such nice regeneration going on

The Scottish Government later won an appeal against the decision.The current plan reduces the number of wind turbines by a third.A report on the project said: “Inch Cape will make an important contribution to Scotland’s renewable energy and climate change targets.“The expected annual CO2 emissions savings from Inch Cape could account for the equivalent of between eight and 21% of the total carbon emissions estimated for Scotland.”If approved, the new wind farm would create more than 1,000 full-time jobs during construction and up to 143 jobs after completion.It would also create up to £136 million in revenue for Scotland during construction and up to £18m per annum once in operation.Construction is expected to start around 2021, and will take approximately 24 months over three years.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b86636912c37-846x564.jpg ","title":"plan to put ancient headstone unearthed at dundee howff on display","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe future of an 800-year-old tombstone unearthed in the Howff in Dundee will soon be decided by conservationists.The “fascinating” headstone, which is believed to date from the 12th Century, was discovered by accident in April last year during a digital mapping exercise.Those involved in its conservation have been locked in discussions over its future but a plan has now been put in place which will see it put on full public display inside the cemetery.The tombstone will probably be housed in a glass case for viewing inside a gated mausoleum next to the Barrack Street entrance.The plan, still to be approved by Dundee City Council and Historic Environment Scotland, will see specialist lighting, as well as information boards, installed inside.Simon Goulding, chairman of the Dundee Howff Conservation Group, believes the stone will become an international visitor attraction in its own right.He said: “It will be very positive for the city to have this stone preserved and put on public display, not only for local people but also for those from further afield.”As well as having the stone assessed by experts, the total cost of putting it on display is expected to reach more than £50,000.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"split second decisions costing dundee dear says manager neil mccann","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“Split-second decisions” are costing Dundee dearly at the moment, according to Dark Blues boss Neil McCann.Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at St Johnstone made it three losses from three in the Premiership for the Dens men.All three were by a single goal with individual errors proving costly.On the opening day of the campaign, goalkeeper Jack Hamilton’s slip gave St Mirren all three points before Genseric Kusunga’s outstretched arm gifted Aberdeen a penalty and a 1-0 victory the following week.And then on Saturday, a combination of giving the ball away in midfield and Josh Meekings’ attempt to play offside set Tony Watt away to score.With the goals not coming at the other end, these mistakes are proving extra costly.Neil said: “It’s not the performances that are the problem but we seem to be getting punished for individual errors.“It’s the odd-goal again we’ve lost by on Saturday.“There was the goal at St Mirren, the handball against Aberdeen and then a poor decision defensively on Saturday.“It’s difficult, you just have to keep on working on things and make sure you are giving them information.“Ultimately it is split-second decisions the players make and they are either right ones or wrong ones.“We discussed some things in the half-time break about the area Watt likes to operate in.“He cheats and walks, he tries to live on the breakdown of the ball, trying to earn that yard and we coughed up the ball, made a poor decision defensively.“Watt got the run on us and finished it well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b86638f86b8d-846x564.jpg ","title":"traveller community in spotlight at dundee rep","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe story of Scottish Travellers living in 1930s Perthshire has opened a new season of ensemble plays at Dundee Rep.The Yellow on the Broom is an adaptation of Betsy Whyte’s 1979 autobiography, told through music and song.Written for the stage by Anne Downie, the play tells the story of young Traveller Bessie Townsley.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors.

If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

Its dual focus is to create highly engaging exhibitions and to provide a unique platform for arts education.Douglas became interested in the operation and upkeep of the vehicle itself and, as a performance artist, what acts of maintenance go into performing the narrative, social collaborations and technologies of the gallery.Using the literal mechanics of the bus to create a personalised birthday celebration, Douglas has created an entertaining exhibition which also explores bigger questions about the sustainability of the organisation.Claire Craig, curator of The Travelling Gallery said: ‘It has been hugely enjoyable, inspiring, and fitting to work with Gordon Douglas in Travelling Gallery’s 40th year.‘The exhibition continues Travelling Gallery’s excellent history of collaborating and commissioning new work by young Scottish artists, and Gordon has grabbed the opportunity with both hands and worked incredibly hard to produce work that on the surface is vibrant and playful but underneath is very intelligent and asks bigger questions about the future of our organisation.‘We can’t wait to take Black Box Take Stock on the road and celebrate our birthday with audiences across Scotland.’The Travelling Gallery will visit Lochgilphead schools on Wednesday August 29 and Thursday August 30, then will move on to Tarbert’s Templar Arts and Leisure Centre on Friday August 31 and Saturday September 1.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"celebrating befrienders with the easy club","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 28/08/18, 2:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA group set up to encourage folk to get together, relax and have fun is hosting a special celebration.The Easy Club, based in Lochgilphead, holds regular music evenings where the format is relaxed and informal.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.

The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.

The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.

Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.  The event is being held ahead of the submission of a series of applications, enacting the existing planning permission for the mixed-use development.  The site is located around Longniddry Farm, to the south of the vilage\u0026rsquos railway line, and follows the approval by East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee of 450 new homes at the site last August, with formal planning permission in principle issued in June.  The initial plans were approved despite concerns that the new development could split the village in two.  The development includes about 25 per cent affordable homes plus associated commercial and retail space, community facilities, infrastructure and green space.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

There had been initial concerns that the tie-up would affect these tariffs \u0026ndash\u0026nbspthe most common and expensive energy deals.  Anne Lambert, chairwoman of the inquiry group at the CMA, said: \u0026ldquoWith more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.  \u0026ldquoBut many people don\u0026rsquot shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard iable prices.  \u0026ldquoOur analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.          Read more about why we have provisionally cleared the proposed SSE / Npower merger: https:t.co/HilMPAUIMV pic.twitter/uqNYXjQ9h7          \u0026mdash Competition \u0026amp Markets Authority  August 30, 2018  The CMA had launched a full inquiry into the merger in May after its initial probe found the tie-up could reduce competition, potentially leading to higher prices for households.  Its in-depth probe looked at evidence from the Big Six suppliers, as well as smaller providers, customer groups and regulators.  It said this also included hearings with consumer groups and suppliers in Scotland, where SSE \u0026ndash formerly known as Scottish and Southern Energy \u0026ndash has a large share of consumers.  \u0026ldquoNone of these raised substantive concerns about the effects of the merger on householders, added the CMA.  The regulator\u0026rsquos fears were further eased by high levels of customer switching \u0026ndash the highest in a decade \u0026ndash while it also found the proportion on SVTs has fallen.  But it was the impact on those people who do not switch and are stuck on the so-called rip-off SVTs that most worried the CMA.  After looking into the effect on these households, it found if SVT customers switch, they would generally change to a cheaper fixed tariff.  And if people do switch, it would not tend to be between SSE and Npower, but instead another provider.  The CMA added that the incoming government-enforced price cap will also help protect customers on iable deals.  Npower and SSE announced in November that their British household energy supply and services businesses would join forces, reducing the Big Six energy suppliers to five.  Under the proposed deal, the new company will be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding 65.6% and Npower owner Innogy holding 34.4%.  SSE is Britain\u0026rsquos second biggest energy supplier and the merged group will serve around 11.5 million customers.  Centrica, Iberdrola , E.On and EDF make up the remainder of the Big\u0026nbspSix.  SSE boss\u0026nbspAlistair Phillips-Davies welcomed the CMA\u0026rsquos provisional findings.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe scale and pace of change in the Great Britain energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable.  \u0026ldquoThe planned transaction presents a great opportunity to create a more agile, innovative and efficient company that really delivers for customers and the energy market as a whole."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8485000.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"vodafone-seals-84bn-deal-to-merge-australian-business","story":"  The mobile phone giant said the tie-up of Vodafone Hutchison Australia and TPG Telecom will create a \u0026ldquomore powerful challenger to Telstra and Optus in Australia.

Of the 78 students due to begin studying dentistry there next month, 52 - 67% - are Scottish, down from 85% in 2012.  Over the same period, the share of overseas students among the intake has increased from 3% to 14%.  A similar pattern has also been seen at Scotland\u0027s other major undergraduate facility, Dundee Dental School, where the proportion of Scottish undergraduates among the first-year intake has reduced from a peak of 80% in 2012 to 63% in 2017 - although it has been as low as 40% at times, in 2010 and 2014.  The percentage of international students also went from 8% in 2012 14% in 2017, but peaked at 19% in 2015. Figures for 2018 were unavailable.  This mirrors the trend seen with medical school intakes, where the share of Scottish undergraduates studying to be doctors has fallen from 63% to 51% since 1999.  A spokesman for the British Dental Association  said: \"The Glasgow University figures show a worrying steady decline in the proportion of Scottish dental students in the past five years.  \"Scottish students are more likely to remain in Scotland and work in the NHS, therefore the University and the Scottish Government must ensure that Scottish applicants are not being disadvantaged compared with applicants from elsewhere in gaining a place to study dentistry at Glasgow.\"  Although dental students in receipt of a bursary are required to work in the NHS for one to five years after qualifying, depending on the amount of money they were given, most new dentists are free to leave Scotland as soon as their training is complete.  The number of places available to Scottish and non-UK EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government, based on projections of future workforce needs.  While Scottish and EU students do not pay tuition fees out of their own pocket, universities are reimbursed instead by the Scottish Government - at a current rate of \u0026pound1850 per year.  In comparison, Glasgow Dental School charges overseas students \u0026pound39,500 a year in tuition, adding up to a total bill of \u0026pound197,500 over the five-year degree.  At Dundee Dental School, an international student will pay even more - \u0026pound203,300 over the five years.  This has previously led to accusations that foreign students are used as \"cash cows\" to prop up university courses and sustain the Scottish Government\u0027s free tuition policy.  The actual number of international dental students at Glasgow has increased steadily over the past decade, from three to 11, while the total number of places has declined from 95 to 78.  At Dundee, the overseas intake climbed from fewer than five in 2007 to a peak of 24 in 2014, before declining back to eight in 2017.  Scottish Conservative shadow health secretary Miles Briggs said: \u0026ldquoThis is a similar situation to the declining number of Scots being accepted to study medicine.  \u0026ldquoBecause of SNP government policy, universities are being forced to take in more international students who pay fees for financial reasons.  \u0026ldquoThat means Scots are being squeezed out of their own universities.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos not only harmful to their aspirations, but the future of the NHS, for whom international students are less likely to stay on and work after graduating.  Labour Health spokesman Anas Sarwar, a former dentist, added: \"This is an example of how the SNP government bungle workforce planning for our health service.  \"Earlier this summer, Labour said that the SNP government should review the cap on student places with a view to raising it.\"  A spokesman for Dundee University said it was not true that Scottish students were \"squeezed out\" in favour of more lucrative foreign recruits.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe number of places on offer to Scottish and EU students is capped and funded by the Scottish Government on the basis of future workforce planning.  \"We are also permitted to recruit a limited number of international and rUK candidates but these places have no impact on the number of Scottish students studying Dentistry here.  A spokeswoman for Glasgow University said they could not comment as its Scottish and EU intakes were set by ministers.  Free tuition for EU students predates Brexit, when EU students were automatically entitled to live and work in Scotland. Around one in 10 of Scotland\u0027s dentists are from the EU and the BDA reported in April this year that UK dental practices are struggling to fill vacancies amid uncertainty over future visa rules.  The number of registered NHS dentists in Scotland dropped from 3670 to 3647 between 2016 and 2017, the first fall in five years and only the second year-on-year in 18 years.  A UK-wide BDA survey in 2017 also revealed that 58% of NHS dentists were considering leaving the profession within the next five years, and a third of members over the age of 55 were planning early retirement."},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  Salmond   s determination to clear his name could tear the SNP apart","story":"  The former First Minister is the most formidable fighter in politics and will not to go quietly into that good political night.

Mr Logan quoted advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  stating: \u0026ldquoSolar have advised us that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments, explaining that all children ... will participate.  However, a spokesman for Solar told The Herald the body did not provide a view to the Scottish Government on the literacy and numeracy assessments.  He said: \u0026ldquoSolar has not advised the Scottish Government that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments. Solar does not have an agreed position on this matter and has therefore not provided any formal or informal view.  \u0026ldquoTo clarify, Solar works alongside other stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, on a number of matters, but we cannot and do not provide any stakeholder with legal advice.  Last night, the Scottish Government said they had worked closely with Solar during the development of the assessments.    A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoHaving asked Solar for a view, we received a response and communicated that to directors of education in good faith.  The confusion over where the opt out advice had come from provoked a backlash from opposition politicians.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said it was \u0026ldquoutterly unacceptable for parents to have been misled and called for an apology.  He said: \u0026ldquoParents and teachers who were appalled when Mr Logan told them pupils could not opt out of these tests will be further shocked to discover the letter was based on an assertion which does not appear to be true.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said the government \u0026lsquos position on P1 testing was in \"utter confusion\".  She said: \"Worse still, it seems the Scottish Government has issued misinformation to the directors of education and has therefore confused matters even more. This is wholly unacceptable.\"  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Logan\u0027s letter to be withdrawn immediately.  He said: \"It is absolutely unacceptable behaviour by the government and yet another incident from blundering ministers intent on  making life difficult for parents.\"  There was also concerns from the members of a campaign set up to encourage parents in P1 to opt out of the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent organisation Connect, described the revelation as \"shocking\".  She said: \"It is very disturbing that this misinformation was used to support the government\u0026rsquos stance on standardised assessments.  \"Schools acting on this advice might find themselves in direct conflict with parents at what should be an exciting time for new P1 families.\"  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, said: \"Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the P1 tests, but thanks to this strange letter many headteachers are under the impression that this right doesn\u0026rsquot exist unless there are exceptional circumstances.\"  A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said the episode was \"very concerning\" and confusing for parents and teachers.  She said: \"We fully support the right of parents to opt their children out of standardised assessments. Where parents have concerns or state a clear wish to opt their children out we would advise that parents make this known to the headteacher.\"  Jackie Brock, chief executive of Children in Scotland, said: \"There is no legal basis for insisting that P1 children be tested. There is also zero credible evidence that children will benefit from being tested at this early age.  \"It\u0027s time to call a halt to this wasteful and damaging approach, which is opposed by organisations across the education sector.\"  The government stressed that parents had no statutory right to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling - other than some parts of religious education.  The Scottish Government spokeswoman added: \"If a parent does not wish their child to take part in an aspect of teaching and learning, they can discuss this with their school. This is the same position as has existed for decades.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the assessments as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  However, critics claim they are too stressful for the youngest pupils with feedback highlighting cases where pupils were left distressed - particularly when whole groups were assessed together."},{"url":null,"title":"angela-haggerty-let-the-orange-lodge-step-back-but-continue-marching","story":"  It released a statement last week declaring it had fallen victim to a \u0026ldquoreligious no-go zone after it was ordered to re-route a parade away from St Alphonsus church in Glasgow, after reports last month that a priest had been attacked and parishioners heckled as they left mass during an Orange Walk. In response, Glasgow City Council insisted the lodge change the route of a later march, which was again due to pass St Alphonsus church. Unhappy with the request, the lodge cancelled the march altogether.  In its subsequent statement, the lodge said: \u0026ldquoIn order to offer concessions \u0026hellip we identified the times of the service in the church and proposed times to avoid this. All of this was rejected. We were simply told that some streets are now no-go zones based simply and horrifically on religious beliefs.  \u0026ldquoThis is religious intolerance, nothing less.  It went on to suggest an alternative approach: that the parade should be allowed to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquos and parishioners should all come outside to greet the march. They could all \u0026ldquowish each other well and carry on with our own lives, it said.  I must admit, I didn\u0026rsquot realise the lodge had a sideline in comedy. The notion that an Orange march passing a Catholic church, where only recently a priest was reportedly attacked in similar circumstances, could magically become an exercise in religious harmony was truly brilliant. It\u0026rsquos impressive spin, I\u0026rsquoll give it that.  If it\u0026rsquos genuinely interested in improving relations with the Catholic Church as an institution and public perceptions of it, perhaps it should consider how Catholics feel about these marches.  As a Catholic who grew up on the Isle of Bute, I hadn\u0026rsquot encountered an Orange march in the flesh until I moved to Glasgow a number of years ago. However, I\u0026rsquod met and known plenty of people who would strongly identify with the lodge, which describes itself as the \u0026ldquooldest and biggest Protestant fraternity in Scotland, and organisation of people \u0026ldquobonded together to promote the ideals of our faith.  It would be an understatement to say I did not have good experiences with those people. It was abundantly clear that I was considered inferior and problematic. These views and attitudes may not reflect how the lodge would like itself to be seen in the modern age, but there\u0026rsquos no denying it exists among its followers.  During my first summer in Glasgow, I\u0026rsquod find myself awoken at the weekends by the banging of drums and the sound of flutes. It\u0026rsquos a very odd experience to wake to the beating of a drum I felt was designed to let me know my place. As I became used to the schedule of marches, I\u0026rsquod purposely avoid certain areas. On the day of the biggest Orange march in Glasgow \u0026ndash the week before the 12th of July events in Belfast \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod avoid going out altogether or leave the city. I know many other Catholics who do the same.  On one occasion, I stepped out of the house and accidentally right into the oncoming path of a parade. I initially froze, and then in a panic, ran. Was it likely that anything untoward would happen? No. But that wasn\u0026rsquot the point. These events instil a certain fear among many Catholics. The lodge can argue until its heart is content that there\u0026rsquos no danger, but it is simply wrong to dismiss how Catholics feel about it. We are a minority in Scotland and, according to hate crime statistics, a highly targeted one.  For me, it\u0026rsquos a no-brainer that the lodge should avoid being part of the intimidating atmosphere created by marches passing Catholic churches. If it is serious about exhibiting good relations with Catholics it shouldn\u0026rsquot be calling on us to step out of churches, while fearing for our safety, to help it prove a point.  But all of that said, there\u0026rsquos an element of the lodge\u0026rsquos concerns that I do sympathise with. Amongst the debate about all of this, it\u0026rsquos clear that some of the condemnation of the lodge does not originate from a place of concern about balancing religious freedoms, but rather of religious intolerance.  I may not like Orange walks, but in principle I support the right of its members and supporters to march. The Orange Lodge is an easy target for those who do not believe the state should accommodate expressions of religious freedom. Just as they\u0026rsquod decry Orange walks, these are often the same people who would have complained that the visit of Pope Benedict to Glasgow in 2010 cost too much money and disruption to justify.  And so, to an extent I actually do share the lodge\u0026rsquos concern, and that\u0026rsquos why I hope it will step back from this ludicrous determination to march past Catholic churches. In the end, all it will be is a gift to those who really want to see the end of the lodge, and it may be surprised to find that this attitude isn\u0026rsquot coming from Catholics."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-farron-tells-pro-eu-tory-and-labour-mps-to-form-new-party","story":"  Mr Farron said that the Lib Dems would not join the new party but would \u0026ldquowork with them.

Speaking in Paris at the Mouvement des Entreprises de France conference, Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoWith exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal.  The Cabinet Office Minister explained that the suggested alternative models did \u0026ldquonot meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered.  \"So, Mr Lidington urged, \u0026ldquowe need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.\"  He then warned: \u0026ldquoI truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.  But the Cabinet minister also sought to allay fears within the EU27 that Britain\u0026rsquos desire to have a close relationship on goods but a looser one on services would reduce red tape for British businesses, enabling them to undercut their continental competitors, and give them a \u0026pound6 billion Brexit dividend.  \u0026ldquoOur proposals would ensure a level playing field, declared Mr Lidington, \u0026ldquowith commitments on areas like state aid, environmental, social and employment protections and other regulatory standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe understand that the EU is concerned that we could lower our standards to gain a competitive advantage but these concerns are completely unfounded. Like France, we view economic growth, consumer and worker protection and sustainable development as going together hand in hand, not as trade-offs.  At Westminster during a one-off session of the Lords EU Committee during the summer recess, Mr Raab again insisted he was confident that a deal was \u0026ldquowithin our sights.  He told peers: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.\"  The Brexit Secretary also confirmed that the deadline for a deal, once put at the October 18/19 European Council, could \u0026ldquocreep beyond that, and slip into November.  On the Northern Irish border, he suggested there was still no agreed solution but stressed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had confirmed he was open to new solutions on the backstop.  \"He has acknowledged the position could be amended or improved. What I can say is we\u0027re both committed to a solution and there is a lot of interesting, innovative technical work to make sure we resolve it,\" explained the Secretary of State.  He made clear nothing had been ruled out on the Northern Irish border.  \"We\u0027re not going to see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea. We\u0027re not going to do anything which would imperil the Belfast Agreement.

Now the pupils at one school have voted to turn their back on their daily fashion parade after voting overwhelmingly to adopt a uniform of for the first time.  Youngsters of Westhill Academy, Aberdeen, even turned their backs on the chance to opt for a more smart-but-casual outfit of polo tops and sweaters, and instead picked formal shirts, ties and blazers for their daily attire.  The school has had a permanent \u0027come-as-you-please\u0027 dress-code since it opened 1979, but plans were made to change tack for the start of this academic year.    The pupils voted for shirts over polo tops   Alison Reid, the new head teacher at the 1,000-pupil secondary school, decided to make the switch after noticing a growing interest in uniforms among her pupils.  She said: \"I took over as head teacher in August this year, and from when I was appointed I saw there was an appetite for introducing a uniform at the school.  \"Instead of taking the decision to introduce one I decided to have a consultation which asked all the stakeholders in the school if Westhill Academy should have a uniform.  \"I thought this was a good idea as I felt like I was hearing just one side of the argument.  \"When I spoke to some of the pupils in the school their biggest concern was when they were representing the school at events and didn\u0027t seem to have an identity.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchool uniform policy \u0027creating inequality amongst children\u0027  Ms Reid added: \"The school\u0027s been open for 39 years, and we had hoodies and a dress code, but this is the first time that they\u0027ve had an actual uniform.\"  The results of the vote were decisively in favour of bringing in a smart uniform, with pupils backing the proposal by three to one.  Students were consulted throughout the process and the new uniform came into force on the first day of the new academic year last Tuesday.    Sajiyah Zahara, an S2 pupil at the school, said she thought herself and her classmates look \"a lot smarter\".  She said: \"When I found out that we were actually getting a uniform, I was quite excited.\"  Orlagh Fraser, an S6 pupil, added: \"It\u0027s definitely different, because you don\u0027t have to think about what you wear in the morning, which is definitely a good thing.\"  However, S6 pupil Shaan Singh was originally against the idea.  He said: \"I did say that I didn\u0027t want it, but after wearing it, I feel like it\u0027s better.  \"Previously I was at another school where we did have to wear a uniform and I wasn\u0027t a big fan of it.  \"When I came here we were given a bit more freedom, and I didn\u0027t want that to be taken away, but I\u0027ve come around to the idea.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchools told to ditch blazers in purge on expensive uniform  Uniforms have become a thorny issue for some families in recent years, with the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee urging schools to step back from insisting upon expensive blazers and other items when setting out their dress code in an effort to spare less-well-off families budgets.  This year Headteachers were also told to stop sending pupils home if they have missing or dirty school uniform, after a wide-ranging inquiry into the impact of poverty on education.  Yet this follows a resurgence in school uniform within the state sector, with many adopting expensive policies of the private sector such as the introduction of more formal clothing.    Each of Scotland\u0027s 32 councils are responsible for the schools in their area, and there is no national policy on uniforms.  The Scottish government said that about 120,000 families would benefit, with eligibility decided at a local level.  Annual costs for the change will be about \u0026pound12m, with costs split between government and individual councils.

She said: \"Given how much we consulted them over the course of last year, we got all that done and dusted before the start of this year.  \"All the conversations that we had with pupils and parents are in the past now, and the consensus was that they were ready to go when we came back.  \"So far, we\u0027ve had pretty much 100 per cent in uniform.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7845554.jpg?type=article-full","title":"no-decision-yet-from-sfa-over-whether-to-stick-with-hampden","story":"  The seven-strong Scottish FA board met for several hours on Wednesday, but could not\u0026nbspcome to a conclusion.

Its Public Performance Measure  \u0026ndash which records services arriving within five minutes of their scheduled time \u0026ndash has sunk to 88.2 per cent, below the target of 92.13%.  It is the third period in a row that the figures have been a record low for Abellio, with opposition parties piling pressure on new SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow transport secretary Colin Smyth said: \u0026ldquoMr Matheson\u0026rsquos honeymoon period is over and it\u0026rsquos time for him to get a grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos railways as passengers face more delays yet are expected to pay more for tickets.  \u0026ldquoWhen the SNP handed the franchise to Abellio, they said it would be a \u0027world leading\u0027 deal, but the reality for Scotland\u0026rsquos hard-pressed passengers has been anything but with hikes in fares, overcrowding, delays and stop skipping.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to bring this SNP rail chaos to an end and return our railways back into public hands.  \u0026ldquoFranchising has failed passengers and staff and that\u0026rsquos why Labour is fighting for publicly owned railways which will serve the many, not just the few.

At Edinburgh Waverley, less than half of services were on time. At Glasgow Queen Street, just 55.8% were.  Abellio took over the ScotRail franchise in 2015, but Scottish ministers are now putting together a public sector bid for the railways.  Last week it emerged the state-owned company behind CalMac is exploring bidding for the ScotRail franchise when it ends in 2025.  A ScotRail spokesman said it knows performance need to be better and it shares the frustration of its customers when things don\u0026rsquot go according to plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe investment we are making in new and upgraded trains, and our recruitment drive to increase the number of people working on our frontline, will help us significantly in enhancing the day-to-day running of services.  \u0026ldquoWe are building the best railway Scotland has ever had and service performance is a huge part of this delivery. Everyone at ScotRail is working together to deliver these improvements.  It is understood almost half of ScotRail\u0027s performance issues related to infrastructure, which is the responsibility of Network Rail.  Signalling failures at Yoker and Rutherglen East Junction, as well as flooding at Dalmuir, were among the top incidents to hit services.  A Scottish Government spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs has been stated on many previous occasions ministers expect the ScotRail Alliance to work closely together to build on lessons learned going forward.  \u0026ldquoWe have already secured the right for a public sector operator to bid for a rail franchise in Scotland \u0026ndash after being denied by previous UK Governments \u0026ndash which will enable a level playing field between the private and public sector in bidding for rail franchises for the benefit of passengers and best value for the public purse.  \u0026ldquoWe should not lose sight of the transformational process underway on our railways including the infrastructure enhancements, as well as the introduction of new and fully re-furbished rolling stock with the additional services that they will provide.  \u0026ldquoIn recent years 160 extra carriages were added to ScotRail\u0026rsquos fleet with an extra 200 to follow in the next 12 months giving a 50% increase in carriages since 2007."},{"url":null,"title":"port-giant-accused-of-sacrificing-clyde-to-save-mersey","story":"  Peel Ports \u0026ndash which owns and manages swathes of land along the West Coast \u0026ndash have always denied favouring their substantial holdings in England.

The \u0026pound1.34 billion crossing over the Firth of Forth opened to traffic on August 30 last year as a replacement for traffic using the Forth Road Bridge , coming in under budget but completed eight months later than first estimated.  Since the new bridge opened, there have been 14 occasions when the FRB would have had to close to high sided vehicles, Transport Scotland said.  On the Queensferry Crossing it typically takes around one hour to restore normal traffic conditions following an incident, compared to one to five hours on the FRB.  An Audit Scotland report published earlier this month found the Queensferry Crossing project was managed effectively and delivered value for money.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The recent Audit Scotland report recognised the Queensferry Crossing as having delivered its objective of providing a more reliable road link between the Lothians and Fife.  \"One year on since opening the new bridge, we are today providing further evidence that shows how reliability of journeys over the Forth have improved in the last twelve months.  \"This is in sharp contrast to the lengthy delays seen in the past on the Forth Road Bridge, where an accident or breakdown resulted in huge tailbacks and much longer journeys over the bridge and the surrounding road networks.  \"The impacts of incidents on the Queensferry Crossing have been much reduced by making use of the hard shoulders to assist in quicker response times in the recovery of vehicles and allowing for the ability to maintain two lanes of traffic.  \"There are clear and significant economic benefits from this reliable crossing for both industry and commuters alike, I am pleased to see this has been recognised by the road haulage industry today.\"  However he said the fact the contractor is still carrying out remedial and finishing work at night has an impact on those travelling outside of peak hours and has asked Transport Scotland officials to obtain an update on the work.  The road haulage industry said the new bridge has been of benefit to the Scottish economy.  Seamus Leheny, Freight Transport Association policy manager, said: \"At a time when reliable trading links across the country, and with the rest of Europe, are more critical than ever before, the Queensferry Crossing has quickly established itself as a vital component in the UK\u0027s supply chain.  \"Its ability to remain open when other options are closed by the severe weather conditions frequently experienced in this part of the world are a godsend for businesses on both sides of the border.\"  Martin Reid of the Road Haulage Association added: \"The importance of road transport to the Scottish economy and its supply chain cannot be overstated and so the Forth Crossing is a vital route to cities and major conurbations along the East Coast.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-benedetti-unveils-plan-to-expand-music-education-programme","story":"  However now Nicola Benedetti, fresh from two lauded concerts at the Edinburgh International Festival, said she is to increase and intensify her emphasis on music education.  She is to juggle new education projects with her glittering professional career beginning with a new series of masterclasses, called Super String Sessions, in four cities in Scotland next week.  An outspoken advocate of music tuition in schools, Ms Benedetti said her future plans for education works are \"if anything, way too ambitious.\"  Benedetti is to help teach 500 young people in the fundamentals, and finer points, of strings at four events in Scotland, with the Super Strings events, staffed with teachers from the Big Noise youth orchestras, in Aberdeen, Stirling, Dundee and Glasgow.  There will be more next year, and she has ambitions for more - and her educational drives will be \"formalised\" next year.  Last month, she became President of the European String Teachers Association, and is also involved in bodies such as the National Children\u0027s Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland and Music in Secondary Schools.  Ms Benedetti has long campaigned against cuts to instrumental teaching in schools, and earlier this year said music learning had been \"left to decay in many British schools.\"  She said: \"My plans are, if anything, way too ambitious.  \"There will be many, many more workshops, and not just for students, but for teachers too.  \"I just prioritise, and schedule it. It\u0026rsquos not easy, because different things come at different times, and it is hard to resist things that you want to do professionally, but its just really that much of a priority for me.\"  Of the Super String sessions, she said she wanted to connect with young musicians not directly in the catchment areas of the four Big Noise orchestras, for which she is a patron.  The violinist said: \u0026ldquoIt stems from a general desire from me that the expertise that Sistema Scotland [which runs the Big Noise] has built up over the last ten years is shared with more and more children.  \"It\u0027s something that I\u0026rsquove really desperate to happen more and more.\"  The increasingly uneven provision of music tuition continues to concerns her.  She said: \"That is our society: that is British society, it is an uneven one: it is not one that gives equal opportunity to all children, and that affects music - insofar as music is absolutely not taught in a high number of schools.  \u0026ldquoTo teach an instrument is hard, to teach it well is even harder, and to make sure that a teacher is equipped with what is needed to teach a child the violin - a lifetime of study is required for that.\"  Super Strings will culminate in a festival of Strings Day at the Caird Hall, Dundee on 9 October.  Ms Benedetti said she will also continue to speak out about music tuition and the value of music to children and to society.  She said: \"I think, with the exception of the post-World War Two period, money for anything that does not seem absolutely necessary and immediate is something that you constantly have to fight for.  \"I do think that some very strong arguments are being made for it in Scotland, and some of them are being won.  \"But we do hear, week in and week out, of a new council that is in danger of losing its ability to give children music lessons for free, which of course just exacerbates the difference in experience from those who have, and those have less.  \"Music and the arts, because its so difficult to quantify, because it deals with a lot of invisible things, it fits less neatly into charts and tables and statistics.  \"All of these decisions are detrimental to putting music and creativity and the arts, never mind at the heart of education, or anywhere close to a priority in education.\"  In the last year she has taught more than 1000 children in workshops, masterclasses, partnership projects, and school visits, and estimates she has met more than 100 teachers.  However Ms Benedetti does not plan to set up an educational institution, like the Yehudi Menuhin School, which she attended as a young musician.  She said: \"I don\u0027t want to lose my mobility.  \"I don\u0027t want to lose the unbiased collaborative spirit, I want to be able to be putting on workshops up and down the country, with people I can work with collaboratively, with charities, primary school teachers, and institutions of all types.\""},{"url":null,"title":"anm provides practical advice to farmers","story":"        Local farmers received some winter fodder advice from ANM recently.                An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month. Over a four-week period and 63 cows, this will result in 11 tonnes less of fodder supplies used. While, focus farmer Jim Gammie reported success using woodchips over the last two years, which he is also composting for further land use.Those interested in finding out more or getting involved in a focus group, are invited to get in touch with Declan or Robert on 01467 623 838 or farmprofit@anmgroup, or by stopping by the Farm Profit Programme office located in the concourse at Thainstone Centre.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 9:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 9:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire. QinetiQ employs 6000 staff and has a turnover of around \u0026pound700 million.The deal comes as AMTE Power has invested \u0026pound1.5 million in a new automated production line at its Caithness operation.John Fox, the company\u0026rsquos marketing director, yesterday described the partnership agreement as \u0026ldquoa positive step for AMTE Power and the local economy.He explained the two business will work together to develop battery cells.\u0026ldquoWe will use our manufacturing expertise to utilise QinetiQ\u0026rsquos experience in battery technology and research to deliver new products, manufactured in Thurso to an international customer base, Mr Fox said.He said the companies will concentrate on four key areas: defence, the oil and gas industry, energy storage and electric vehicles. They plan to supply UK and European markets with niche batteries which customers would not be able to get elsewhere.Mr Fox said there is potential and opportunities in these areas and the increase in the Thurso workforce will be largely due to the link-up with QinetiQ.The partnership deal, he stressed, will allow customers to get products which \u0026ldquodon\u0026rsquot rely on standard mass-produced cells from the existing supply chain.The agreement will enable the companies to develop \u0026ldquoa mutually beneficial relationship and lead to advances in batteries and energy storage products.\u0026ldquoOur staff in Thurso are fantastic and we will continue to grow our base there, he said. \u0026ldquoWe have 32 employees in Caithness at present but have plans for that figure to go up to 40 over the next year \u0026ndash that is a 25 per cent increase.\u0026ldquoThis is a great building block for the future development of the organisation. We have had great support from the community and are committed to Thurso and Caithness.Kevin Brundish, chief executive of AMTE Power, said: \u0026ldquoThe combination of world-leading British innovation from QinetiQ coupled with the manufacturing capability of AMTE allows customers access to new and exciting energy storage options, giving them a choice beyond the existing supply chain.\u0026ldquoThe new products will see step change in capability and alternative options for our technology customers.Mike Sewart of QinetiQ said: \u0026ldquoWe recognise that our strengths lie in research, prototyping and scale-up of cutting-edge battery technology and not in large-scale manufacturing. This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 9:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 9:42 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people.

Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For an entry form, please go to www.rewdt.org. Alternatively, entry forms can be picked up in Trek and Travel and Cycle Orkney in Kirkwall, or entrants can also come along on the day and register before the race.This year’s lap will once again start at the pier and the race will be anti-clockwise around the island, finishing by Trumland House.Another run and walk is set to be held in Westray, with the biannual Bisgeos 12-mile run/walk.The 12-mile run/walk starts from Rapness Terminal at 10am, while a one-mile run and walk will take place from Quoys, Westside from 11am.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 9:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.\nThe youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.\nYear of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to 26 years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nThursday 30 Aug 2018 9:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nThursday 30 Aug 2018 9:43 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/HOUSING-KYLE-1.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We must build on this while retaining those positive traditions and values that help to define us and which have withstood the test of time and adversity.\n“The visit of the Pope Francis can and should contribute to the new and positive relationship which has been developing between the Irish state and the Catholic Church,\" she explained. \n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27463  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nThe Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south.- Conor Murphy\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity to address the deep hurt caused by the abuses of the church and engage with victims and survivors, Sinn Féin\u0027s Conor Murphy has said. \nThe Newry and Armagh MLA and former minister will be Sinn Féin\u0027s representative at a reception for the Pope at Dublin Castle on Saturday which will also be attended by An Taoiseach, ministers, the diplomatic corps and other representatives of civil society. \nSinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson will also attend the event and Sinn Féin will be represented at each of the public events in the Pope\u0027s itinerary. \nProtests will also be held to coincide with Pope Francis\u0027 visit and Sinn Féin representatives will attend the Stand for Truth solidarity vigil at Dublin\u0027s Garden of Remembrance on Sunday in support of victims and survivors on clerical sex abuse. \nSpeaking to An Phoblacht ahead of the visit, Conor Murphy said that while Pope Francis\u0027 visit is a significant event which will be welcomed by many Catholics, it will be a difficult occasion for many, particularly those who have been affected by abuse at the hand of the church. \n\"There is no doubt that this visit by Pope Francis\u0027 to Ireland is hugely significant. It is only the second visit by a Pope to Ireland and has generated huge interest, particularly in recent weeks and days. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from right across the island are expected to travel to Dublin and Knock for the Papal events and countless more will be watching the events in the media. \n\n\"While for many this will be an occasion of celebration, for a significant group in our society it will also be a very difficult and challenging time. \n\"Many Irish people have suffered and have been deeply hurt by the abuses of the church over many decades, particularly the victims and survivors of child sex abuse and those who suffered in industrial schools, mother and baby homes and the Magdalene laundries. \n\"Many of them will have a very different view of this visit and I am very conscious of their views and acknowledge how difficult it will be for them,\" he said. \nConor Murphy said the Papal visit provides an opportunity for the Catholic church authorities to address the issue of abuse. \n\"For decades the Catholic church sought to cover up the horrendous abuse and this only compounded the hurt and suffering of victims and survivors. \n\"Hopefully this visit will provide an opportunity for that deep hurt to be acknowledged by the church hierarchy. But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27465  ","story":" Mícheál Mac Donncha\n\nON THE afternoon of Tuesday 30 August 1988, three IRA Volunteers were travelling along the main Omagh to Carrickmore road in County Tyrone. They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8615613.1535442232!/image/image.jpg","title":"fundraising abseil in aid of action ms","story":"\nA fundraising abseil was recently organised by the staff at Thompson House Hospital in aid of Action MS.\n\n                \nA team  including neurologist Dr Stella Hughes, Nurse Sarah McCallan and administrator Laura Fisher scaled the dizzy heights of the Europa Hotel.

The results are amazing and they have clearly drawn inspiration from a iety of sources.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“I would like to congratulate all our finalists, Andrew Moore, James Magennis and Charles Leathem, who have each taken some of our iconic packaging and transformed it into a catwalk sensation, showcasing the raw talent of some of our stars of the future.”\n\nClaire Concannon, course co-ordinator from Belfast politan College, added: “Working with crisp packaging has been a very valuable learning experience for our ingenious students who have more than risen to the challenge. The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks. The company remains family-owned by the Hutchinsons and is now run by Thomas’s children.

Championships clicked into gear at the weekend with a mixed bag of results for city teams.\nIn the Bathshack Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, St John’s booked their place in Group Two alongside Rossa and Loughgiel as they defeated Ballycastle 2-21 to 2-13at Corrigan Park in their second leg tie to win 59-37 on aggregate.\nThe Johnnies wasted no time in adding to their 14-point pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein demands eu

Fein has called for the creation of a EU constituency for Northern Ireland post-Brexit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n.push\n\n\nSinn Fein MEP Martina Anderson said it was crucial that Northern Ireland citizens retain democratic representation in the European Union, especially as the majority of Northern Ireland voted to remain.\n\nSinn Fein published its submission to the Constituency Convention dealing with the upcoming European elections and the number of Irish seats increasing in the face of Brexit, which includes the creation of a constituency for the north which would have two seats.\n\nSpeaking on Wednesday, Ms Anderson called the constituency vital and said it was important Northern Irish people were not treated as second class citizens.\n\n\n“Let us not forget that the north did not vote for Brexit.\n\n“British and Irish citizens from the north of Ireland deserve representation in the European Parliament and this is what we are proposing today.” - \n@M_AndersonSF\n \npic.twitter/Urc5E0cYCR\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n“Sinn Fein believe that it is vital that the citizens of the north continue to be represented in the European Parliament.\n\n“What we are asking for is to ensure we have representation from Derry to Kerry.\n\n“We are not asking for voters in the south to sacrifice existing representation, merely help preserve that right for those who did not vote for Brexit but are now forced to accept the ramifications of others’ shortsightedness.\n\n“We are willing to work with the Commission to tease out the idea of representation for the north, but we are here today to stand for EU citizens in the north and their rights which some would see stripped away.”\n\nMs Anderson said the party were willing to work with any of Ireland’s political parties in order to see the constituency created, and said the proposal required a hand of friendship.\n\n“We’re willing to work with An Taoiseach, and let us remember that the Taoiseach has already told us that no Irish government would ever again leave behind the people of the north,” she said.\n\nIn their proposal document Sinn Fein referenced Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin who said in January 2018: “Why would people object to Northern Ireland continuing to have representation in the European Parliament?”\n\nAs well as Fine Gael TD Sean Kelly, who said in June, that the idea was “worth exploring”.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nThe border between Londonderry and Donegal at Bridgend \n\n\n\n\nMs Anderson claimed Brexiteers were taking Northern Ireland over a cliff, and labelled comments by Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg that people should be “inspected” at the border post-Brexit, as dangerous.\n\n“The comments are a reflection of the attitudes within the Conservative government, he is reckless, he is wrong, he is an absolute idiot.\n\n“We do not want the damage that is going to be caused by Brexit, we do not want the north to be collateral damage, we were in a terrible place, war is a terrible place and we’re out of that.\n\n“We the people of Ireland, and north of Ireland, were told that the constitutional position of the north would not change unless we consented to it, and we did not consent to the wreckage that is going to happen as a consequence of Brexit.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast primark building so

Water from the River Lagan was used to douse the flames.\n\nMr Jennings described the conditions facing firefighters as \"very difficult\" with \"extreme\" temperatures.\n\n\"On a number of occasions we had to withdraw fire crews from the concrete stairs due to the collapses inside the building causing heat,\" he said.\n\n\"This has been very much a team effort, not just with fire crew but all agencies.\"\n\nFirefighters are continuing to deal with hot spots and areas of rubble, stock and timber burning under the collapsed structures.\n\nNIFRS said that the exterior of the building \"remains structurally intact\" but that it was working with engineers to \"determine the structural integrity and safety of the building\".\n\nDescribing the incident as \"ongoing\", it added that operations were \"expected to be scaled back to three fire appliances\" last night. \n\n\"There continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45-metre exclusion zone remains in place,\" NIFRS added.\n\n\"There has been structural collapse within the building today.\n\n\"The exterior of the building remains structurally intact. \n\n\"We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause.\n\n\"In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties.\"\n\nNIFRS confirmed that the building had a sprinkler system, but added that \"fire investigation will determine if the sprinkler system was activated and whether this would have had any impact on such an aggressive fire\".\n\nIt added: \"Building regulations define whether commercial premises are required to have a sprinkler system fitted. This is determined by the premises type and the size of the floor or compartment area.\"\n\nThe USDAW union, which represents Primark workers, said it had met the company yesterday.\n\nIt confirmed that all staff will be paid up until the end of the week.\n\nUnion area organiser Michala Lafferty said that further discussions will take place over the next few days to agree what happens next.\n\nShe said: \"Our members are extremely distressed and concerned as they now enter a period of uncertainty.\n\n\"The company has reassured me that the welfare and job security of the staff is their priority.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former kincora boys home building on market for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"high flying mary 99 makes special return to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC

I had a truly wonderful time and meeting my family after all this time was the icing on the cake. It was fantastic to see them all again - we shared wonderful memories together and it was like a trip down memory lane. I never thought I would get to do this aged 99 but it just shows that anything is possible.\"\n\nCarolina Martinoli, British Airways\u0027 director of Brand and Customer Experience, said: \"From one 99-year-old to another, we are so pleased we could help Mary see her family ahead of her 100th birthday.\"\n\nEllen Bannister, Mary\u0027s carer of six years, added: \"It was absolutely amazing and I\u0027m so glad that I could be a part of the adventure. It was really emotional watching Mary meet her family again.

They shared photos and exchanged memories, it was a beautiful day.\"\n\nAugust 25, 1919 was the day Aircraft Transport and Travel began the world\u0027s first scheduled international air service from London to Paris.\n\nBankrupt the following year, that service was merged into the new Daimler Airway, which in turn merged with three airlines in 1924 to form Imperial Airways. In 1939 that airline was incorporated into the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which merged with British European Airways to form British Airways on March 31, 1974.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts delays in belfast centre after primark blaze","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mr Casey promised not to accept any of the €1.7m salary which the president will be entitled to between 2018 and 2025. He described the salary as \"bonkers\". \n\n\"It\u0027s almost the same as the US president. It\u0027s much more than the Taoiseach who does the heavy lifting. It\u0027s just wrong. I wouldn\u0027t take any,\" he said. \n\nMr Higgins is entitled to a salary of €325,000 but has gifted 23% of this back to the State each year, bringing his annual income down to €249,000. \n\nThe father of five adult children accepts that he is best-known for his stint on reality TV - but would \"hate to think that you are eliminated from standing for office just because you were on a TV show\". \n\nHe is the third \u0027Dragon\u0027 to challenge Mr Higgins, following in the footsteps of Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffy. \n\nThe Derry native who founded recruitment firm Claddagh Resources now lives in Atlanta. However, he recently signed over his company interest to his son and sold his American home ahead of a permanent move back to Ireland. \n\nHis campaign will be largely based around trying to harness the strength of Ireland\u0027s diaspora. He wants to replicate the \u0027Birthright Israel\u0027 programme which allows the children of ex-pats to travel to Israel on sponsored heritage trips. \n\nAsked why he believes he would do a better job than Mr Higgins, he replied: \"He certainly hasn\u0027t embarrassed the presidency. He\u0027s kept the seat warm but there is so much opportunity for connecting the Irish. \n\n\"The president is the president of all Irish people, not just those living in Ireland.\"\n\nHe added: \"I wouldn\u0027t have supported him going to Cuba and supporting Fidel Castro… or extolling the virtues of Hugo Chavez. I\u0027d like to hear his answers as what justified using taxpayers\u0027 money to go to these countries,\" he said. \n"},{"url":null,"title":"government called to account by housing campaigners over shortage of homes","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Australia and TPG Telecom will create a “more powerful challenger to Telstra and Optus in Australia”.\n\nVodafone Australia, owned by Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison and Vodafone Group, will have a majority 50.1% stake in the merged group.\n\nTPG will hold the remaining 49.9% stake in the group, which will be called TPG Telecom Limited and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange.\n\nThere are no plans to rename the existing VHA or TPG brands.\n\n\n\nThe combined listed company will be a more capable challenger to Telstra and Optus, and will be much better placed to invest in next-generation mobile and fixed-line services to benefit Australian consumers and businesses\nNick Read, chief executive designate of Vodafone\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nThe firms said the merger is expected to generate “substantial” cost savings as they plan to cut out duplicated costs and use their economies of scale.\n\nThe new group will have combined revenues of more than six billion Australian dollars  and underlying earnings of more than 1.8 billion Australian dollars .\n\nNick Read, chief executive designate of Vodafone, said: “This transaction accelerates Vodafone’s converged communications strategy in Australia and is consistent with our proactive approach to enhance the value of our portfolio of businesses.\n\n“The combined listed company will be a more capable challenger to Telstra and Optus, and will be much better placed to invest in next-generation mobile and fixed-line services to benefit Australian consumers and businesses.”\n\nIt is expected the merger will complete in 2019, subject to regulatory and shareholder approval.\n\nShares were trading 2% lower after the announcement.\n\nThe combined group will be headed by TPG boss David Teoh as chairman, with VHA chief executive Inaki Berroeta as managing director and chief executive.\n\nThe deal comes as Vodafone is also merging its Indian operations with Idea Cellular, which will help it weather the tough conditions in the market.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"12 everyday things that might as well be classified as","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

We are super excited about the new arrival and hope the new family member will be as quick as Bertie.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new baby tortoise is currently in the capable hands of the animal team and on show to the public in Creature Corner. \n\nIf it has anything like the pace of its father, they’ll do well to keep a close eye on it.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"appreciated im not 100 per cent sure hopefully derry city chairman philip odoherty speaks recent criticism magee university","story":"\nBy Gary Ferry\n\n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\nHE provides almost a thousand jobs locally and has saved Derry City Football Club on two occasions, but for some, Philip O’Doherty is still not exempt from criticism.\n\nRecent reports to Derry City FC’s shareholders have revealed that the club’s Chairman has contributed £300,000 of his own money on an annual basis, just to keep the club afloat.\n\nOn top of that, he has built E\u0026ampI Engineering to a stature that it is respected across the world, a real jewel in the Irish landscape that sits in Burnfoot.\n\nIn its 32nd year in operation, E\u0026ampI is still growing, with a new extension set to be completed on site by the end of October. \n\nThat will bring yet more jobs to the local economy, north and south of the border, news of which will be lauded by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he visits E\u0026ampI on September 11. \n\nSo when an angry Derry City fan accosts him whilst doing his shopping in Sainsburys, or when he is socialising with friends, what is his response?\n\n“The first question I usually ask them is ‘Are you a season ticket holder or do you go to the matches?’ If the answer is no then there is no point in me talking to them,” he states. \n\n“Why are they criticising if they don’t go to the matches and pay their money? If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry country park looking actors spooky flair star halloween events","story":"\nA Derry outdoor pursuit’s facility has put out a call for local actors with a flair for all things spooky.\n\nCreggan Country Park is looking for experienced performers aged 18 and over to star in their Halloween events.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor more information email \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt man enlisted help pop icon britney spears dublin concert","story":"\nBy Orla Mullan\n\nMOST people can only dream about getting a chance to work for top US pop icons such as Britney Spears.\n\nHowever, for one Magherafelt man, that dream became a reality last week.\n\nChris Graham, owner of Barbers of BT45 was chosen to cut all the male backing dancers’ hair before Spears’ Dublin gig on August 20.\n\nThe ‘Piece of Me’ concert, held in 3Arena, was part of the star’s first world tour in seven years and was an immediate sell out, attended by thousands of fans.\n\nThe once-in-a-lifetime opportunity came about following a meeting between Chris and the US pop sensation’s team at Brighton Pride earlier this month.\n\nChris, who was attending the UK’s biggest pride festival, said: “I had worked in Disney World ten years ago and was in Brighton attending her concert with past Disney friends who knew her team. We were invited to join them all backstage. It was incredible, we were on their tour buses, seen all the supporting acts, and got to experience what behind the scenes of a festivaI is actually like. I was talking to her team and they asked me what I did for a living.  When I told them I was a barber, they said they might need someone to cut their hair during the Dublin leg of Britney Spears’ tour.\n\n“I received initial contact two weeks ago asking if I would go to Dublin to cut the eight male dancers’ hair.”\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize

Matty Young, Cathal McCormack, Marty McErlean and Megan Ludlow.  Unfortunately, Megan was unable to make the trip due to a prior engagement, but the other lads were delighted to take on their biggest job to date.\n\nChris, a former student of Holy Family Primary School and St Pius X College in Magherafelt, said it was a great ‘honour’ to be chosen to work for ‘one of the biggest selling pop artists of all time’.\n\n“The boys who work for me have all been trained by me and they were so professional throughout it all.  I couldn’t be prouder of them.  The dancers were so happy with their haircuts and it also gave the boys their first glimpse of working within the world of celebrities and session styling.”\n\nChris, who has 15 years’ experience in the barbering industry, opened Barbers of BT45 almost five years ago and since then he has seen the business go from strength-to-strength with the opening of Barbers of BT80 in Cookstown, Salon 45 and the BT45 Barbering Academy, having trained over 120 students since it opened.\n\nA former Disney World employee, Chris has also notched up barbering experience in Australia.\n\nJust last year he launched his very own range of products and is currently in negotiations to have them distributed throughout Ireland.\n\nLast night Chris revealed that Britney Spears’ tour management team have been in contact again about future projects, however he is keeping shtum until all is finalised.\n\n“It’s great that we have got a lot more opportunities out of this.  It just shows you that one opportunity can open so many doors,” he

The words “I want to be an organ donor” are simple, but what an inspirational difference they could make. \n\nThis Organ Donation Week  the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is centred on encouraging people to talk to those closest to them about organ donation. Many people don’t realise that their family’s support is needed for organ donation to go ahead.\n\nApproximately 140 people in Northern Ireland are waiting on life-saving transplants and approximately 6,000 people in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately every year around 14 people in Northern Ireland die waiting for an organ transplant, highlighting the real shortage of organ donations.\n\nDr Declan Grace, Lead Clinician for Organ Donation at the Western Trust said: “Organ donation transforms and saves lives and the Western Trust is encouraging everyone to join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones that they wish to be a donor, so that they are aware of their wishes.\n\n“Deciding to become an organ donor is entirely your decision but it does affect your family. After your death, your next of kin will be consulted on whether your organs can be donated, even if you carry a donor card, and any decision they make will be respected. When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

The unacceptable delay of 17 minutes has caused us concern, the letter stated.\n\nBut the letter ended by warning that people who disregard advice and put to sea in unstable craft in bad conditions usually preclude rescue attempts.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash Bulldozers moved in at the weekend to begin work in Newcastle\u0026rsquos new street widening scheme \u0026mdash and one of the first landmarks of the seaside resort to get the chop was the street wall at Central Promenade.\n\nThe scheme, which should eliminate Newcastle\u0026rsquos chic-a-bloc summer traffic jams, will take more than a year to complete.\n\nIn the meantime diversions and changes in traffic flow are in operation, the main change being at Bryansford Road, which will now carry two-way traffic, and at the main access to Donard Park, which will now become an exit only, with entry beside Patton\u0026rsquos Bridge.\n\nCASTLEWELLAN \u0026mdash A Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, has offered a \u0026pound200 reward in an all-out bid to catch the thieves who stole several thousand pounds from her on Saturday.\n\nA shocked Mrs Smyth told the Recorder that over \u0026pound5,000 worth of assorted furniture was taken and that she may have little chance of recovering it.\n\nThe burglary, described by Mrs Syth, as a \u0026ldquowell organised and large scale operation, occurred in the early hours when she was asleep at her home in Ballywillwill.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy husband and I were awakened by a notice outside. My husband got up and saw people outside. They had already loaded a van with furniture and were packing other items into a car, she said.\n\nMrs Smyth plans to do everything possible to bring the burglars to justice. \u0026ldquoI am offering \u0026pound200 as a reward in an attempt to get information about the incident. I would be satisfied just to know that the offenders were safely behind bars.\n\n\u0026ldquoSomeone in the area must know who was responsible and I only hope that this reward may help in tracing them.\n\nPORTAFERRY \u0026mdash Portaferry police are investigating a mystery death which occurred in the town on Saturday. The body of 47 year-old Mr John Glenn Clugston was found lying in a tent in afield adjacent to Mountain Road.\n\nA police spokesman said that the man lived in Dundonald and that foul play was not suspected.\n\nQUOILE \u0026mdash A killer weed which has poisoned several cattle and sheep along the upper reaches of the Quoile River has brought a warning for local farmers to be on their guard.\n\nSo far the deaths have occurred on a stretch on the river between Drumaness and Rademon, but the weed is believed to be spreading.\n\nDepartment of Agriculture experts have confirmed that is Water wart, which is highly poisonous to livestock. In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly. Roots must not be left lying about.\n\nCOMBER \u0026mdash More than 6,000 \u0026lsquoBlackmen\u0026rsquo from all over Co Down will parade through Comber on Saturday for the annual August procession of the Royal Black Institution.\n\nThis is the first time in 13 years that the procession has been held in Comber and some 118 preceptories will be taking part, led by an equally high number of bands.\n\nComber, being the host district, will front the parade and others will follow in numerical order. A huge public turnout is excepted and the parade will be setting off from a field on the Ballygowan Road at 12.30pm.\n\nDOWNPATRICK \u0026mdash A compensation dispute with a landowner is now the only obstacle to Downpatrick\u0026rsquos long-awaited new car park behind Irish Street.\n\nThe car park plans were given full approval by local planners this week and a spokesman for the Department of the Environment\u0026rsquos Roads Service branch in Downpatrick said that work was hoped to get underway in this financial year.\n\nHe revealed that one landowner is still blocking the plans because he is unhappy with the compensation being offered. If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night. The hut belongs to McCartan and McAteer builders and rolls of steel wire and a pair of wire cutters were stolen.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash Heavy rain may have kept the numbers down, but \u0026pound8,000 was still raised at a garden fete organised by the William Keown Appeal Fund at Dundrum Castle on Saturday. The money raised will go towards the Northern Ireland Council for Orthopaedic Development.\n\nThe fete was opened by Mr William Harvey and comperes for the afternoon\u0026rsquos activities were Commander Bill Martin and Mr Christy Brown.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe main events were a bonny baby competition, a children\u0026rsquos fancy dress contest, children\u0026rsquos sports and a closely contested tug \u0026lsquoo war.\n\nBetween the ious events the RUC Silver Band played a selection of popular tunes and helped to keep everyone\u0026rsquos spirits up in spite of the bad weather.\n\nGAA \u0026mdash Down\u0026rsquos senior footballers failed in their bid to reach their first All-Ireland final since 1968 when they went under to a smooth and rampaging Dublin by a margin of 1-16 to 0-8 in Sunday\u0026rsquos semi-final at Croke Park.\n\nIt is doubtful if there is any team that could have lived with the \u0026lsquoDubs\u0026rsquo as they hit top form in this entertaining game in front of a crowd of 50,000.\n\nDown team: M McCabe, T McGovern, M Turley, M Sands, C Digney , B Toner, P Murtagh, C McAlarney , L Austin , B Gardner, M Cunningham, W Walsh , J Byrne, P Rooney, J Digney.
